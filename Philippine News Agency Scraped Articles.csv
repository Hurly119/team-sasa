MANILA – Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go is eyeing the presidential seat next year, President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday.
Duterte made the announcement when he introduced Go during the inauguration of the newly-constructed Port Operations Building at the Port of Dumaguete in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.
In his speech, he said Go had asked him a favor to tell the public about the lawmaker’s supposed plan to join the 2022 presidential race.
“Itong si Senator Bong Go, pababa kami sa eroplano, sabi niya na ‘Sir, may hingin sana ako saýo ng pabor.’ Sabi ko, ‘Ano?’ Sabi niya, ‘Medyo, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth, malayo pa pero ikaw na lang ang mag-sabi sa kanila.’ Sabihin ko, ang totoo talaga, isang bagay lang. Sabihin daw sa inyo, gusto niya maging president (Senator Bong Go, when we were about to disembark from the plane, said, ‘Sir, I have a favor to ask.’ I asked him, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘It somehow leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it’s still far but I want you to tell them.’ I will tell you the truth. He wants me to tell you that he wants to be president),” Duterte said, drawing cheers from the crowd.
It was, however, unclear whether he was serious when he made the remarks.
Go, who joined the event, was seen shaking his head in disapproval.
Duterte’s latest statement came despite Go’s insistence that he is not gunning for the presidency in 2022.
It also came amid calls for Go and Duterte to run for president and vice president, respectively.
Earlier Thursday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque recalled Duterte’s previous statement that the Chief Executive has no plan to become the country’s next vice president next year.
Sal Panelo as ‘good senator someday’
Meanwhile, Duterte also hinted at the possibility that his top lawyer, Chief Presidential Legal Counsel, might seek a seat at the Senate in the 2022 national and local elections.
This was after Duterte alluded that Panelo could be a “good senator” in the future.
He also praised Panelo’s credentials, noting that the Palace official’s former clients include celebrities.
“Sal Panelo is the lawyer. Ito ‘yung abugado ng mga artista. Totoo, ‘yung mga iskandalo, nag-aaway. Kaniya iyang lahat. High profile itong si Sal (He is the lawyer of the stars. That’s true, he defended those involved in scandals. That’s him. Sal is high-profile). And maybe, he would make a good senator someday,” Duterte said.
Apart from Panelo, the President also lauded some of his Cabinet officials, including Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade and Public Works Secretary Mark Villar.
A February 4 article published by the local news site firm Politiko said Duterte named nine of his Cabinet secretaries as the administration’s potential senatorial bets next year.
Duterte, Politiko reported, named Roque, Panelo, Tugade, Villar, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. as his senatorial candidates. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

LEGAZPI CITY – The Department of Health (DOH) in Bicol urged the provincial health institutions and local government units (LGUs) in the region to conduct simulation exercises (SIMEX) for the vaccination procedure as a requirement for vaccine allocation.
This, after 22,000 doses in 2,200 vials of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived here on Wednesday.
Dr. John Ferchito Avelino, DOH-Bicol assistant regional director, in a press conference said SIMEX must be conducted to ensure and assess the preparation of people, venue and facilities to be used when the actual vaccines arrive.
""LGUs and hospital must prepare facilities, vaccination workforce, referral facility for adverse effects, and list of eligible individuals to be vaccinated in the localities. DOH will also look into the venue lay-out, process and contingency plan just in case for adverse events like brownout, earthquake and other natural calamities,"" Avelino said.
He also reminded LGUs to coordinate with the DOH for the conduct of the SIMEX in their areas.
Based on DOH-Bicol data, four LGUs in Bicol have conducted SIMEX. These are the provincial governments of Sorsogon, Camarines Sur and Catanduanes and city government of Legazpi for Albay.
""Masbate will conduct (SIMEX) on March 12 and Camarines Norte will be on next Monday,"" Avelino said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Rita Ang-Bon, DOH-Bicol vaccination program coordinator, said the new batch of vaccines that arrived is intended for government hospital healthcare workers in various LGUs that have submitted the requirements based on the DOH deployment criteria.
Ang-Bon said the deployment protocols include availability of storage facility, and list of referral facilities and vaccine recipients including a pre-assessment study that determines who are willing to be vaccinated, health workers who wanted to be inoculated but are ineligible because they are senior citizens, and those who are suffering from comorbidities.
When asked about the deployment of the AstraZeneca vaccines, she said they could not yet determine the allocation per province as they are still waiting for the list from the Covid-19 referral hospitals across the region.
Noemi Bron, DOH public affairs chief, said the arrival of the vaccines contained in three cooler boxes was supervised by medical staff of the agency who immediately transferred the cargo to a waiting refrigerated cargo van at the airport tarmac.
A convoy of police and health workers transported the cargo to the DOH storage facility here for inventory and safekeeping.
The new delivery is part of the 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca that arrived last week in Manila from COVAX, the global vaccine pool recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
A vial of the AstraZeneca vaccine developed by the Oxford University can inoculate 10 people with an efficacy rate of 62-90 percent.
Bicol Region earlier received 12,000 doses of CoronaVac vaccines developed by Beijing-based Sinovac pharmaceutical firm.
The vaccination procedure using the medicines from China started on Wednesday in three government-run hospitals in Sorsogon province that received an initial 960 single-dose vials of Sinovac.
Bron said the initial allocation delivered to Sorsogon was intended for government health workers at the Sorsogon Provincial Hospital, Metro Health Specialist Inc., and Sorsogon Medical Mission Group Hospital and Health Services Cooperative.
The vaccine rollout was conducted after the three hospitals completed their vaccine simulation procedures. (PNA)

As of Thursday, City Administrator Em Ang, executive director of the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), said five out of the seven hospitals here have requested additional vaccines.
“This is kind of good news. This means there is more vaccine acceptance. There is an increase in the interest and intent of our health workers in hospitals to get vaccinated. Perhaps they have seen the examples of those who were vaccinated in the past few days,” Ang said in a radio interview.
She added that the city government will request for additional allocation from the Department of Health to be distributed to the hospitals.
On March 5, some 6,300 vials of the Sinovac vaccine arrived for two Covid-19 referral hospitals in this city - the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital and Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (Riverside Medical Center).

“I am very fortunate that it was the governor who gave the first shot of vaccine to me,” he said.

MANILA – The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) on Wednesday reported that almost 500,000 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who were displaced by the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic have been assisted by the government and are now in their home provinces.
“As of March 10, we have 470,000 OFWs. It is approaching the half a million mark of those that we have sent to their home regions by the OWWA and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and it is also an inter-agency effort,” OWWA administrator Hans Leo Cacdac said in a virtual forum.
Cacdac also said the government continues to provide assistance to returning OFWs which include free swab testing, food and accommodation, and transportation to their home regions.
“Upon orders of the President, swab testing or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing of arriving OFW is free, the quarantine hotel facility including food is also free and also the transportation to their home regions,” he added.
At the same time, Cacdac also reported that at present, there are some 10,000 OFWs that are in 150 hotel facilities, who are waiting for their scheduled transportation back to their provinces.
He said the government is spending PHP30,000 a day, based on the estimated maximum cost of hotel accommodation per night at PHP3,000.
“I will give you an estimate, the maximum cost per night in a hotel is around PHP3,000. It could be less depending on the classification of the hotel. If it’s five-star, maximum of PHP3,000 per night and then if lesser degree than five-star, less than PHP3,000, and then we have around 10,000 OFWs right now. So our projected daily cost is PHP3,000 times 10,000,” the OWWA head added.
Cacdac said the figure only covers the accommodation and does not include the food and transportation expenses.
“It does not include food and transportation. It’s only for hotel accommodations. Of course, included in the hotel accommodations, the food while they are there. There are other food costs, for example, if they have been transported to the airport they will be provided with food. If they will be brought to the bus terminal, they will be given food,” he added.
Cacdac, however, said they cannot give an estimate on how many more OFWs are expected to return to the country.
“It’s difficult to say since the situation right now is fluid because of the vaccine. That will depend on the extent and the efficacy of the vaccination program of countries worldwide, so I want to say 80,000 to 100,000 in the course of the year but I think that is dependent on how the vaccination program of the whole world. The computation for this year will change because of the vaccination phenomenon,"" he added.

MANILA – Navotas Mayor Toby Tiangco reminded his constituents anew that wearing face masks at all times outside their home would help contain the community transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

Department of the Interior and Local Government Officer-in-Charge Bernardo C. Florece Jr. earlier directed Joint Task Force Shield Commander, Lt. Gen. Cesar Hawthorne Binag, to increase police deployment and strictly enforce minimum public health standards in Navotas, Pasay, Malabon, Cebu City, and Cebu province, which have recently registered a spike in Covid-19 infections.
Tiangco said the city government has been receiving numerous complaints on the improper wearing of face masks and violation of curfew hours among minors in Navotas.
He ordered barangay officials to strictly implement Covid-19 protocols in their respective villages.
""Gusto po nating manatiling ligtas ang bawat mamamayan kaya hinihingi po namin ang inyong pakikiisa (We want to keep our residents safe from Covid-19, that's why we are appealing for your cooperation),"" Tiangco told his constituents.
He said residents should not disregard the prevailing threat of Covid-19.
The city government on Tuesday issued a memorandum order to implement a three-strike policy on flagging down violators of health protocols amid the pandemic.
The memorandum stated that the three-strike policy would be enforced in a barangay ""if the Task Force Disiplina or the Philippine National Police (PNP) is able to flag down more violators in a particular barangay than the barangay authorities themselves.”
“If this occurs three times, the undersigned (Tiangco) shall refer the gross neglect of duty on the part of the barangay to strictly implement existing ordinances of the City to the Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council),” the order read.

Last week, the initial delivery of 17, 940, and 4,200 vials of the China-made Sinovac vaccines also arrived here for health workers in both regions.

Andrew Morris, the chief of the United Children’s Fund–Mindanao field office, said the COVAX Facility is an international partnership established to ensure equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines around the world.

The Philippines is among the first countries in Southeast Asia to receive vaccines from the COVAX Facility.

Meanwhile, Bangsamoro Grand Mufti Abuhuraira Udasan issued a religious guideline dated March 6 emphasizing that vaccines are for healing and are generally lawful as a preventive measure.

“On the issue of the anti-Covid-19 vaccine, it is the Health Authority that has the final decision whether it is safe to get vaccinated or not,” Udasan said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo on Wednesday expressed confidence that the “three-pronged strategy” crafted by the country’s economic team would generate more job opportunities in the country.
“Para mapabilis ‘yung ating pagbabalik sa dati nating malusog na ekonomiya at yung pagbabalik sa mga trabaho, ‘yung ating mga economic managers ay merong sinasabing tatlong istratehiya (To restore our robust economy and create more jobs, our economic managers have three strategies),” Panelo said in his commentary show “Counterpoint”.
About four million adult Filipinos were left jobless in January this year despite the gradual reopening of the Philippine economy amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.
Unemployment worsened to 8.7 percent in January from 5.3 percent in the same month last year, according to the preliminary results of the Philippine Statistics Authority’s labor force survey released on Tuesday.
Panelo said further easing of restrictions amid the pandemic would allow more people to return to work.
“Ang ating bansa ngayon ay dahan-dahang bumabalik na kahit may pandemya sapagkat yung mga nawawalan ng trabaho, dahan-dahan na nagkakaroon, nakukuha muli ang mga trabaho nila (Despite the pandemic, our country is gradually returning to normalcy because those who lost their jobs are now able to return to work),” he said.
To address unemployment, Panelo said the country’s economic managers have come up with strategies to accelerate job creation.
These strategies, he said, are the safe reopening of the economy, the full implementation of the recovery package, and the timely implementation of the Covid-19 vaccine program.
Citing the latest labor force survey data released by the National Economic and Development Authority, Panelo noted that about 1.4 million jobs lost due to the pandemic have been restored.
He added that the unemployment rate decreased from 12.4 percent to 8.8 percent last January.
“‘Yung mga employer natin ay talagang hinahanapan ng paraan upang ma-handle nila ‘yung krisis ng maayos at pati na yung negosyo nila, matulungan ang mga empleyado nila sa kanilang mga trabaho at makaahon (The employers in the country are looking for ways to handle the crisis and save their businesses, as well as help their employees recover),” Panelo said.
He also cited the Salary Budget Planning Report of global advisory, broking, and solutions firm Willis Towers Watson, which revealed that workers in the Philippines are projected to have an average increase of 5.6 percent in their salary this year.
“Kahit may pandemya (Even if there’s a pandemic), there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel,” Panelo said. “So when you’re down, there’s no other way but up.” (PNA)

MANILA – Health experts on Wednesday clarified that getting a vaccine passport after having been inoculated is not a guarantee that an individual will not spread or get infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) anymore.
In a Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday, Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, a member of the Department of Health’s (DOH) Technical Advisory Group, said vaccine passports will merely serve as a record that an individual has been vaccinated.
“Hindi 'yung kapag nakapagbigay proof ka na nabakunahan ka na eh hindi ka na manghahawa at hindi ka (na) mahahawaan. And in fact, wala pa tayo ganun klaseng information (It won’t be because you already have proof that you’re vaccinated that you cannot infect or get infected. In fact, we don’t have that kind of information yet),” Lim said.
She noted that vaccinated individuals are expected to benefit from a decrease in the severity of Covid-19 symptoms and that there is no information yet on whether vaccination will decrease transmission of the disease.
“Kahit na nabakunahan na, ang mga healthcare workers pinag-iingat pa rin ang lahat kasi yun ngang paglipat ng sakit, whether mahawaan or manghawa, ay hindi kasama dun sa datos na hawak natin sa ngayon (Even after inoculation, our health workers are still being cautioned because the transmission of the disease is not included in the data that we have right now),” Lim said.
Dr. John Wong, a member of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infections Diseases–Technical Working Group on Data Analytics, said vaccine passports will be required mostly by businesses such as airline companies before allowing people inside their establishments.
However, he said, “it will take a while before the Philippines reaches that stage, where we'll be able to say somebody with a vaccination passport will not be able to transmit, that it will be safe.” 
The spread of new variants
Meanwhile, Wong said the Philippine Genome Center has detected “several cases” of both the UK and South Africa variant of the virus that causes Covid-19, noting that the UK-variant was known to have increased transmissibility while the South Africa-variant is supposed to be resistant against vaccines.
He said the current surge of new cases of Covid-19 in the country may be caused by the UK-variant.
If over half of all cases in the National Capital Region (NCR) gets infected with the UK-variant, he said there may be an increase of “nine times more cases after a month.”
“So, we have to take precautions to avoid this,” Wong said.
On Tuesday, the DOH reported 2,668 new infections of Covid-19, with active cases totaling 41,822 or 7 percent of all infections since the pandemic hit the country back in 2020. (PNA)

MANILA – More and more health workers are getting vaccinated with the CoronaVac and AstraZeneca vaccines, with a health expert noting that the availability of the second brand of a vaccine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has encouraged more vaccinations.
In a Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday, Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, a member of the Department of Health’s (DOH) Technical Advisory Group, said the vaccination drive among health workers have so far received a good response, noting that those apprehensive about CoronaVac’s “low” efficacy for preventing mild symptoms have been encouraged with the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines.
“Dahil nagkaroon na ng ibang options, mas marami din nagkaroon ng encouragement na magpabakuna (Because of the addition of another option, more have been encouraged to get vaccinated),” Lim said.
However, she emphasized the importance of receiving any of the vaccines if they fit the criteria for inoculation.
“As long as nagpi-fit tayo sa criteria kung saan siya dapat gamitin magpabakuna na tayo kasi dagdag proteksyon talaga ‘to (As long as we fit the criteria on how it must be used then we should get vaccinated because this is increased protection),” Lim said.
Following reports of a decrease in efficacy of vaccines for other variants of the virus that causes the Covid-19, she said less protection is still better than having no protection at all.
“Kahit anong bakuna pa ang matanggap mo, kahit sabihin pa natin na medyo bumaba ang bisa niyan, meron pa rin kesa sa zero kung hindi ka nagpabakuna (Whatever vaccine you receive, even if it’s found that its efficacy lessened, it is still better than no protection at all if you don’t get inoculated),” Lim said.
Getting vaccinated, she said, is expected to decrease the severity of Covid-19 infections, noting that there is no information yet on whether vaccinations decrease transmission of the disease.
“Kahit na nabakunahan na, ang mga healthcare workers pinag-iingat pa rin ang lahat kasi yun ngang paglipat ng sakit, whether mahawaan or manghawa, ay hindi kasama dun sa datos na hawak natin sa ngayon (Even after inoculation, our health workers are still being cautioned because the transmission of the disease is not included in the data that we have right now),” Lim said.

MANILA – The government aims to start the vaccination of the general public as soon as the inoculation program for healthcare workers and senior citizens will be finished by the middle of this year, a National Task Force Against Covid-19 (NTF) official said.
 During the Laging Handa briefing Wednesday, NTF deputy chief implementer Vivencio Dizon said the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) immunization program for the general public will be done in time for the arrival of more vaccines that the government ordered from various vaccine makers.
 “Our objective is by mid-year we’re done inoculating our health care workers and senior citizens. That’s in time with the arrival of Moderna and other vaccines, then we can start the vaccination for the general public,” Dizon said in Filipino.
 He added that next to healthcare workers and senior citizens, the priority sectors for the Covid-19 vaccines are those with comorbidities, non-medical front-liners like police, economic front-liners including public transportation drivers and wet market vendors, and indigent population.
 To date, the Philippines received a total of 1,125,600 doses of Covid-19 vaccines -- 600,000 Sinovac’s CoronaVac were donated by the Chinese government and 525,600 AstraZeneca vaccines were from the COVAX Facility that arrived in two batches.
 “Of the 1.1 million doses that arrived, more than half or around 60 percent were distributed and deployed,” Dizon said adding the remaining vials are continuously being given to healthcare workers across the country.
 Dizon said they are hopeful to receive more than 2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines this month.
 Of the expected 2 million doses that will arrive this month, 1.4 million vials are from Sinovac -- 400,000 are the additional donation from China and 1 million doses are ordered by the Philippine government.
 “The World Health Organization committed that the next tranches of AstraZeneca from COVAX Facility are going to arrive. So we hope to receive more than the 1.4 million Sinovac this March. Hopefully, we will reach more than 2 million this March,” Dizon said in Filipino.
 Moreover, Dizon said the NTF will look into doing two to three shifts a day for vaccine administrators once the inoculation program for the general public will start to fast-track the rollout of Covid-19 immunization program.
 He added the government will be able to reach its target of inoculating 50 million Filipinos by the end of 2021 as long as the significant amount of vaccine supply will arrive within the year. (PNA)

 Lim said a simulation activity would be held Wednesday in preparation for the start of inoculation of more than 1,000 health care workers.
 “The good thing with Sinovac, it is not that sensitive. With regards to storage, it only requires 2 (degrees) to 8 degrees, which is a normal refrigerator temperature, plus new reports are coming out that it is also effective against new variants,” he said.
 The Department of Health - Center for Health and Development (DOH-CHD) 1 (Ilocos region) turned over on Tuesday some 2,171 doses of the Sinovac vaccine, CoronaVac. 
 “We thank Dr. Valeriano Lopez, DOH-CHD-1 director, (Health) Secretary (Francisco) Duque, and the Inter-Agency Task Force representatives for helping us.

Dr. Rochelle Oco, acting head of the City Health Office, said the local government has sent letters of intent to at least two foreign drug companies for the purchase of their approved vaccines for the disease.
She said these efforts are being facilitated by the League of Cities of the Philippines, in which City Mayor Ronnel Rivera sits as the national vice-chairperson. The mayor is a member of the group’s committee on vaccine availment.
Oco said the city specifically ordered 160,000 shots each for the first dose and the same number for the second dose from British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and the American Novavax Inc.
The Food and Drug Administration has already issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the AstraZeneca vaccine and is working on issuing the same for Novavax, which is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.
“This will cover roughly 300,000 eligible residents,” she said in the question hour during the city council’s regular session on Tuesday.
Rivera earlier announced that the local government has allocated around PHP200 million for the purchase of the vaccines and their rollout.
Oco said the vaccines alone will cost around PHP125 million based on the projection of the City Budget Office.
She said that based on the current global trend on the availability of the Covid-19 vaccines, the delivery could start by the third quarter of the year.
The official said the vaccines that will be purchased by the city will augment the supplies that would be allotted by the national government, which has yet to release the specific figures.
She said they expect that the combined vaccine supplies would be enough to cover at least 70 percent of the city’s over 700,000 population to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19.
Citing the Department of Health guidelines, she said the priority for the vaccination rollout will be the health care workers, senior citizens, indigent residents as well as military, police, and other security and law enforcement personnel who are aged 18 to 65-years-old.
The vaccination of the priority health care workers in the city started last Monday (March 8), using the Sinovac vaccines donated by the Chinese government.
A total of 3,138 medical professionals and staff members of six referral hospitals here for Covid-19 patients are eligible to get the vaccines until the end of the inoculation period on March 14. (PNA)

Share",Zorayda Tecson,"March 9, 2021, 7:38 pm","CITY OF SAN FERNANDO, Pampanga – The city government here is urging residents to trust the government-approved vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
Mayor Edwin Santiago made the call to ease the apprehensions of some people in getting anti-Covid-19 shots once they are available.
“Bigyan po natin ng tiwala ang bakuna at ang pamahalaan po natin na ginagawa ang lahat para bigyan tayo ng panlaban sa sakit (Let us trust the vaccines and our government that is doing all efforts to give us resistance to disease),” Santiago said in a statement on Tuesday.
He thanked the national government for including the province of Pampanga in the priority list for the vaccination rollout program.
Some 400 healthcare workers of the Jose B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital (JBLMGH) in this city received anti-Covid-19 vaccines on Monday.
The Central Luzon Center for Health Development (CLCHD) allocated more than 4,000 Sinovac vaccines for the healthcare community in the province and JBLMGH as the priority.
Dr. Montserrat S. Chichioco, chief of the JBLMGH, allayed the public's fear of the vaccines.
“Hindi po siya masakit at mapanganib tulad ng sabi-sabi. Ang importante lang po sa bakuna ay kaalaman at huwag maniwala sa sabi-sabi lang. We base it on Science. Huwag matakot sa bakuna dahil lahat po ng bakuna iisa lang ang goal nyan—ang-ma prevent ang pag-spread ng infection, ma-prevent po yung severe infection and of course ma-prevent po yung death (It is not as painful and dangerous as what others say. The only important thing about the vaccine is knowledge and don't believe in hearsay. We based it on science. Don't be afraid of the vaccine because all vaccines have the same goal — to prevent the spread of infection, to prevent severe infection and of course to prevent death),” Chichioco said.
Chichioco was the first healthcare worker in the province to be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine.
He said there will be 3,247 additional vaccines that will arrive in the province within this week. On March 6, a total of 846 vials of Sinovac vaccines were delivered to the JBLMGH.
“It not less than 4,000 po yung naka-allocate sa atin (were allocated to us). So, we hope to inoculate at least 30 percent of healthcare workers in the entire province depending sa allocation,” he said.
Meanwhile, Santiago assured Fernandinos that the vaccine will be administered to the priority groups — healthcare workers and front-liners first, then senior citizens, down to the general population.
The city government has realigned the responsibilities of its Covid-19 Local Task Force to focus on the rollout of the vaccination program.
It also started its Covid-19 vaccination survey through paper-and-pen and online procedures with the use of QR (Quick Response) Code and electronic immunization registry.

ILOILO CITY – To open Boracay Island including to international tourists, the industry players on the island need to be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
In a press conference Tuesday, Aklan Governor Florencio Miraflores said he requested last month for 40,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines from the national Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the economic sector, which is the tourism sector.
He made the advance request, as the tourism sector, just like other leading industries, significantly contributes to the national economy.
Miraflores said the tourism sector has a huge contribution to the country’s gross domestic product, (GDP) amounting to PHP56 billion as of last count.
“To revive the economy, it is very important that the tourism sector should also be revived,” he said in a press conference streamed at the Facebook page of the Kalibo Cable TV Network Inc.
However, the provision of vaccines prioritizes the health sector and the elderly. Once they are done, then the distribution will go by sectors already, he added.
“But we are hoping that the 40,000 doses that we requested for Boracay will be prioritized also by the national government,” he said.
The governor expressed confidence that the government will prioritize Boracay once the tourism sector is already on the list of recipients.
“Once they get vaccinated in Boracay, we will open up Boracay to the world, not only to domestic tourists but to the rest of the world,” he said.
On Tuesday, the province of Aklan received its 2,420 vials of the Sinovac vaccine from the Department of Health Western Visayas Center for Health Development (DOH WV CHD).
Bulk of the vaccines will go to the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbukon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) with 920 vials.
Dr. Myla Bernabe, who represented the DOH WV CHD, said the vaccines already covered health workers from the province’s district, municipal and private hospitals. They are also assured of their second dose sometime next month, or after 28 days.
“We are assured that all our hospital health workers will be protected by the vaccine. As mentioned, AstraZeneca is also coming but is limited to the senior citizen health workers,” he said.
He added that according to experts, the Sinovac vaccine is 50 percent effective for mild cases, 57 percent for moderate cases, and 100 percent for severe cases that could lead to death.
The rollout on March 10 will be covered by cable stations in Kalibo for the public to witness and boost their confidence in the Sinovac vaccine, he said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

BACOLOD CITY – Residents of this city are enjoined anew to register for vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) as medical front-liners who took the initial shots of Sinovac’s CoronaVac have been doing well days after they were vaccinated.
Dr. Edwin Miraflor, officer-in-charge of the City Health Office, said on Tuesday that since life is at stake, the best vaccine is the one readily available.
“We have already seen our medical practitioners avail of the Sinovac vaccine and so far, since March 5, we have not received any adverse reaction,” Miraflor told the Philippine News Agency.
He pointed out that “without prejudice to any race or nationality, Sinovac is one of the top vaccine manufacturers in China”, utilizing the traditional method of vaccine preparation.
“It is not like the replica gadgets and other peripherals sold wherever that we fear may be compromised. Sinovac’s CoronaVac has undergone clinical trials and in fact, has been used in other Asian countries,” he added.
On March 5, Miraflor administered the first shot here of CoronaVac on Dr. Miguel Sarabia, president of the Negros Occidental Medical Society, in a ceremonial vaccination held at the Bacolod Government Center, a couple of hours after the Sinovac vaccines arrived in the city.
Two Covid-19 referral hospitals here, including the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH) and the Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (DPOTMH), held a ceremonial vaccination in separate rites held on Monday.
“We hope this message resonates down to the community that more of you will now agree to get vaccinated. More than this, I hope that our people will greatly realize that the development and approval of safe and effective vaccine less than a year after the emergence of a new virus is a stunning scientific achievement and a much-needed source of hope,” Miraflor, who represented Mayor Evelio Leonardia at the DPOTMH event, said.
Dr. Jose Pepito Malapitan, acting assistant medical director of DPOTMH, said it is best that medical front-liners can show that they are willing to get vaccinated themselves to give the people courage to also avail themselves of the vaccine.
“Right now, I feel nothing, but we have to be observed and we have to report anything that we might feel for 24 hours. So far even in studies, there are only a few who had any reaction,” Malapitan said after taking the first shot.
In Bacolod, residents willing to be vaccinated can register online through tinyurl.com/bcdceironline and tinyurl.com/bcdceirbrgy.
As of March 8, Bacolod has no new case and death. Of the 5,847 confirmed cases in the city, 5,589 have recovered. There are still 70 active cases and 188 deaths. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – Further reopening of the domestic economy and easing of movement restrictions are seen to help address the country’s unemployment rate, which stood at 8.7 percent in January 2021. 
 Economists expect the unemployment rate to remain around this level until next year given the impact of the pandemic on businesses and the job market. 
 In a report, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said the latest unemployment figure “still reflects the relatively slower pace of economic recovery despite the Christmas season that just passed, as Metro Manila remained under GCQ (general community quarantine) since June 2020.” 
 “Thus, further reopening of the economy would provide a structural and more sustainable solution in terms of increased production, sales, incomes/livelihood that also create/entail more employment/jobs and more working hours,” he said. 
 Ricafort said the proposed shift to modified GCQ (MGCQ) alongside the easing of travel restrictions and those being implemented for public transportation “would help create more employment/jobs and help further lower unemployment and underemployment.”
 An additional plus to this factor is the higher government spending on infrastructure and the election-related spending for next year’s national polls.
 He added, “the proposed MGCQ nationwide and any other additional measures to reopen the economy would be a function of additional Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine arrivals and rollouts as well as any reduction in new Covid-19 local cases.”
 ING Bank Manila senior economist Nicholas Mapa said the pandemic and its resulting economic scarring is now taking root as shown by the unemployment rate. 
 He said despite the easing of movement restrictions, “the labor market remains just as challenged with the latest unemployment rate.”
 “This translates to four million Filipinos without a job which will likely complicate the expected pickup in consumer spending should the government’s wish to move to MGCQ be granted,” he added.
 Mapa said the rise of unemployment and underemployment, which rose to 16 percent last January from 14.4 percent in the last quarter of 2020, “point to subdued access to income and likely muted purchasing power, now all the more problematic given the rise in inflation.”
 “The high level of unemployment will be around even if we relax quarantine measures as the scarring effects of closed businesses and jobs lost become more entrenched and the economy slowly spirals into lower levels of GDP (gross domestic product),” he added. (PNA)

CEBU CITY – Inoculation against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) of medical front-liners in the private sector in Cebu has started on Tuesday.
A total of 9,000 health workers from eight private hospitals in the province are lined up for the vaccination rollout, as the Department of Health (DOH) expanded the inoculation drive to non-government centers.
DOH-7 chief pathologist Dr. Mary Jean Loreche said the healthcare workers (HCWs) from level 1 and 2 non-government hospitals are likewise scheduled for inoculation using the CoronaVac jabs from China’s Sinovac Biotech company.
Loreche said 2,468 doses of CoronaVac vaccines have been allocated to Chong Hua Hospital-Fuente; 1,585 doses for Cebu Doctors’ University Hospital; 1,200 for Perpetual Succor Hospital; 1,111 doses for Chong Hua Hospital-Mandaue; 414 doses for Cebu South General Hospital; 364 doses for Cebu North General Hospital; and 560 doses for Mactan Doctor’s Hospital.
These hospitals simultaneously administered Tuesday the China-made vaccines to their medical workers.
Loreche said the University of Cebu Medical Center (UCMed) has an allocation of 1,230 doses. However, the DOH Sinovac jabs are yet to be delivered pending inspection of their cold chain facility.
Perpetual Succor Hospital vaccination point-person, Dr. Elrey Inocian, told the media that they targeted to inoculate 600 of the 1,107 HCWs in this private hospital run by a Roman Catholic congregation of the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres.
With 120 vaccinees per day, Inocian said they expect to finish the inoculation in five days. 
“Most of them who come today for vaccination are off from their duty. We give them the freedom to choose a day in time that they do not have work so that they can rest after the inoculation,” Inocian said in Cebuano.
The hospital established a hotline for adverse reactions from the vaccine, he said, adding that each vaccinee has been given a three-hour observation period after the inoculation to monitor any adverse reactions.
Inocian said the vaccinees would get the second dose within 28 days “in order to reach the efficacy rate of 98 percent” of the CoronaVac jabs.
Aside from Perpetual Succor Hospital, other hospitals that simultaneously administered CoronaVac to their medical employees are the Cebu Doctors’ Hospital Group and Chong Hua Hospital.
Cebu Doctors’ Hospital Group owner, Dr. Potenciano Larrazabal III, was among the hundreds of front-liners who took the CoronaVac jabs on Tuesday.
Larrazabal, a well-known eye specialist, said getting any available vaccine would help the population to achieve immunity against coronavirus disease.
“The pandemic is getting closer and closer to us. I believe it is just a matter of days that our loved ones or staff may get infected. So vaccination is the way to go if we want to attain herd immunity. That is why I advise our family - the CebuDoc Group to please join this activity. I believe the best vaccine is the first vaccine on hand, and I am here to prove that as I receive the first vaccine today,” Larrazabal said in a statement posted on social media.
He said the mass vaccination in Cebu is “just the start of the end of the long tunnel we have been taking this past year”. (With report from Carlo Lorenciana/PNA)

MANILA – The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on Tuesday said it is optimistic that employment in the country will continue to improve in the coming months with the availability of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
“We expect a better and more improved employment performance in the coming months with the vaccine being made available and more Filipinos under the priority categories getting inoculated,” Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said in a statement.
At the same time, he added that the positive numbers in the country’s labor force show that companies and employees are gaining confidence with the slowly reopening of the economy.
“The results of the January 2021 Labor Force Survey is highly encouraging with a 1.6 million increase in the country’s labor force, and 1.4 million workers who had regained employment,” he added.
Bello also said the improvement in the country's employment situation shows that businesses and workers are starting to regain confidence with the safe reopening of the economy,” he added.
According to Bello, the numbers involved are October 2020 as against the January 2021 figures.
“The improvement in figures being referred to is January 2021 versus October 2020 where there is an increase in the labor force participation rate at 60.5 percent (45.2 million) from 58.7 percent (43.6 million) or an increase of 1.6 million economically active joining the labor force. Meanwhile, employed persons increased by 1.4 million in January 2021 (41.2 million) compared to 39.8 million in October 2020,” he added.
Bello also called on workers and businesses to continue the strict implementation of the minimum public health standards (MPHS), and occupational safety and health policies.
“With the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the past week, we need to instill discipline in adhering to basic MPHS -- the proper wearing of face mask and face shield, washing of hands, social distancing,” he said.
He said the country cannot afford to implement another hard lockdown which would mean losses of jobs and livelihood.
Bello said the Task Group on Economic Recovery (TGER) and the National Employment Recovery Strategy (NERS) Task Force are doubling their efforts to achieve economic rebound and sustained labor market improvement in the new normal.
“The country’s recovery goal is to safely reopen the economy, bring back more workers in their jobs, and preserve and generate more employment for the Filipinos here and abroad,” he added. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

DAGUPAN CITY – Most of the healthcare workers in Region 1 Medical Center (R1MC) here who were vaccinated with the first batch of Sinovac vaccines said they got it to protect themselves, the patients, and their families.
 ""I feel privileged and happy to be one of the recipients of Sinovac vaccine. This is for my family, my patients. Thank you DOH (Department of Health), thank you R1MC,"" said Dr. Agnes Dimaano, a medical specialist from the Department of Pediatrics in R1MC.
 Dimaano was the first to be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine in Pangasinan and in the entire Ilocos Region.
 ""I am so happy being vaccinated. I expose myself daily with Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with my mask and face shield as my only protection.

 Dr. John Fernandez, a pediatric intensivist, said he chose to be vaccinated as he believed it would help him better protect his family, his critically-ill pediatric patients, his co-workers, and his own health.
 The vaccine acceptability among frontline health workers in the eight referral hospitals in the Ilocos Region, including R1MC, is increasing amid the arrival of doses of vaccines in the region, according to DOH Center for Health and Development Ilocos regional office (DOH-CHD-1) information officer Dr. Rheuel Bobis.
 In an interview on Tuesday, Bobis said that from the 41-percent acceptability prior to the arrival of the vaccines, the percentage of health workers who want to be inoculated is increasing daily.
 “They are excited for the vaccines as this is a big step in getting immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). They are also glad as they now have a new weapon against the virus,” he said.
 On Monday night, some 25,600 doses of both Sinovac and Astrazeneca vaccines arrived at the DOH-CHD-1 office here.
 Bobis said the 10,000 doses of Astrazeneca vaccines will be given to the frontline medical workers aged 60 and above in the eight referral hospitals in the region, while the 14,400 Sinovac vaccines will be distributed to the medical workers both in public and private hospitals in the region catering to Covid-19 patients.
 “We will prioritize with Astrazeneca vaccines the senior citizen medical workers who have direct exposure to Covid-19 patients in the eight referral hospitals since Sinovac is prohibited to senior citizens. The new batch of Sinovac vaccines will be distributed today to the Provincial Health Office of La Union and Lorma Medical Center and other private and district hospitals in La Union, Ilocos Norte, and Dagupan City and tomorrow at Ilocos Sur and Pangasinan,” he added.
 The 1,200 doses, Bobis said, are allocated for the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Naval Forces Northern Luzon.
 “It is part of the 100,000 Sinovac vaccine allocation of the Department of National Defense,” he said.
 Bobis also attributed the increasing vaccine acceptability among medical front-liners in the eight referral hospitals to the effects of the vaccine to the first batch of workers inoculated.
 Out of the over 2,000 frontline health workers inoculated with Sinovac vaccine as of Monday, only seven of them experienced minor side effects that are common and not life-threatening, he said.
 “On the fourth day of our vaccination with Sinovac among health workers in the eight coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) referral hospitals in the region, seven health workers experienced respectively, the heaviness of the arm, redness and or irritation in the area vaccinated, and one with fever,” he added.
 Bobis said these side effects are expected to go away in a couple of days. (PNA)

(PNA photo by Richelyn Gubalani) 
GENERAL SANTOS CITY – Two elderly practicing doctors have availed of the Sinovac vaccines in the first two days of inoculation for priority frontline health care workers here, an official said on Tuesday.
Dr. Ryan Aplicador, deputy incident commander of the City Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, said Dr. Wilfredo Garcia, 70, and Dr. Benjamin Pagarigan Jr., 69, were vaccinated with their first doses on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
He said the two, who are still serving at the local government-run Dr. Jorge P. Royeca Hospital (DJPRH), volunteered to get the CoronaVac, the vaccine’s trade name, despite being properly informed that it was not recommended for them due to lack of clinical trials.
The Department of Health (DOH) only recommended the vaccine to individuals aged 18 to 59 years old based on its “higher efficacy” rate.
But, Aplicador said the two doctors signed waivers that they want to receive the CoronaVac vaccine and submitted clearances from their personal doctors.
Aside from them, he said several health workers who have diabetes and hypertension were vaccinated after passing the mandatory screening.
“As of now, they are all in good condition and did not experience any adverse side effects,” Aplicador told reporters.
Pagarigan, a former chief of the DJPRH, said he has full confidence that the CoronaVac will give him enough protection against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
“At my age, I can’t risk that. I’ll do this anytime even without a waiver,” he told PNA before getting the vaccine.
He is hoping that their decision would inspire and encourage other health workers to get vaccinated early against the disease.
On the first day of inoculation, some 84 of DJPRH’s 549 active personnel were given the CoronaVac vaccine.
Aplicador said that from the initial 40 percent who signified and gave their consent to be vaccinated before the rollout, the number has so far increased to about 50 percent.
“We’re expecting that more will come forward until the (March 14) deadline,” he said.
DOH-12 delivered last Saturday a total of 3,138 vials of the CoronaVac vaccine for the first dose of priority health care workers from six Covid-19 referral hospitals in the city.
These are the DJPRH, St. Elizabeth Hospital Inc.(SEHI), General Santos Doctor’s Hospital, Socsargen County Hospital (SCH), Mindanao Medical Center, and GenSan Medical Center.
Partial data showed that 100 workers of SEHI and 61 from SCH received the vaccines on Monday.
Citing the DOH’s guidelines, Aplicador said the unused vials will be returned to the agency’s main hub in Cotabato City after the end of the seven-day vaccination period.
He added that the second dose or booster shots of the recipients will be administered on April 5. (PNA)

BACOLOD CITY – Two of the physicians who took the initial shots of Sinovac’s CoronaVac at the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH) here on Monday said they had themselves vaccinated not only to protect themselves but their families and patients as well.
The CLMMRH kicked off the local vaccination program with the inoculation of an initial nine medical and administrative front-liners inside the hospital’s emerging infectious disease facility.
Starting Tuesday up to the end of the week, the CLMMRH aims to vaccinate about 150 personnel a day, which would mean utilizing an estimated 800 doses for the initial jabs, which will be followed by the second shots after 28 days, Dr. Julius Drilon, medical center chief of CLMMRH, said.
Dr. Carina Frayco, an infectious diseases specialist (IDS), said it is vital for her work as a medical front-liner to get protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
“As an IDS, I am grateful that I’m able to participate and especially I’m one of the first who received the Sinovac. This is important in my line of work, in my line of duty as a front-liner, and also for my own protection, for my family, and for the whole community,” Frayco said in an interview after taking the first shot.
“Although it will be a long time that we can achieve herd immunity, but I’m happy that step by step, or what we call baby steps, we can achieve our goal to end this pandemic,” she added.
At the CLMMRH, only about 50 percent of the 1,743 hospital staff has consented to avail of Sinovac shots for varying reasons – some are already above 60 years old, some have existing medical conditions, and some are hesitant because of the brand, Frayco said.
“I hope that in the next few days after they will see that I’m okay, that I didn’t experience major side effects, it will encourage healthcare workers to take part in the vaccination program. We should be grateful for what we have now if we want to be protected,” she said.
Dr. Joan Cerrada, planning chief of the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System Covid-19 Response Team, said that having access to the vaccine is a privilege for everyone since it is given for free.
“We don’t have to pay for it, grab the opportunity. We need to develop herd immunity and we can only do that if many of our population is vaccinated. They say, 60 to 70 percent. Let’s help each other, let’s help end this pandemic. Get vaccinated,” she added.
Cerrada, a Gawad Bayaning Kalusugan awardee in the health care and case management of Covid-19 patients in Philippine hospitals, stressed the need for vaccination to have more protection against the deadly virus.
“I need to have myself protected, my family and my patients, and I’m proud of that,” she said.
She urged her fellow healthcare workers to take the vaccine and contribute to the measures that the government and the global community are doing to put an end to the health crisis.
“I have studied all the measures that we need to do to end this pandemic. We have had everything. Social distancing, face shield, face mask, everything but it’s still there. The one that is missing is the vaccination, and that’s what we need to do to have layers of protection against the virus,” she added. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

ILOILO CITY – A journey towards “normalcy” has started with the availability of the vaccine to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and the people can almost claim that they “are about to see the sunrise”.
This was the message of Dr. Joselito Villaruz, president of the West Visayas State University (WVSU) system, as the West Visayas State University Medical Center (WVSUMC) rolled out its vaccination on Monday.
“The development of the vaccine has been considered as man’s greatest discovery which has saved innumerable lives in the history of mankind. This new development is once again a testament that science research and medicine will be our only weapons to ensure human survival,” he said.
Villaruz joined other medical doctors in calling for the eligible population to get inoculated.
“Each one of us must be inoculated. This is the only way. We cannot wait any longer, for today is one golden opportunity that we wouldn’t want to miss. If we are to survive this generation, we must stand united and strong. Keep the negativities and politics behind. We will do this because we love ourselves, our families, and our community,” he said.
WVSUMC officer-in-charge Dr. Dave Endel Gelito III, in his message, said that they have been gifted with “something more than a mask, PPE (personal protective equipment)”. What was given, he said, was a chance to get protected from the virus and “regain freedom from the shackles of Covid-19”.
“As I receive my first dose of Sinovac, I would like to appeal to more of my fellow healthcare workers to avail of this vaccine. With the recent surges in Manila and Cebu, I believe the earlier we get protection, the better for all of us,” he said.
Apart from the WVSUMC, three other Covid-19 referral hospitals in Iloilo namely Western Visayas Medical Center (WVMC), Iloilo Doctor’s Hospital (IDH) and the Iloilo St. Paul’s Hospital also started their vaccination.
On Friday, 18 boxes or more or less 6,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccines arrived in Iloilo. Hours after the arrival, the Iloilo St. Paul’s Hospital held its ceremonial vaccination in preparation for Monday's rollout.
Onboard to monitor the inoculation were members of the Western Visayas Regional Vaccine Operations Center (RVOC) for Covid-19 chaired by Director Emilia P. Monicimpo of the Department of Health and Civil Defense Western Visayas Director Jose Roberto Nuñez who is in charge of the logistics.
Monicimpo, in her message, urged health workers to “grab the opportunity” because other hospitals are waiting to also have their allocation.
“I hope you can increase the number of recipients so we can also cater to others interested to receive Sinovac. The best vaccine right now is the vaccine that is available,” she said.
As of Monday, the hospital targets to cover 163 of its 687 workers who agreed to be vaccinated. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Duterte on Monday night (March 8, 2021) said Robredo caused doubt when she called for a review of Sinovac's CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine by the Health Technology Assessment Council just as the government was boosting public confidence in the vaccines. (Presidential file photo)
MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night said Vice President Leni Robredo’s call for a review of Sinovac's CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) created doubt just as the government was boosting public confidence in the vaccines.
In a pre-recorded public address, Duterte said Robredo did the public a “disservice” by supposedly making it appear that the government was skipping regulatory processes for vaccines.
He insisted that an HTAC review is only recommendatory and is not required before the government can roll out vaccines.
“Ang ginawa niyang disservice to the people is noong hindi niya sinabi na recommendatory (She did a great disservice to the people when she didn’t say that it was recommendatory),” he said.
Duterte said Robredo did not even bother understanding the provision under the Universal Health Care Act or Republic Act also known as Republic Act No. 11223 which states that the HTAC is recommendatory.
The donated Sinovac shots, he said, are not yet required to undergo an HTAC review because these were donated and not procured by the government.
“We were fighting against the tide of non-believers na huwag kayong matakot, ganito (not to be afraid). Now, here comes the statement na hindi niya --- hindi niya binasa kumpleto ang batas (she made without completely reading the law), with just a simple statement, magke-create ka ng (you’re creating) doubt,” he said.
He blamed Robredo’s call for an HTAC review as the reason why more individuals rejected the Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines.
“We were doing everything convincing, spending most of our time convincing the people that it is safe. Ang bakuna is safe. Now, if you create that uncertainty in the minds of the people mas maraming ayaw (there would be more who would refuse to get vaccinated),” he said.
Duterte expressed frustration over how Robredo relied on “half-truths” when she failed to read the UHC law.
“Medyo galit ako (I’m slightly angry) for coming with a half-truth na basahin mo kalahati lang (where you read just half of the law),” he said.
Instead of joining the government’s efforts to promote vaccine confidence, he said Robredo “muddled up everything.”
“I said, creating an uncertainty and doubt in the minds of the people. So ‘yon ang nagalitan ko (So that’s why I’m angry) because we were running against time, kailangan mabakuna na agad (we needed to start vaccination immediately),” he said.
He, meanwhile, appealed to Robredo to stay quiet if she is unsure of her statements.
“I hope that next time kung wala naman siyang masabi na tama (if she can’t say anything right), she just would maybe shut up. Siguraduhin niya muna o hindi magbasa siya, siya mismo. Ikaw, ma’am, ang magbasa and (Make sure you read first and) take notes of the important or salient points of the law. Otherwise, I said, a misplaced comma could change the meaning of everything,” he said.
Last week, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said the HTAC is evaluating the Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines since the government is expected to procure 1 million doses this month under a PHP700 million purchase deal.

“We should not be reluctant about the vaccine and be prepared for the vaccine, we need to be inoculated so that we can alleviate the loss of dear lives,” said CBCP-ECH vice chairman Bishop Oscar Jaime Florencio.
He said the public should make use of the available vaccine after the government announced that another 1.4 million doses of Sinovac CoronaVac vaccine are set to arrive on March 21.
Aside from the CoronaVac jabs, the country is slated to receive around 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines through the COVAX Facility, to be delivered until May.
On Sunday, Moderna Inc. announced it has signed a supply agreement with the Philippines for 13 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine that will arrive by the third quarter of this year.
“We know that this Covid will stay even without vaccine or with vaccine. They will stay with us for a while. Now, we know that there is already an available vaccine out there, it might not be enough, but it is there already and for us Catholic this may be the answer to our Oratio Imperata. Why not avail for those who are given the slots. Otherwise, our Oratio will be useless,” he said in an interview.
The Philippines received its first batch of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine on Feb. 28 donated by China and 520,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine that arrived in two batches through COVAX Facility on March 4 and 7.
As for those who expressed concerns about the Covid-19 vaccine side effects, Florencio said the faithful are not being forced to have the vaccine.
“Now for those, who would want to argue that this or that vaccine has many side effects, any other vaccines have their side effects. If we are not sure, don’t get the vaccine. But if we know that we are healthy and ready for the vaccine and we’re given a slot, then take it,” he said. “Just like what the experts said the best vaccine is what you have now, because the other vaccines have not been approved and we have not acquired them.”

CEBU CITY – The Department of Health (DOH) in Central Visayas on Monday said it has not monitored significant adverse event reactions from more than a thousand front-liners at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) who have received the CoronaVac jabs.
DOH-7 chief pathologist, Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, said there were only 42 healthcare workers (HCWs), or 3 percent of the 1,397 vaccinees who reported post-inoculation complaints but not all of these were related to the vaccines. 
The data was taken from the VSMMC’s inoculation center from March 4–7.
“Let me explain it this way, what they feel like light-headedness, headache or pain on the injection site or dizziness may not be caused by the vaccine itself. The vaccine will take time in the body to have the precise reaction. They may be incidental findings,” Loreche said.
Most of the reactions recorded by the DOH-7 are pain in the vaccination arm area.
Other complaints were light-headedness, dizziness, feeling tired, numbness in vaccination site, itching, hypertension, headache and fainting.
Loreche, regional Covid-19 spokesperson, said the vaccinee’s failure to take a meal before inoculation and those who have fear of injection would normally experience issues like dizziness after getting the vaccine jab.
“There are adverse events which we may feel even with other vaccines. It’s not fair to connect those issues to the Sinovac vaccines,” she said in mixed Cebuano and English.
More vaccines for the region
Loreche said they are expecting an initial delivery of 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines within the week.
The UK-made vaccines intended for the elderly healthcare workers in the region will be taken from the more than 500,000 doses that arrived in Manila from the COVAX facility.
Loreche said Cebu has so far received a total of 14,680 doses of CoronaVac, the vaccines made by China’s Sinovac Biotech, in two batches. (With report from Carlo Lorenciana/PNA)

MARAWI CITY – Despite her parents being coronavirus disease (Covid-19) skeptics, a 32-year-old nurse at Amai Pakpak Medical Center here decided to be inoculated when the Sinovac jabs were made available among medical front-liners here on Monday.

Norhaisa Aragon, a registered nurse for five years, said she did it to protect her parents, although the latter have repeatedly expressed conspiracy theories about Covid-19 and the vaccines in general.

Aragon, who has been assigned at the triage center since the start of the pandemic last year, said her parents believe Covid-19 is a government-manufactured lie.

Because her job entails assessing and segregating patients if they are suspected as Covid-19 carriers, Aragon said was worried she might contract the virus one day.

""My parents are both diabetic, and they have low immune system. I don't want them to get infected if ever I could get the virus from my workplace. Getting vaccinated will help me,"" Aragon said.

Her parents are not alone in expressing skepticism over the virus.

Some residents, such as Jahari Saber, an ambulant vendor with space outside the Amai Pakpak Medical Center (APMC), said he has not seen anyone sick of the virus in the year since the pandemic broke out.

""For the longest time I have been selling here, I haven't seen anyone who suddenly fell over because they got Covid. What I saw is that they went directly to the hospital because of cough and fever,"" he said in vernacular.

The APMC management started administering Sinovac vaccines to 1,181 employees after receiving the Sinovac vaccines from the Department of Health over the weekend.

Dr. Shalimar Rakiin, APMC chief of hospital, said an overwhelming majority of their staff have expressed interest in receiving the vaccines.

""The workers have the right to refuse. But I am confident that when they see their colleagues being vaccinated, the number of employees willing to receive the jab will increase,"" Rakiin, who was the first to be vaccinated, said.

DOH has given APMC to finish the first dose of vaccination on Thursday, according to Rakiin. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Citing National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said vaccination of frontline medical workers would take at least three months.
“I’m restating what Secretary Galvez said: Matatapos natin ang health front-liners (Health front-liners will be done) by May and we can begin with the economic front-liners by April,” he said in a Palace press briefing.
As of Sunday, Roque said nearly 30,000 frontline medical workers have been vaccinated against Covid-19.
The government, he said, will need 3.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses for 1.7 million healthcare workers in the country.
“Mayroon na tayong halos 30,000 or 29,266 na medical front-liners na nabakunahan (Almost 30,000 or 29,266 medical front-liners have been vaccinated),” he said.
A total of 383,960 vaccines have been deployed where 329,480 are China’s Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines and 54,500 are United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca vaccines.
Roque also said the first dose deployment of Sinovac vaccines has been completed.
“Iyong first dose deployment po ng Sinovac, tapos na po. Na-deploy na po lahat iyong first dose ng Sinovac (The first dose deployment of Sinovac is finished. All the first doses of Sinovac have been deployed),” he said.
Galvez earlier said another 1 million doses of CoronaVac procured by the government are set to arrive the Philippines on March 21.
He said the Chinese government has also vowed to donate additional 400,000 doses of CoronaVac. China’s first donation of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac arrived in the Philippines on Feb. 28.
The Philippines also received 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine through the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility on March 4. Additional 38,400 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine arrived on March 7.

The KCH was among the Covid-19 treatment facilities accredited by the Department of Health (DOH) -12.

The city has received an allotment of 137 Sinovac vaccines from the DOH for health workers directly handling Covid-19 patients.

“The vaccines were immediately stored at the PHP2-million cold storage facility set up by the city government recently,” Mayor Joseph Evangelista told reporters here Monday.

Also on Monday, the mayor led the opening program for the vaccination rollout and lauded all medical front-liners for their selfless service to the people.

Evangelista has also expressed his willingness to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in due time.

“We were excellent. Na-control po natin ang pagkalat ng sakit lalung-lalo na kung ikukumpara tayo sa mas mayayaman at mga bansa na mas mararami at mas moderno ang mga ospital (We were able to control the spread of the virus especially compared to richer countries with more and more modern hospitals),” he said in a Palace press briefing.

“We were excellent in managing it. Unfortunately, habang wala ang bakuna, talagang maraming mahahawa at mayroon pa ring mamamatay (while there is no vaccine, there would really be many infections and deaths). But we have limited deaths to around 12,000 – ikumpara mo naman iyan sa Estados Unidos ‘no (compare that to the US),” he said.

He pointed out that the government was also quick to impose community quarantines nationwide to curb the spread of the virus.
“We declared ECQ just in time na dahilan na hindi tayo napagaya ngayon sa rest of the world na ngayon lang sila nagla-lockdown (which is the reason why we didn’t end up like the rest of the world that just imposed their lockdowns),” he added.
He also said the government prioritized upgrades in the country’s healthcare system capacity.

BUTUAN CITY – The Department of Health in Caraga Region (DOH-13) started the vaccination of more than 4,500 frontline medical workers in the area over the weekend.

In Surigao del Norte, at least 600 health workers at the Caraga Regional Hospital (CRH) and the Surigao del Norte Provincial Hospital received their shots of the Sinovac vaccine.

Among those who were vaccinated Sunday at the CRH were Dr. Angel Batac, head of the Department of Medicine, and other senior medical staffers.

Surigao del Norte Governor Francisco T. Matugas said he hopes the vaccination program would herald the return of normalcy in the country.

“The province of Surigao del Norte is one with the national government in the rollout of Covid-19 vaccination. Let us all pray for the success of the program that will end this pandemic that has caused fear not only among the residents of the province but also in the whole world,” Matugas said.

On Monday (March), the provinces of Surigao del Sur and Agusan del Norte also started the vaccination of their frontline health workers simultaneously.

More than 300 health workers are expected to receive the first round of vaccination in Agusan del Norte this week, out of the 1,500 medical front-liners in the province.

Dr. Odelio Y. Ferrer, Agusan del Norte provincial health officer, was the first person in the province to receive the Sinovac vaccine on Monday.

Gov. Dale B. Corvera said the health workers' willingness to be vaccinated was ""proof that they are concerned to the Agusanons and are willing to continue their services.""

Meanwhile, more than a thousand health workers are also expected to receive the vaccines in Surigao del Sur on Monday.

MANILA – Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto cautioned his constituents against thinking the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is over.
In particular, he asked the working population to be extra careful so as not to bring the virus home.
""Aminin natin, nag-relax na tayong lahat (We should admit that we have relaxed too much). Caution fatigue is real. Let's bring our guard back up. Sumunod sa (Observe the) basic health protocols,"" Sotto wrote on his Facebook page Monday.
As of March 6, Pasig still has 304 active Covid-19 cases, mostly in the barangays of Pinagbuhatan (42), Rosario (28), and Bagong Ilog (27).
Sotto said the city cannot afford another enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) status as “too many people will go hungry”.
“Because of its negative effects on our economy, thousands if not millions will be pushed deeper into poverty for years to come. ECQ was meant to flatten the curve while we strengthen our Covid response,"" he added.
Sotto is still waiting for the recommendations of the city health department as to which villages would be placed under granular lockdowns.
The nationwide vaccination rollout, Sotto reminded, should not make the public complacent and minimum health standards must still be followed.
""Vaccine rollout is dependent on the global supply chain and national distribution,"" he said.
Pasig allotted PHP300 million for its Covid-19 vaccination program. It signed a tripartite agreement with the national government and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for 400,000 doses.

    BACOLOD CITY – The top official of the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH) in this city said he sees better days ahead with the rollout of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine for the hospital front-liners.
“We continue to hope. Today is the start as we immunize about half of the workforce. They would be partially protected and we can serve better. We hope for better days to come. We hope with what we’re doing right now, things will be much different,” Dr. Julius Drilon, medical center chief of CLMMRH, said.
The CLMMRH was among the two Covid-19 referral hospitals here that kicked off the local vaccination program with the inoculation of an initial 16 medical and administrative front-liners in separate ceremonies on Monday.
Both the CLMMRH and the Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (DPOTMH), popularly known as the Riverside Medical Center, were the recipients of some 6,270 doses of CoronaVac developed by Sinovac Biotech, which arrived in the city last Friday.  
At the CLMMRH, nine volunteers, including six doctors, a nurse, and two administrative staff, were the first to be vaccinated with the initial dose.
These included Dr. Franklin Delano Tumaneng, operations chief of the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS); Dr. Joan Cerrada, planning chief of HCEIS;  Dr. Hary Carial, chair of the Department of Internal Medicine; Dr. Eirene Ayalin, chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine; Dr. Carina Frayco, infectious disease specialist; Dr. Rhea Tabujara, pulmonologist; Marybeth Marcial, chief nurse; Antonio Manuel Monfort, chief administrative officer; and John Michael Gabriel Zaragoza, HEICS public information officer.
Drilon thanked the Department of Health and the national government for giving CLMMRH the priority in the initial phase of the vaccine rollout.
“This vaccine is better than no vaccine at all,” Drilon said, adding that some 132 hospital staff tested positive for Covid-19 since August last year, but there are no more active cases at this time.
Drilon said that in the next four to five days, the CLMMRH, which has a total workforce of 1,743 aims to vaccinate about 150 personnel a day, which would mean utilizing an estimated 800 doses for the initial jabs, which will be followed by the second shots after 28 days.  
Those who prefer other brands will be included in the next phase of vaccine rollout, he said.
At the DPOTMH, seven vaccinees participated in the ceremonial vaccination held at the FHM Hall.
Those who took the initial shots were Dr. Jose Pepito Malapitan, acting assistant medical director; Dr. Evram Corral, chair of the Department of Internal Medicine; Dr. Therese Angela Cocjin, infectious diseases consultant;  Dr. Jeanette Umali, head of  Antimicrobial Stewardship Committee;  Ma.

MANILA – There is no need to revert to a stricter community quarantine classification in Metro Manila despite surge in Covid-19 cases, Malacañang said Monday.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said a stricter quarantine status is not yet necessary since the country’s current healthcare capacity is able to handle the rise in Covid-19 cases.
“For the month of March, I don’t think it is called for. Bakit po? Kasi talagang datos po ang ating pinagbabasehan (Why? Because data is our basis),” he said in a Palace press briefing.
Citing data from the health department, Roque said 60 percent of 1,900 intensive care unit (ICU) beds are still available while 65 percent of 13,500 isolation beds remain unoccupied and 75 percent of 6,000 ward beds are also still vacant.
Roque emphasized the need for local government units (LGUs) to step up on their efforts to test, trace, and treat.
“Inaatasan na po natin ang lahat kasama na po ang ating mga lokal na pamahalaan na hindi lang paigtingin ang ating minimum health standards, ipatupad na po natin iyong ating institutional isolation ng mga nagkakasakit. Kinakailangan paigtingin na natin iyong ating tracing at kinakailangan i-isolate din natin iyong mga tao na nagkaroon na ng close contact at bigyan ng [polymerase chain reaction] test iyong mga taong nagkaroon na ng close contact (We direct the local governments not just to enhance the implementation of minimum health standards, but also implement institutional isolation of those infected. We need to enhance tracing and isolation of those with close contact and give PCR tests to those who have had close contract),” he said.
He said LGUs also have the power to impose localized or granular lockdowns in areas with a surge in Covid-19 cases.
“Iyong kalye, iyong bahay, iyong compound na mayroong mga maraming sakit, i-lockdown ninyo na po iyan dahil iyan po talaga ang ating istratehiya ngayon (Implement a lockdown in the street, house, compound with high cases because that’s really the strategy now),” he added.
Roque said the Philippine economy could not afford to revert to a stricter community status as many were going hunger and between jobs.
Former Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit, for his part, attributed the surge in Covid-19 cases to a drop in compliance with minimum health and safety standards.
""Ang tingin ko (I think) the surge is actually due to a drop in compliance, which we can fix, and also an increase in mobility. Diyan natin kailangan ibalanse (That’s what we need to balance) because we want to open the economy,” he said.
Roque appealed to the public not to get tired observing minimum health standards such as wearing of face masks and face shields, frequent hand-washing, and physical distancing.
“Aking pakiusap, huwag po kayong mapagod kasi ngayon ay nandito na ang bakuna, narito na iyong simula ng katapusan ng ating problema (Our appeal is, don’t get tired because the vaccine is here, this is the beginning of the end of our problem),” he said.
Roque, meanwhile, urged frontline medical workers to get vaccinated against Covid-19.
As of Monday, health authorities recorded 3,356 additional Covid-19 cases bringing the total number of cases in the country to 597,763. This is the fourth consecutive day that more than Covid-19 cases breached the 3,000 mark.
Recoveries reached 545,912 after six more people got well and five more deaths brought the death toll to 12,521.
The OCTA Research group on Sunday warned that the Philippines may see 6,000 new Covid-19 cases daily by March 31 if the surge is not managed.
Metro Manila, Apayao, Baguio City, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Batangas, Tacloban City, Iligan City, Davao City, and Lanao del Sur have been placed under the stricter general community quarantine (GCQ) until March 31. The rest of the country is already under most relaxed modified GCQ. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

BALANGA CITY, Bataan – The government targets to inoculate about half of the country's total population against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) this year, Secretary Vivencio Dizon, deputy chief implementer of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, said on Monday.
Dizon came here to witness the first inoculation with Sinovac vaccines of top officials of the Bataan General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC) led by its director, Dr. Ria Baltazar.
“Mga 50 million people ang target natin this year na mabakunahan (Our target is around 50 million people to be vaccinated this year),” he said in his speech, as he noted the rise in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the country and what government is doing to curb further spread of the virus.
“Tuluy-tuloy lang ang ating mga interventions, preventions, pagte-testing, tracing, isolation at pagti-treat pero kasabay niyan ngayon mayroon tayong dagdag na proteksyon, yong pagbabakuna natin (Our interventions, preventions, testing, tracing, isolation and treatment are continuous but, at the same time, we now have extra protection, our vaccinations,” Dizon said.
Cases of other variants of the virus are rising in Metro Manila so there is a need to strengthen the intervention, he noted.
He reminded the public to continue observing the minimum health standards such as the washing of hands, wearing of face masks and physical distancing.
“Kailangan mas mabilis ma-roll out ang mga bakuna natin lalo na sa mga health care workers para kapag naospital ang mga positive sa Covid-19 ay protektado sila (We need to roll out our vaccines faster, especially for health care workers so that when those who tested positive for Covid-19 are hospitalized, they are protected),” Dizon added.
He could not give the exact number of those already vaccinated, saying the Department of Health (DOH) will provide the update.
Dizon also said more vaccines against Covid-19 will be arriving in the country in the next few weeks and months.
He said that as more vaccines arrive, Bataan should be given priority in inoculation, being a major industrial and marine travel site “para masiguro na tuluy-tuloy ang pag-andar ng ekonomiya (to ensure the continuous operation of our economy).”
Dizon also gave tribute to health care workers, adding that the supply of AstraZeneca vaccines should be reserved for the elderly in the sector.
“Kayo ang frontliner, kayo ang ating mga bayani at nararapat lamang na kayo ang unang-unang tatanggap ng bakuna kaya maraming-maraming salamat sa inyong sakripisyo at ito ay galing sa ating mahal ng Pangulo na lahat nang dumating regardless sa kung anong brand yan, lahat ng unang darating na bakuna sa Pilipinas ay para sa inyo (You are the front-liners, you are our heroes and you deserve to be the first to receive the vaccine. So, thank you very much for your sacrifices and these came from our dear President regardless of what brand it is. All the vaccines that are first to arrive are all for you),” he said.
Dizon asked DOH-Region 3 (Central Luzon) director Cesar Cassion to reserve the AstraZeneca vaccines for health workers in Bataan.
He also described the present mood of health workers amid the start of vaccination as different from last year’s when the deadly virus started to adversely affect the country.
“Ngayong araw na ito ay iba na ang nakikita sa mga health workers. Nakangiti na sila at kitang-kita na imbes mukha ng takot ay mukha na ng pag-asa ang makikita sa mga mukha nila. Kaya napakalaki ng simbolo na sila ang unang-unang babakunahan ng mga unang bakuna na dumating nitong nakaraang mga araw (Today, what we are seeing is different with the health workers. They are already smiling and it is obvious that instead of a face of fear, a face of hope could be seen. So, it is a huge symbol that they are the first to be inoculated with the vaccines that came out in recent days,” Dizon said.
He noted that he was inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine, which had no adverse effect on him. He said the vaccine from China is safe and urged everyone to take it.
Dizon, together with Bataan Governor Albert Garcia, Rep. Jose Enrique Garcia III and Mayors Francis Garcia of Balanga City and Gila Garcia of Dinalupihan also inspected the Bataan People’s Center that will serve as the province's mass vaccination center. (PNA)

MANILA – House Speaker Lord Allan Velasco on Monday urged Filipinos to be more vigilant amid the uptick in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across Metro Manila.
In a statement, Velasco said Filipinos must continue to follow public health protocols until the country has been broadly immunized to prevent further transmission of Covid-19.
“While we understand that more businesses are reopening and people want to resume normal activities, we have to maintain our health protocols until the Covid-19 threat is effectively addressed by our vaccination program,” Velasco said.
Velasco cited OCTA Research projection that the country may post up to 6,000 new Covid-19 cases per day by the end of March.
He said the additional cases in the country reached over 3,000 for three straight days since Friday.
The arrival of the vaccine in the country and its rollout should not be a reason to “let our guard down,” he added.
“We have to wait until such time a greater number of Filipinos are vaccinated and herd immunity has been achieved,” he said.
He said the recently-signed Covid-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 would put the country in a better position to defeat the virus and protect the health of its 110 million people.
The law expedites the purchase and administration of Covid-19 vaccines and sets up an indemnity fund to compensate individuals who will experience adverse effects after vaccination.
“This landmark legislation was designed to fast-track the procurement and administration of the life-saving vaccine against the deadly coronavirus to a greater number of Filipinos,” he said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – At least 5,293 medical front-liners of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) have been inoculated so far with the Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccines as many have responded to the call, AFP public affairs office chief Navy Capt. Jonathan Zata said on Monday.
Zata said the vaccinees came mostly from military treatment facilities (MTFs) in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the 4th Infantry Division in Cagayan De Oro.
""Mainly from the MTFs of the NCR and 4th Infantry Division. Other MTFs (from the Unified Command) will be starting today (Monday),"" he said.
Vaccination of military health front-liners started on March 1, a day after the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine donated by China arrived in the country.
The exact number of vaccinees per MTF is still being collated as of this time, Zata said.
MTFs located in Metro Manila include the Victoriano Luna Medical Center and the Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo Station Hospital, both in Quezon City; Manila Naval Hospital and the Philippine Army General Hospital, both in Taguig and the Philippine Air Force General Hospital in Pasay City.
On Sunday, Philippine Air Force (PAF) spokesperson Lt. Col. Maynard P. Mariano said the air force is committed to transporting the Covid-19 vaccines in different parts of the country.
“Rest assured, the PAF will be relentless in transporting vaccines as the government's workhorse and is one with the nation in the fight against Covid-19,"" he said.
The PAF delivered 5,260 vials of Sinovac Covid-19 vaccines to Puerto Princesa City, Palawan on March 5 via a C-295 medium transport aircraft.
""Upon its arrival at Antonio Bautista Air Base, the vaccines were turned-over by Presidential Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to Palawan Governor Jose Chaves Alvarez and subsequently to DOH (Department of Health) Palawan Representative Dr. Peter Cumareng,"" Mariano said.

Meanwhile, all police health front-liners in Metro Manila have been vaccinated with CoronaVac vaccines, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Debold Sinas said Monday.
In a media interview, Sinas said the PNP received 1,400 for its police health workers in NCR.
He said the medical front-liners are from the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon, and the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig.
He said they are still waiting for the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Diseases’ (IATF-EID) guidance if the PNP will also be given allocation from the 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines that arrived in two batches through the COVAX Facility on March 4 and 7.

(PNA photo by Allen V. Estabillo) 
GENERAL SANTOS CITY – More frontline health care workers in South Cotabato province have signified to get inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine as its rollout went on full swing in the area on Monday.
Dr. Conrado Braña, chief of the South Cotabato Provincial Hospital (SCPH), said they received numerous requests among identified priority health workers for inclusion in the list of recipients in the week-long vaccination drive.
Earlier, he said only 291 of the facility’s over 500 personnel initially agreed to receive the vaccines as some opted to wait for its rollout first.
But, he said such number has so far increased and they expect that more will signify to be inoculated before the end of the vaccination period on March 14.
“We’re getting positive feedback among our workers and they are excited to get the vaccines,” he told the Philippine News Agency.
SCPH, which is based in Koronadal City, received last Saturday from the Department of Health-Region 12 a total of 667 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China out of the 1,838 allotted for the five referral hospitals for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients in the province.
Some 358 doses were delivered to Dr. Arturo P. Pingoy Medical Center and 335 to Allah Valley Medical Specialists Center in Koronadal City; 282 to Howard Hubbard Memorial Hospital in Polomolok town; and 196 to Soccsksargen General Hospital in Surallah.
The vaccination of SCPH workers formally started past 9 a.m. Monday, with medical officer Dr. Bryan Non getting the first shot.
Non, who is an advocate of Covid-19 vaccines, said he is hoping that more of his fellow frontline health care workers will be convinced to also get inoculated against the disease.
He said he carefully studied the Sinovac vaccine based on the results of the clinical trials and it is guaranteed to be safe, with lesser chances for recipients to get allergic reactions.
“It is 100 percent effective in preventing severe cases of Covid-19. So if a vaccine can achieve that and prevent death, then it is effective,” he told reporters.
He urged residents to trust the available vaccines distributed to other countries, including those being provided by the national government, and should get inoculated if they are eligible.
Hannah Ebeo, health education and promotion officer of the South Cotabato Integrated Provincial Health Office, said the vaccination of the priority frontline health workers in the four other Covid-19 referral hospitals started Monday morning.
“This is a simultaneous activity and will continue for seven days,” she said in an interview.
She said they are targeting to inoculate at least 100 individuals per day in each of the vaccination sites.
The acceptance of the Sinovac vaccine is reportedly high in the other referral hospitals in the province, with one facility convincing 90 percent of its workers to get vaccinated.
In this city, the rollout of the Sinovac vaccines started Monday morning with Dr. Ryan Aplicador, the deputy incident commander of the City Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases and also chief of Dr. Jorge P. Royeca Hospital (DJPRH), getting the first shot.
Aplicador said he did not experience any adverse effects from the vaccine during the 30-minute to one-hour observation period.
A total of 670 medical professionals and staff members of DJPRH, one of the six Covid-19 referral hospitals in the city, were prioritized to get the Sinovac vaccines.
Also eligible are 697 workers from the St. Elizabeth Hospital, 527 from General Santos Doctor’s Hospital, 521 from Socsargen County Hospital, 380 from Mindanao Medical Center, and 343 from GenSan Medical Center. (with report from Richelyn Gubalani/PNA)

TACLOBAN CITY – The Department of Health (DOH) is targeting to inoculate more than 27,000 healthcare workers in Eastern Visayas region as a top priority in the vaccination rollout.
DOH Regional Director Exuperia Sabalberino said the pace of vaccination among medical front-liners would depend on the volume of vaccines allocated to the region’s six provinces.
“The top priority is our hospital workers especially those assigned in facilities that treat Covid-19 patients considering their exposure to the virus. The second priority is the public health workers,” Sabalberino said in a phone interview on Monday.
The first batch of 6,900 doses of Sinovac vaccines received by the region last Friday was intended for hospitals in Tacloban City and Palo, Leyte.
""Once we are finished here in Tacloban, our next batch is hospitals in provinces especially those that are catering for Covid-19 patients,"" Sabalberino added.
On Friday, Sabalberino led the ceremonial vaccination at the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center (EVRMC) with the chief of hospital, Dr. Salvador Evardone, as the first recipient in the region.
The EVRMC has 1,327 health workers and 200 service contract workers such as security guards and janitorial service personnel.

Eleazar also expressed confidence that the numbers will go up further in the coming days.
He said the PNP has yet to get any advice if it will get an allocation from the 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines that arrived in the country through COVAX Facility on March 4.
As of Saturday night, the PNP has reported 28 new Covid-19 infections, bringing the total active cases to 550 within the agency.
Eleazar, who is also the PNP's Administrative Support for Covid-19 Task Force (ASCOTF) head, said a total of 11,059 cops have recovered after reporting 22 new recoveries.

GENERAL SANTOS CITY – The Department of Health in Region 12 (DOH-12) delivered on Saturday some 3,138 vials of Sinovac vaccines for front-line health care workers of six referral hospitals here for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients.

Mayor Ronnel Rivera, City Health Office chief Dr. Rochelle Oco, and other officials received the vaccines before noon at the designated cold storage facility inside the city gymnasium in Barangay Lagao.

Dr. Sharir Dulduco, DOH provincial officer for Sarangani and this city, said the vaccines are the first batch of the approved allocation for the city based on the number of priority health workers directly handling Covid-19 patients.

Dulduco said the priority recipients include physicians, nurses, and other medical personnel of hospitals with dedicated wards and treatment facilities for Covid-19 cases.

“This is enough for the first dose of the identified priority health workers,” he said in an interview with reporters.

At least 697 doses were allotted for the St. Elizabeth Hospital, 670 for Dr. Jorge P. Royeca Hospital, 527 for General Santos Doctor’s Hospital, 521 for Socsargen County Hospital, 380 for Mindanao Medical Center, and 343 for GenSan Medical Center.

Dulduco said they expect the delivery of the additional vaccines before the inoculation for the second dose after 28 days.

He said not all of the 3,138 target recipients have so far signified to get the vaccines, but they hope to convince them once the inoculation starts.

“We can still give them the vaccines if they change their minds after one day, two days, or even after a week,” he said.

Oco said they will start the vaccination on Monday and it will be conducted simultaneously region-wide based on an advisory issued on Friday night by the DOH-12.

She said all six vaccination sites have completed their simulation exercises and finalized their contingency preparations.

“We’re targeting to vaccinate 16 individuals per hour and complete the inoculation within seven days,” she said.

She reiterated that the vaccination would not be mandatory, and everyone has the option of whether to get them or not.

But Oco said they are continually encouraging all the target health workers to accept the Sinovac vaccines, which she guaranteed as safe and effective against Covid-19.

She said studies showed that the vaccine provides 50 percent protection from having symptoms of the disease and 100 percent from developing into a severe case.

“That’s a huge benefit for those directly handling our patients and our health care system as a whole,” she said.

 Rivera said the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines and the upcoming inoculation of local health workers is a “game-changer” for the city.

“It’s a major step towards our hope that we can already go back to normal activities soon as well as our target to fully reopen our economy,” he said.

As of Friday evening, the confirmed Covid-19 cases in the city already reached a total of 2,021 and with 78 related deaths but 1,823 of the patients have fully recovered.

The 120 active patients, mostly with mild symptoms and asymptomatic, are currently undergoing observation and treatment in seven local hospitals and two temporary isolation units. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Secretary Silvestre Bello III on Saturday announced that they will issue an advisory on the issue of vaccination in workplaces early next week.
“We will issue an advisory, not an order on Monday. We will advise everyone that nobody can be forced to undergo vaccination without his or her consent and any policy that is requiring vaccination for work will be declared illegal,” he said in a Laging Handa briefing.
Bello said this is to make employers aware of this rule.
On the other hand, he urged workers to report to the department employers or companies that are requiring employees to get the vaccine before they will be allowed to enter the workplace.
“They can report it to our DOLE offices, we have city, municipal, provincial and regional offices and they can also call our hotlines: 1439 and 1438,” the Labor chief said.
Bello, however, said they have yet to receive any complaints from employees regarding the issue.
“We have not received any complaint yet. In fairness, the president of the Employers’ Confederation of the Philippines had said they will not implement such because they know that it has no legal basis and you cannot force the workers to get vaccinated, we don’t have the vaccines yet,” he said.

At the Laoag City General Hospital (LCGH), Dr. Crizelda C. Derpo, a medical and infectious specialist, got the first Sinovac vaccine injection.
The ceremonial vaccination rollout was witnessed by some employees of the city government led by Mayor Michael Keon and 61 other health care worker-vaccinees of the hospital.

MANILA – The city government of Manila has completed the vaccination of 1,499 medical front-liners on Friday with the full allocation of the jabs given to the city by the national government.
Manila received a total of 3,000 doses of the China-made CoronaVax vaccine, which is good for 1,500 individuals.
However, Manila Mayor Francisco ‘Isko Moreno’ Domagoso reported that they found one CoronaVac vial already broken when they opened the box. The incident was already reported to the Department of Health (DOH).
Since the city started its Covid-19 vaccination drive on Tuesday, Domagoso was happy to announce that no adverse reactions on vaccine recipients have been reported yet.
“Apat na araw lamang ay nailunsad natin ng maayos ang vaccination rollout. Salamat sa Diyos, its been four days wala pang napaulat na masamang epekto sa mga nabakunahan na ng Sinovac. Alam kong yan ang ipinag-aalala nyo (In four days, we were able to efficiently rollout our vaccination program. Thanks to God, it’s been four days and nobody has reported any adverse reaction from the Sinovac vaccine. I know that is your worry),” Domagoso said.
Domagoso also thanked the Manila Health Department and all the medical front-liners who cooperated for the successful Covid-19 vaccination rollout.
He said that he was happy for those who opted to receive the Sinovac vaccines.
Medical front-liners who decided late on receiving the China-made vaccine now that the allotted doses for Manila have been consumed will have to wait for the next vaccination schedule.
Despite his previous commitment that he will get himself vaccinated publicly with the CoronaVac jabs, Domagoso said he respects and will continue to follow the national government's vaccination priority policy.
Domagoso explained that Manila’s Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna-Pangan got vaccinated with the CoronaVac despite being a politician because she is a front-liner, being a medical doctor.
Meanwhile, Domagoso assured that the remaining 1,500 doses of the Sinovac vaccines are properly stored.
“Yung natitirang 1,500 ay nakatabi sa ating storage facility para sa second dose ng vaccine after 28 days sa mga nabigyan na (The remaining 1,500 are in our storage facility for the second dose after 28 days for those who have received their first dose),” said Domagoso.

MANILA – The government has assured that the priority framework of the vaccination rollout of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) jabs will be strictly followed.
In a statement on Friday night, National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the framework prioritizes medical front-liners and health care workers, to be followed by senior citizens and other vulnerable sectors. 
Galvez also thanked government officials, civil society organizations, and other personalities for volunteering to get inoculated in public to boost the people’s trust and confidence in the Covid-19 vaccination campaign.
""We value your support and appreciate your intention,"" he said. ""Indeed, seeing our leaders getting inoculated will significantly affect the perception and decision of our countrymen on the vaccine program.""
However, due to the limited global supply of vaccines, Galvez said the government would have to adhere to the recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and President Rodrigo Duterte's directive to strictly allocate the Covid-19 vaccines to health care workers.
""The allocation of vaccines must strictly follow the priority framework issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force (for) Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) to ensure that those who have the highest risk of exposure and death will be protected,"" he said.
Galvez noted that the prioritization primarily targets to protect and preserve the country's health care system amid the health crisis.
""The same priority groups have also been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) with respect to the vaccine rollout of almost 44 million doses from the COVAX facility,"" he said.
Galvez said all doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from the WHO-led COVAX facility must be given to the priority groups, starting with health care workers and medical professionals.
""Giving the vaccines to other sectors when not all health care workers have been vaccinated will jeopardize succeeding deliveries from COVAX,"" he said.
Galvez said all Covid-19 vaccines that are set to arrive within this month would be strictly allocated to health care workers nationwide.
""Initial deliveries for April will also follow this allocation until we have completely inoculated nearly two million individuals under this sector,"" he added.
Succeeding sectors in the priority list, including those who will participate in boosting public trust in the vaccination campaign, will be served once the country receives the vaccine supplies for the second and third quarters of the year.
""By respecting and following the priority framework, we will be able to reduce Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, protect the populations most at risk (from) the disease, slow down the transmission rate, and minimize social and economic disruptions.

ILOILO CITY – A doctor at St. Paul’s Hospital Iloilo, one of the four recipient hospitals of the Sinovac vaccines, has urged the public to trust the China-donated vaccines public and welcome the immunization program of the government as it is now up and running.
Dr. Ella Mae Divinagracia, infection control head of the hospital, said the vaccine was given emergency use authorization, hence they have full trust that it was studied thoroughly.
“We have full trust in this vaccine. We believe that receiving this vaccine will offer a 100-percent (protection) against severe Covid-19,” said Divinagracia, one of the first 20 recipients in the ceremonial vaccination held at St Paul’s Hospital here Friday.
Also receiving their first doses were seven other doctors, six nurses, three St. Paul of Charity (SPC) sisters, a medical technologist, a staff member at the Housekeeping Department, and an employee assigned at the Rehabilitation Department.
“At St. Paul’s, we are thankful for this. We consider this as a gift to receive the first batch of the vaccines from the government through the DOH (Department of Health),” she said.
Divinagracia added that the vaccines, along with the observance of minimum health standards, could “add up to their protection” at the hospital, especially because they were the first institution with doctors who got infected.
The hospital is one of the Covid-19 referral hospitals based in this city.
As of Friday morning, more than 300 of their employees have registered for the vaccination rollout that will go full swing on March 8.
The hospital has reserved 1,500 doses with the DOH and has so far received 400 vials.
Due to the limited supply, Divinagracia said they would prioritize their health care workers.
The hospital has been doing simulation exercises and is thus prepared for any eventuality that may occur after the immunization.
A process is being observed to ensure the smooth flow of the inoculation.
She said after the pre-assessment and registration, the vaccinee’s vital signs will be taken.
If he has a risk for a possible reaction, he will be placed under 30-minute monitoring, longer for those who have allergies, she added.
“We hope to have the same experience in Manila but if there are severe reactions, we are ready,” Divinagracia said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Ma. Sylvia Teresa de Pili, chairman of the Internal Medicine Department of the hospital, made history as the first doctor and the first of the 20 recipients to get inoculated in Iloilo.
“I don’t feel anything unusual,” she said when interviewed after receiving her dose.
Second to get vaccinated was Sr. Thessa Marie Ramoso, one of the three SPC nuns who volunteered for the ceremonial vaccination.
Aimee A. Sillo, officer-in-charge of the hospital’s Human Resource Department, said she would recommend that front-liners have themselves immunized regardless of the brand of the vaccine.
“I am a front-liner, a nurse by profession. During this Covid pandemic, it’s really a must for all of us to be vaccinated (against) Covid-19 regardless of the (vaccine) brand. The main intention of the vaccine is to eradicate Covid-19. No matter what brand, okay gid (it's okay),” she said.
Meanwhile, Divinagracia said she hopes the public would receive whatever brand is available because they have no idea when the next vaccine would come.
While the AstraZeneca vaccines have already arrived, she said they don’t know yet if there is an allocation for Iloilo.
“We hope that the public will also be able to recognize the role of the vaccine in preventing against the Covid-19,” Divinagracia added. (PNA)

“Hindi ako confident na hindi ako magkakasakit pag walang self-discipline. Dapat nag-iingat tayo sa mga hinahawakan at parating naghuhugas ng kamay. Dapat din na panatilihin natin na masustansiya ang kinakain natin (I am not confident that I will not get sick if I do not practice self-discipline. We should be wary of what we touch and we should always wash our hands. We should also make sure that we eat only what is healthy),” Romero said.
""Nasa atin magsisimula ang ating proteksyon sa disiplina at pagpapabakuna (Our protection starts with us through discipline and the decision to get vaccinated).”
She was the seventh person to be officially vaccinated in the Cordillera after the region received 7,800 doses of the SinoVac vaccine on Thursday evening.
The BGHMC was the first hospital in the region to receive the vaccines and inoculate its employees.
The first vaccinee in the region was Dr. Ricardo Runez, BGHMC’s chief of hospital, followed by Dr. Rey Suanding, chief professional staff; Dr. Thea Pamela Cajulao, infectious disease specialist; chief nurse Joselito Datud; and lawyer Patrick Henry Villanueva, chief of legal affairs.
Another vaccinee was ambulance driver, Fernando Tong-an, the first employee of the hospital to contract the Covid-19 virus.
A total of 1,801 vaccinees out of the 2,700 employees of BGHMC have registered and given their consent to receive the SinoVac vaccine.
Dr. Runez said 100 employees were scheduled to be vaccinated on the first day of the rollout.
“We will finish about 100 to 200 vaccinees every day until we finish all those who have initially registered,"" Runez said.
Dr. Ruby Constantino, director of the Department of Health - Cordillera, said the region’s allocation would be given to all public and private hospitals, infirmaries, and medical facilities operating in six provinces and two cities.
A total of 8,828 hospital workers have registered and consented to receive the SinoVac vaccine, Constantino said.
She added that they have a buffer and could ask for additional shots to complete the first dose of the initial registrants in all medical facilities.
Constantino said they expect to receive the additional allocation for the region within March as they have a month before taking the second dose of the vaccine.
The region’s initial allocation from the 600,000 doses of vaccines that arrived in the country was originally allotted for five government hospitals.
She said they were informed of the change in plans as early as Thursday evening when the country got hold of the Philippines’ allocation for the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Meanwhile, Benguet province received its allocation of 1,100 vaccines.
A total of 500 vaccines is intended for workers at the Benguet General Hospital while 600 will be distributed to various public and private medical facilities in 13 municipalities.
Benguet will have its vaccine rollout on Saturday. (PNA)

BACOLOD CITY – Mayor Evelio Leonardia said this city will soon be liberated from the scourge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and has become “part of history” in the rollout of the vaccination program in Western Visayas on Friday.
“It is significant and meaningful that the first Covid-19 case in Western Visayas was recorded in Bacolod City. So, let it also be put on record and let it be part of history that the first vaccination also happened here,” he said.
Leonardia and Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran led city officials in witnessing the ceremonial vaccination program held at the Bacolod Government Center.
Six medical front-liners in Bacolod were the first to be vaccinated with the Sinovac Biotech vaccine in the region.
“We are on the road to deliverance,” Leonardia said, adding that there is no longer a reason for the public to doubt the Sinovac vaccine after the medical professionals had themselves vaccinated.
The mayor said that most people in Bacolod are adopting a “wait and see” attitude, but after seeing the doctors took part in the rollout of the vaccination program of the city, he believed that more are expected to also have themselves inoculated.
On Friday morning, some 6,270 vials of the Sinovac vaccine arrived at the Bacolod-Silay Airport in Silay City and were brought to the cold room at the Bacolod Government Center Annex Building.
The supply is intended for 3,135 healthcare workers of two Covid-19 referral hospitals in Bacolod - Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital and Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (Riverside Medical Center).
It is the first batch of vaccines to arrive in Bacolod, which is part of the 600,000 doses donated by China to the Philippines.
Those who were vaccinated were Dr. Miguel Sarabia, president of Negros Occidental Medical Society, and wife Valerie Villarosa- Sarabia, who is a registered nurse, as well as Dr. Hector Gayares Jr., chief executive officer of Adventist International Healthcare System Philippines and medical volunteer of Bacolod City Emergency Operations Center; Dr. Dolores Rommela Tiples-Ruiz, infectious diseases specialist and president of Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Negros Occidental Chapter; Dr. Radela Yvonne Ramos-Cortes, an allergologist; and Dr. Carlos Javier Primicias Jr., a pediatrician.
On Thursday, Bacolod recorded no new case and zero death. It has a total of 5,838 confirmed cases, but only 69 are active. Some 5,581 have recovered and 188 deaths. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Share",Joann Villanueva,"March 5, 2021, 7:20 pm","MANILA – The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEI) ended the week flat while the peso finished sideways against the US dollar due mainly to the within-expected inflation print for February 2021. 
 The main equities index ended the trade down by 0.02 percent, or 1.12 points, to 6,881.37 points. 
 All Shares slipped by 0.11 percent, or 4.68 points, to 4,158.54 points.
 Half of the sectoral gauges ended the week up, including the Services index, which rose by 1.05 percent; Financials, 0.27 percent; and Property, 0.06 percent. 
 On the other hand, Mining and Oil fell by 2.45 percent, Industrial by 0.54 percent, and Holding Firms by 0.34 percent. 
 Volume totaled nearly 4 billion shares amounting to PHP7.73 billion. 
 Losers led gainers at 135 to 87, while 45 shares were unchanged. 
 Luis Limlingan, Regina Capital Development Corp. head of sales, attributed the flat close of the main index to the within-expected rise of the domestic inflation rate last February to 4.7 percent from 4.2 percent in January. 
 “Sentiment was rather cautious throughout most of the trading but turned into bargain hunting as investors assessed the statement of Fed (Federal Reserve) Chairman Jerome Powell,” Limlingan said.
 He was referring to the interview during the Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit wherein Powell said economic prospects have improved but the Fed is still far from fulfilling its dual mandate. 
 Meanwhile, the peso remained strong against the US dollar after ending the day’s trade at 48.56 from its 48.62 close on Thursday.
 Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort identified other factors on Friday’s foreign exchange trading, apart from the acceleration of the domestic inflation rate in February.
 Ricafort said these include the end of the government’s retail treasury bond offer, market optimism on the arrival of more coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines, and the correction of the US stocks markets amid the rise in the 10-year US Treasury bond.   
 “More Covid-19 vaccine arrivals and rollouts would increase the likelihood of a nationwide MGCQ (modified general community quarantine) sooner, thereby improving market sentiment and the overall economic recovery prospects,” he said.
 Ricafort forecast the peso to trade between 48.50 and 48.65 on Monday, and 48.45 and 48.75 next week. (PNA)

BACOLOD CITY – Six medical front-liners in this city were the first to be inoculated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in Western Visayas on Friday.
In a ceremonial vaccination held at the Bacolod Government Center, five doctors and a nurse received the initial doses of Sinovac Biotech vaccine, which were part of the 6,270 vials allocated by the Department of Health to two hospitals in the city that arrived just a couple of hours earlier at past 9 a.m.
City officials led by Mayor Evelio Leonardia and Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran witnessed the historic event.
“It’s a great day for Negros and for Bacolod that the vaccines have finally arrived,” Dr. Miguel Sarabia, president of the Negros Occidental Medical Society, said after taking the first shot administered by Dr. Edwin Miraflor, officer-in-charge of the City Health Office.
“We know that vaccines are the most effective way to stop the Covid-19 pandemic and to stop future epidemics. With the vaccination today, we would like to show to the public that we, your doctors, believe that the vaccine is safe, that is good for our body to be vaccinated so that we can go ‘back to normal’ again,” he added.
Sarabia, an ophthalmologist, took the vaccine together with his wife Valerie Villarosa- Sarabia, who is a registered nurse.
“Why did I have myself vaccinated? I’m a front-liner, I’m 59 years old. I cannot guarantee safety for myself and my patients all the time. The Sinovac vaccine has a 100 percent safety rate for serious Covid-19. It is a very good vaccine, with 100 percent efficacy…This one is a new vaccine for a very deadly virus. We are glad to be the first people (in Bacolod) to receive this gift of life,” he added.
Also vaccinated were Dr. Hector Gayares Jr., chief executive officer of Adventist International Healthcare System Philippines and medical volunteer of Bacolod City Emergency Operations Center; Dr. Dolores Rommela Tiples-Ruiz, infectious diseases specialist and president of Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Negros Occidental Chapter; Dr. Radela Yvonne Ramos-Cortes, an allergologist; and Dr. Carlos Javier Primicias Jr., a pediatrician.
Gayares said he took Sinovac as protection against Covid-19 because “it is the safest for me”.
“It’s unattenuated. It’s a dead virus. It has maintained its spike protein. It does not interfere with any other mechanism in my body except to stimulate the immune system to produce anti-bodies. That’s the normal, traditional way of making vaccines and letting the vaccines work in you, and Sinovac used that kind of technology,” he added.
Tiples-Ruiz pointed out that if a person has a choice, the brand of vaccine would matter in deciding to be vaccinated.
“But remember, we have an increase in demand and supply is not enough for everybody. The more people that are inoculated as soon as possible the better. We need to see this as a collective effort to address the Covid-19 pandemic. The safety of the vaccines is assured and the efficacy helps us,” she said.
Ramos-Cortes said that in a way, the brand matters in choosing what vaccine to take, but in times of a pandemic, the choice would be to be vaccinated as early as possible, and anyone should grab the chance to be vaccinated.
“I have no hypertension and I don’t have diabetes so I’m really okay with Sinovac. I would go for it because it’s the first vaccine that’s available for me so I chose to take it,” she said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

CEBU CITY – The chief pathologist of the Department of Health (DOH) in Central Visayas has remembered the “fallen heroes” who died while fighting the coronavirus disease (2019) pandemic last year, as she stepped up as among the first healthcare workers who took the China-made CoronaVac jabs in Cebu.
“I want to offer this vaccination that I had yesterday (to my colleagues who died because of Covid-19). I wished they were still alive and they would have been part of this momentous moment,” DOH-7 chief pathologist Dr. Mary Jean Loreche told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) in an interview Friday.
Loreche, who also is the Covid-19 spokesperson in the region, said she remembered sending blood and convalescent plasma for Dr. Karen Senen, pediatrician-neonatologist of Philippine General Hospital (PGH) in Manila when the latter was admitted for the second time due to coronavirus.
Senen was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after contracting Covid-19 while treating other coronavirus-positive patients in Manila.
“I don’t personally know her (Senen) but when she was readmitted the second time and they needed blood and convalescent plasma, I responded and sent to the University of the Philippines-PGH but sadly she didn’t make it,” Loreche said.
In Cebu, a couple who are both well-known physicians here also succumbed to Covid-19.
“It was doubly tragic for the family of Dr. Dennis Ramon Tudtud, one of the eight University of the Philippines alumni who fought and died in the frontlines of the war against the vicious viral adversary. Dr. Tudtud, a prominent Cebu City oncologist, succumb to the virus on March 31, four days after his wife, Dr. Helen Evangelista Tudtud, a pathologist at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC), expired after fighting the virus for 11 days,” an article published at the University of the Philippines’ (UP) website on April 4, 2020 said.
Loreche said she knew personally the Tudtud couple, saying they worked together for the same hospital in Region 10.
Dr. Dennis was a cancer specialist, Loreche said, adding that she handled his patients’ biopsies before treatment. The wife, Dr. Helen was also a pathologist like her.
UP also paid tribute to “eight UP alumni who fell in the frontlines of what has become a global war against the virus”.
“They died alone, with no relatives around to hold their hands as they breathed their last. Some still have to be buried, and others were cremated with no ceremony and no one to bid them goodbye,” the UP article read.
Loreche said she also considered her volunteering to the vaccination roll out to her family which she had not seen for quite a while due to the pandemic.
She also prodded other healthcare workers who refused to be vaccinated with the CoronaVac to remember their colleagues in the profession who died while taking the risk of serving the front-line without the benefit of getting a vaccine.
“And to my children, who patiently waits for my very rare visits in Manila as they understood my super busy work and my avoidance of exposing them to the virus. And to all of our colleagues in the front-lines, our families and countrymen, let’s be vaccinated and help save lives,” she said.
Loreche was among the five officials who took the first dose of CoronaVac in a ceremony at the VSMMC on Thursday.
Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr., VSMMC’s chief of hospital, led them in the inoculation rollout and was recognized as the first medical front-liner who took the CoronaVac jab in the Visayas and Mindanao.
The doses that Loreche, Aquino, Inter-Agency Task for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) deputy chief implementer Melquiades Feliciano, and two other hospital chiefs were part of the 7,200 doses sent from Manila to Cebu for inoculation of healthcare workers.

GENERAL SANTOS CITY – Local health authorities are targeting to start within the next two to three days the inoculation using Sinovac vaccines among over 3,000 priority health care workers in the city.
Dr. Ryan Aplicador, deputy incident commander of the City Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, said Friday they are all set for the rollout of the vaccination, which will be conducted in six referral hospitals in the area for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients.
He said they expect the delivery of the vaccines anytime on Saturday based on an advisory from the Department of Health (DOH) in Region 12.
A total of 17,940 vials of Sinovac vaccines for Region 12 (Soccsksargen) arrived before noon Friday at the Awang airport in Maguindanao and were brought to the cold storage facility of the DOH-12 in Cotabato City.
“We will start the vaccination either on Sunday or Monday, depending on the availability of the recipients,” Aplicador told reporters.
The City Health Office, in coordination with DOH-12, conducted Friday a series of simulation exercises in preparation for the vaccination activities.
At least six vaccination sites were established within the compounds of the city’s six Covid-19 referral facilities - the local government-run Dr. Jorge P. Royeca Hospital (DJPRH), St. Elizabeth Hospital, General Santos Doctor’s Hospital, Socsargen County Hospital, Mindanao Medical Center,
and GenSan Medical Center.
The local government has set up a cold storage facility for the vaccines at the city gymnasium in Barangay Lagao.
Aplicador, who is also the hospital chief of the DJPRH, said they successfully simulated at least two scenarios for the actual vaccination, specifically with the vaccines already available on-site and another with the supplies coming from the cold storage facility.
He said they also tested the screening process and accurately detected hospital personnel who has just recovered from Covid-19 and ineligible from getting the vaccine for 90 days.
The official said about half of the 542 identified priority DJPRH workers for the vaccination have already signified to get the vaccines.
He admitted that some are still having second thoughts and preferred the other vaccine brands.
“We’re continually encouraging our workers to get vaccinated now and expect that number to increase once we start with the inoculation,” he said.
In South Cotabato, Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO) chief, Dr. Rogelio Aturdido Jr., said they also ready to receive the first batch of the Sinovac vaccines and the conduct of the vaccination.
The IPHO has listed a total of 1,838 health care workers from five Covid-19 referral hospitals in the province as eligible to get the shots.

Aside from the 600,000 doses of Sinovac and 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines donated to the country, another one million doses of Sinovac this month and hopefully the Pfizer vaccine in the coming months are expected, National Policy Against Covid-19 chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said in an interview.
All in all, the country is slated to receive 4.5 million doses of anti Covid-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility until May, Galvez said.
The first Covid-19 vaccination in Davao City was witnessed by the entire Inter-Agency Task Force team headed by Galvez and Health Secretary Dr. Francisco Duque III, and Cabinet members including Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.

ZAMBOANGA CITY – The government-run Zamboanga City Medical Center (ZCMC) has rolled out its vaccination program Friday afternoon following the arrival of Sinovac vaccines in this city.
Dr. Afdal Kunting, ZCMC chief, led the vaccination program as he was the first to be inoculated among the hospital's staff.
Kunting was inoculated by Myla Alcoriza, who was among the ZCMC nurses trained to conduct vaccination.
“Actually, to be honest, I did not feel anything when I was injected. I came to know it was finished when I saw the needle was removed,” Kunting said shortly after his inoculation.
Alcoriza, meanwhile, said it was an honor for her to be the one to administer the vaccine to her boss.
“It a privilege and I am lucky enough that I was the one who inoculated our hospital chief,” Alcoriza said.
Initially, Kunting said 10 ZCMC physicians, nurses, and medical technologists were inoculated during the activity.
He said at least 250 ZCMC staff members will be inoculated daily based on the plan they have prepared.
However, he said not all of the 1,600 hospital personnel will be inoculated as some of them are not eligible to receive the vaccines.
“They were either above 59 years old and are nursing mothers,” he added, citing they have an assessment team to determine who are eligible to be inoculated.
He said they initially received 550 doses of Sinovac vaccines from the Department of Health (DOH) regional office.
The vaccines allotted to the ZCMC are part of the 10,200 doses that arrived here on Friday morning from Manila.
Kunting said they will get the vaccines allotted to ZCMC from the DOH storage facility as the vaccination drive will continue until all staff members are inoculated.
Meanwhile, Kunting encourages the public to have themselves vaccinated to be protected against coronavirus disease 2019. (PNA)

 COTABATO CITY - A total of 17, 940 vials of Sinovac vaccines arrived at Awang Airport in Maguindanao shortly before Friday noon for health workers in Region 12 (Soccsksargen), health officials said.
Dr. Aristides Tan, the regional health director, said that 8, 967 health workers in 23 referral hospitals for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the region are beneficiaries of the vaccines.
“The vaccines are good for two doses for the prioritized health workers,” Tan said in a press briefing here.
He added that of the 23 hospitals, five are in North Cotabato; South Cotabato - 4; Sultan Kudarat – 4; Sarangani – 2; General Santos City – 6; and two DOH – 12 retained hospitals - those of the Cotabato Regional and Medical Center (CRMC) in Cotabato City and the Cotabato Sanitarium Hospital (CSH) in Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao - are also included in the vaccine allocation.
This city, once a part of Region 12, is now under the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) while Maguindanao is a long-time province component of BARMM.
“Due to the proximity of the two areas to Region-12 that the two hospitals were retained under our supervision,” Tan said.
General Santos City has the largest number of the allotted vaccine recipients at 3,138; followed by the CRMC and CSH in Cotabato City and Maguindanao with a combined number of 2, 138; South Cotabato – 1, 838; Sultan Kudarat – 1,076; North Cotabato – 441; and Sarangani – 336.

CITY OF SAN FERNANDO, Pampanga – Governor Dennis Pineda inspected on Friday a cold storage facility that will keep the first batch of 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine purchased by the provincial government.
The Provincial Vaccine Cold Storage Facility, which houses six freezers, is located at the Provincial Engineer’s Office Compound in Barangay Sindalan.
Provincial administrator Charlie Chua said the freezers’ temperatures are set according to the brands of the vaccine.
“Four freezers can keep an average of 70,000 doses of AstraZeneca. Another freezer can hold 51,030 doses of Pfizer and the other one can store 5,240 vials of Moderna or up to 48,960 vials of Sinovac,” Chua said in media interview.
He added that the second batch also consists of 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca.
The governor said local governments can use the storage for their vaccine supplies.
Pineda said the AstraZeneca vaccines are scheduled to arrive in the province between June and July 2021.
Coming in two doses, AstraZeneca vaccines are to be injected at no cost to 300,000 individuals among them health workers, essential workers, and senior citizens.
The vaccination will be done in private hospitals and the provincial government’s 10 district hospitals.
Those hospitals will also monitor the recipients’ reactions to the vaccine, he said.
Pineda added that more doses would be purchased so that more residents have anti-bodies against SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), which has killed 438 people and infected 7,161 others in the province as of March 3.
He said the national government has allocated to Pampanga a share of the Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines donations through the Jose. B. Lingad Memorial General Hospital.

CEBU CITY – The 17,480 doses of CoronaVac vaccines that arrived on Friday in Cebu has signaled the start of the inoculation rollout in this capital city and the neighboring provinces of Bohol, Negros Oriental, and Siquijor, the Department of Health (DOH)-Central Visayas said.
Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, DOH-7 chief pathologist and Covid-19 spokesperson, said the vaccines made by Sinovac Biotech in China are allocated for healthcare workers in the said localities who are being listed as priority sector in the national vaccination plan.
“For Cebu City, these (vaccines) will be for level 3 hospitals (in) both private and government,” Loreche told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) in a message.
The excess vaccine doses from the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center will be administered to healthcare workers of the three public hospitals in Cebu, namely, the Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital in Mandaue City and St. Anthony Mother and Child Hospital in Barangay Basak here and Talisay District Hospital in Talisay City.
Loreche said they expected no wastages in the vaccines that arrived in Cebu “as in the next in line will be the DOH team (such as) swabbers, medical technologists assigned to the molecular laboratory, nurses and medical technologists (assigned) in the blood drive, and the EOC (Emergency Operations Center)” in this city.
The 17,480 doses of the vaccine arrived at the Mactan-Cebu International Airport from Manila at 7:35 a.m. on Friday via a Philippine Airlines flight from Manila.
Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV) Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales said the second batch of vaccines made by Sinovac vaccines will be delivered to the Governor Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital (GCGMH) in Tagbilaran City, Bohol, and the Silliman University Medical Center Foundation Inc. in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.
Bohol will get 8,440 doses while Dumaguete City will have 1,200 doses.
From the Mactan airport, the vaccines were immediately transported to the Department of Health-Central Visayas regional office’s cold room for sorting before the vaccines will be delivered to Bohol and Negros Oriental accordingly.
The Office of Civil Defense in Central Visayas (OCD-7), which is in charge of the vaccine logistics, has asked for OPAV’s assistance in delivering vaccines to the two provinces.
Gonzales on Thursday said OPAV has already arranged a vessel to transport both deliveries to Bohol with the help of Philippine National Police-Regional Maritime Group-7 chief Col. Rizalino Padrique, and to Negros Oriental with the Philippine Navy‘s assistance.
The vaccination program has already started in Cebu on Thursday, with some healthcare workers led by Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) chief Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr. inoculated with the initial allocation of 7,200 doses of CoronaVac jabs.
These doses are part of the 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines and arrived in the country on February 28.
Lawyer Rey Cris Panugaling, head of VSMMC’s Office of Strategy Management, told the PNA in a message that as of Friday noon, at least 263 HCWs from the hospital have been inoculated with the CoronaVac jabs since Thursday.

MANILA – The initial batch of Moderna vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is expected to arrive in the Philippines by May or June 2021, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Romualdez said Friday.
""We've already concluded the agreement, 'yong supply na lang (the only problem now is the supply), we're threshing out the supply kung kailan nila puwedeng i-deliver itong (when they can deliver) Moderna,"" he said.
""We're hoping that we will have the first deliveries by either end of May or early part of June,"" he added.
Romualdez said Manila was able to secure about 20 million doses of vaccines developed by the American firm, along with the private sector which helped purchase the vials.
“Almost half of that will go to the private sector and their employees, malaking force 'yan (that's a big force). And then the other half will go to our health workers and the rest of Filipinos that will be receiving the Moderna through the LGUs (local government units) and other entities there in the Philippines,” he said.
The envoy is confident that the delivery would be no later than the second half of the year as America ramps up its vaccine production.
He said at least 117,000 Pfizer vaccines were negotiated through the COVAX Facility, a mechanism that guarantees fair and equitable access to Covid-19 jabs for low to middle-income countries.
Romualdez added that around four million Janssen Covid-19 vaccines were ""readied"" for the Philippines, although the pharmaceutical firm has yet to commit on the delivery date as most of the vaccine manufacturers in the United States are focused on the inoculation of at least 70 percent of the American population.

MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte’s independent foreign policy has helped the Philippines acquire coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines developed by China and the United Kingdom (UK), Malacañang said on Friday.
“Ang ating independent foreign policy, iyan po ang dahilan ngayon kung bakit isa na po tayo sa mga bansang nagbabakuna (Our independent foreign policy is the reason why we are one of the countries that can administer vaccines to their citizens),” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said during the launch of a vaccination drive in Davao City.
The Philippines kicked off its free vaccination campaign on Monday, a day after the Chinese government donated around 600,000 Covid-19 vaccine vials made by Chinese pharmaceutical giant Sinovac Biotech.
On Thursday, the Philippines also received some 487,200 vaccine doses developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca.
The first batch of AstraZeneca vaccines delivered to the country forms part of the 44 million vaccine shots that will be donated to the Philippines through the Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility.
The 487,2000 Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by AstraZeneca were donated to the Philippines by Germany, the European Union, Norway, France, Australia, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, and Greece.
In a speech delivered Thursday night, Duterte said China would also donate additional 400,000 doses of Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines, making its donation to the Philippines one million.
The Philippines would have failed to secure Covid-19 vaccines, had Duterte decided not to implement his independent foreign policy of being “friend to all, enemy to none,” Roque said.
“Kung hindi po tayo nagkaroon ng polisiya made in Davao na tinatawag na independent foreign policy – kaibigan ng lahat at kaaway ng walang kahit sino – hindi po tayo makakatanggap hindi lamang ng 600,000 doses ng Sinovac, kung hindi one million doses (If we had not implemented the policy made in Davao and dubbed as foreign policy of being friend to all and enemy to none, we would have failed to get not only 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines but one million doses),” he said.
Duterte has pursued an independent foreign policy meant to maintain good relations with all nations and avoid siding with other countries.
Roque hoped critics would no longer find fault with Duterte’s foreign policy after it paved the way for the Philippines’ successful launching of its mass vaccination program.
“Sana po wala ng magdududa na tama po ang ginawang polisiya ng ating Presidente dahil kung wala po itong polisiyang ito, wala nga pong bakuna ngayon (I hope no one would no longer doubt the President’s foreign policy because we would have failed to secure vaccines if we had not pursued this),” he said.

TACLOBAN CITY – Eastern Visayas region received on Friday the first batch of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines for hospital workers in this city.
The Philippine Airlines passenger aircraft carrying 7,200 doses of Sinovac vaccines arrived at the Tacloban Airport around 8 a.m. with some members of the regional task force on Covid-19 witnessing the event.
The doses transported in 12 vaccine carrier boxes were sorted out for hours at the Department of Health (DOH) regional office logistics hub ready to be delivered to the hospitals.
“Hospitals in Tacloban City are the top priority since they admitted most of our Covid-19 patients in the region since last year,” DOH regional director Exuperia Sabalberino told reporters.
Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center (EVRMC) chief of hospital Salvador Evardone agreed to be the first to be vaccinated in a scheduled ceremonial immunization around 2 p.m. to boost the confidence of his fellow medical front-liners.
About 600 EVRMC workers have signified to receive the vaccines from China.
EVRMC is the region’s referral hospital and has been treating thousands of severe Covid-19 cases and those infected with other illnesses.
The first batch of vaccines is also for 200 workers of state-run Schistosomiasis Hospital in Palo, Leyte, and 300 medical front-liners of privately-owned Divine Word University Hospital in the city.
The region has about 27,000 health workers in six provinces included in the priority list for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, Sabalberino said.
“We encourage everyone to be immunized because whatever vaccines are allocated to us is safe and efficient. Sinovac has high protection for moderate and severe Covid-19 cases,” Sabalberino added.
DOH assistant regional director Carmen Garado said if some health workers listed as a priority do not want to be inoculated with Covid-19 vaccines, they have names in the quick substitution list.
""It is that not all in the master list will get vaccines as they would change their mind during the counseling and screening. We already advised the facilities to identify substitute,” Garado said in a separate interview.
Aside from the quick substitution list from the three hospitals, the DOH may also consider other health workers from other hospitals and health facilities in Tacloban to be included among the first batch of potential vaccinees.
As of March 5, the region has already recorded 15,696 confirmed Covid-19 cases, including 15,062 recoveries, and 229 deaths. This brings the total active cases to 405. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Department of Health (DOH) regional director Emilia P. Monicimpo, and Civil Defense regional director Jose Roberto Nunez of the Western Visayas Visayas Regional Vaccine Operations Center for Covid-19 were on hand to receive the donations.
From the airport, the vaccines were brought to the DOH cold room warehouse in this city's Mandurriao District.
The recipients are the DOH-managed hospital Western Visayas Medical Center (WVMC) and other private tertiary hospitals, including the West Visayas State University Medical Center (WVSUMC), Iloilo Doctor's Hospital (IDH), and St. Paul Hospital-Iloilo (SPH-Iloilo).

""This is already a complete delivery of the 17,000 doses that we (Western Visayas) are expecting,"" she said.
The other doses, 11 boxes or about 5,000, were delivered to two hospitals in Bacolod City.
As soon as the hospitals are ready, they can immediately start with their inoculation, she said.
""We are instructed to vaccinate within two to seven days. But since we have vaccine hesitancy as to the brand, we are shortlisting other hospitals to be provided by our vaccines,"" she said.
For now, Juanico added, there is at least a 20 to 30 percent drop among target recipients who already gave their consent regardless of the brand.
Regional health officials are coordinating with the hospitals as to the number of workers to be inoculated in the next two to seven days.
With this, the vaccines will not stay long at the DOH regional office and instead will be given to those on the quick substitution list, she said.
In order of priority, the vaccines will be given first to health care front-liners followed by other eligible priority groups.
Juanico said the arrival of the vaccines is a milestone for the whole country.
""This is not only for protection but our contribution also to the global community to stop the Covid-19 pandemic,"" she added.
Monicimpo said the vaccination is one of the strategies to help stop the Covid-19 as she expressed vaccine confidence as these went through studies by experts.

The first doses will be administered Friday and the second doses after 28 days, he said in a press conference at the DOH regional office.
The supplies were delivered to the vaccine storage facility at the DOH regional office for inventory before they were distributed to the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital here, Bicol Medical Center in Naga City, Bicol Region General Hospital and Geriatric Medical Center in Cabusao, Camarines Sur, and Naga Imaging Center Cooperative Doctors Hospital.
“Healthcare workers are most at risk for the infection that’s why they are prioritized. They are directly working in the referral hospitals,” Avelino said.
Excess vaccines will be given to other Level 2 government and private hospitals that have conducted simulation exercises (SIMEX).
“For a hospital or a health facility to be able do the vaccination, it must have held a simulation exercise already. Without SIMEX, we cannot give vaccines since the process determines the readiness of the hospital,” Avelino added.

“For Camarines Sur, SIMEX exercise will be conducted today (Friday), while in Catanduanes, it will be on Tuesday (March 9),” she said.
After the healthcare workers, the next vaccine recipients are senior citizens, people with co-morbidities, uniformed personnel, essential workers and the remaining population.
Avelino asked the public to trust government efforts in combating Covid-19.

Meanwhile, he commended vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, the Inter Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, and the DOH for their efforts throughout the government's pandemic response.
He also expressed the country's gratitude to all COVAX donor countries and reiterated his earlier position that these shots ""should be treated as a global public good.""
""I don’t know how to express my gratitude to the donor countries that you remembered the poor nations [it] is in fact already a plus for humanity. And in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines and of the people, and all, I’d like to say again that we felt the gratitude in our hearts and may God bless you for your benevolence,"" he said.
The vaccines were transported to Metropac in Marikina for storage, with distribution expected to start immediately after repackaging.

MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday encouraged his fellow Filipinos to get inoculated with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines, reassuring them that these are “safe” and will play a key role in reopening the Philippine economy.
Duterte made the call following the arrival of 487,200 doses of Covid-19 vaccines developed by the United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca in the Philippines.
During the turnover rites of AstraZeneca vaccines at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City, Duterte said Covid-19 jabs should be administered to Filipinos the “soonest time possible.”
“I would like to appeal to all our kababayans (countrymen), please get vaccinated against Covid-19 and be the [government’s] partner in preventing further spread of the disease. I encourage you to get vaccinated as a soonest possible time. These vaccines are safe and they are the key to reopening our society,” he said.
The Philippines is expected to receive around 44 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine through the Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, a global initiative that guarantees access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide.
The 487,200 vials of AstraZeneca’s vaccine delivered to the Philippines on Thursday were developed in South Korea and donated by Germany, the European Union, Norway, France, Australia, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, and Greece.
The distribution of Covid-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca will commence after repackaging.
Boosting vaccination drive
Duterte was elated that the Philippines was able to receive AstraZeneva vaccines through COVAX facility.
“Let me thank you, to our key partners in the entire international community represented by their ambassadors tonight. Their cooperation in public health is very much needed. Positive engagement is very much welcome,” he said.
Prior to the delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines to the Philippines, the country also received on Sunday some 600,000 doses of Covid-vaccine from China’s Sinovac Biotech.
The Philippines kicked off its mass vaccination program on Monday, a day after Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccines arrived in the country.
Duterte said the delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines would further boost the Philippine government’s ongoing national vaccination program.
“I also assure the Filipino people that their government will continue working to ensure the immediate distribution of the available vaccines to the communities,” he said.
Continue following health protocols
Duterte maintained that public acceptance of vaccines would help the country recover from the adverse impact of Covid-19 pandemic.
Duterte reminded Filipinos that they still need to observe the health protocols imposed by the government.
“Let us continue observing and practicing health and safety protocols while waiting for more Covid-19 vaccines to reach the Philippines. We may not be out of the woods yet but we are making progress and the end is in sight, and with your cooperation, we will overcome this pandemic and ensure the health and safety of everyone,” he said.
Duterte reiterated that no one is safe until everyone cooperates to ensure the successful fight against Covid-19.
“As I have said before, these vaccines should be treated as a global public good. the need for international solidarity and cooperation cannot be made clearer than this pandemic because no one is safe globally until everyone is safe,” he said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

DAGUPAN CITY– A total of 1,000 out of over 2,000 medical front-liners of the Region 1 Medical Center (R1MC) here will receive the first dose of the Sinovac vaccine on Friday.
 In a forum on Thursday, R1MC chief Dr. Roland Joseph Mejia said the 2,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine were from the 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government to the country.
 “It will be given to the first batch of front-liners in the hospital. The recipients of the vaccine are nurses and medical staff 59 years old and below, and have no underlying conditions,” he said.
 Mejia said they were screened first before they were listed as recipients.
 The inoculation of the first batch will take one week to finish as the health protocols, such as physical distancing, are to be implemented. The second dose will be given after three weeks, he said.
 Mejia said they are continuing with the advocacy campaign on coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccination as a small proportion of the staff are still hesitant to be inoculated.
 “They need to understand that the vaccine is important. If they will not be vaccinated, they will be part of the vulnerable population that were not vaccinated,” he added.
 Mejia said the Sinovac is as effective as the other vaccines.
 “It will not be approved by the World Health Organization if it is not effective. Some other countries have already used it,” he said.
 Some 14,400 doses of the Sinovac vaccine arrived on Thursday that would be distributed to eight referral hospitals in the Ilocos Region, including R1MC. 
 Meanwhile, Mejia said R1MC is all set for the vaccination rollout, including its cold storage facility that could accommodate 40,000 vials of vaccine.
 A simulation on the vaccination was already conducted on Wednesday. Included in the simulation activity was the handling of possible side effects of the vaccine.
 “We have been preparing for this a few months ago so we are ready,” Mejia said. (PNA)

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY – The Department of Health in Northern Mindanao (DOH-10) received Thursday at least 17,400 vials of Sinovac vaccines.

Dr. Ellenietta N. Gamolo, DOH-10 officer-in-charge director, said the vaccines were immediately brought to the DOH-10 warehouse for accounting, checking, and cold chain management from the Laguindingan Airport shortly before 6 a.m. Thursday.

“We will be following the prioritization framework, to start with Covid-19 dedicated hospitals such as Level 3 public hospitals particularly NMMC (state-run Northern Mindanao Medical Center), then Level 3 private hospitals, then Level 2 government hospitals, and level 2 private hospitals,” Gamolo said.

The Sinovac vaccine has been granted emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is considered safe and effective, she pointed out.

“We urge everyone who is part of the priority group for this vaccination to get vaccinated. For those who are not yet a priority for the vaccine, please continue practicing the BIDA Plus Solusyon,” Gamolo said.

Meanwhile, NMMC health workers and staff would be the first to be inoculated on Friday.

Dr. Bernard Julius Rocha, NMMC's liaison officer, said that out of the hospital's 1,700 medical workers, at least 1,300 have agreed to be vaccinated, based on a recent internal survey.

Rocha said medical front-liners manning patient care centers would also be given priority. The plan was to get at least 80 percent inside NMMC's workforce to receive the vaccine, he added

Gamolo said the persons expected to receive the first doses are based on the prioritization group set by the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), and first on the prioritization list are the Level 3 DOH hospitals, such as the NMMC.

The DOH-10 official also assured that the Sinovac vaccines are ""safe and effective to use.""

CEBU CITY – The chief of the regional hospital here Thursday became the first medical front-liner in the Visayas and Mindanao to receive the China-donated coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine, CoronaVac.
Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr., chief of the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC), said he expected other health care workers of the Department of Health (DOH)-run hospital to follow him in taking the first shot.
After Aquino, DOH 7 (Central Visayas) chief pathologist Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases deputy chief implementer Melquiades Feliciano, and two chiefs of public hospitals in the city also received their first dose.
The vaccines administered to them were part of the 7,200 doses of CoronaVac that arrived in Cebu on Tuesday and were allocated for the VSMMC health care workers.
They are also part of the 600,000 doses donated by China to the Philippines.
 Five members of the executive committee of the hospital also took the vaccine.
“We are targeting around 500 staff (of VSMMC) to be vaccinated per day in the next few days,” Aquino said in a press briefing after the ceremonial vaccination at the hospital’s Behavioral Science Building.
He noted that some health care workers backed out and expressed their preference to be inoculated with other brands.
The first vaccinees in the Visayas said they felt fine after getting their anti-Covid-19 shots.
 “Well you know, the usual thing that you feel when you have your vaccines. When I had my flu shot, my pneumococcal shot, there is a little pain I felt in (the) injection site. Other than that, I feel well, I feel okay and elated, actually,” Loreche told reporters.
Aquino said getting a shot of the coronavirus disease vaccine is “like getting injected with other vaccines.”
He received the first dose from Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo.
The VSMMC fielded at least 15 nurses who acted as vaccinators for their colleagues in the hospital who registered to get the CoronaVac in the initial rollout.
The DOH also assigned physicians to conduct pre-screening and post-inoculation monitoring and interview vaccinees to identify possible adverse effects.
Like other hospital staff who underwent counseling, Aquino, Loreche, Feliciano, and the two hospital chiefs also received post-inoculation interviews.
Dr. Jaime Bernadas, DOH-7 director, said 20,000 more doses of Sinovac vaccines will arrive on Friday morning for a public rollout of the national vaccination program.
Bernadas said the Eversley Child Sanitarium and General Hospital in Mandaue City and the St. Anthony Mother and Child Hospital in Barangay Basak in this city have submitted their list of health care workers who will be vaccinated in the coming days.
The list will be part of the “substitute vaccinees” in case some of the more than 3,000 workers at VSMMC decline the CoronaVac and decide to wait for other vaccine brands.
He said in a speech after Aquino’s ceremonial inoculation that the national government intends to vaccinate all health care workers in the country, including those assigned in local government units whom he described as “real medical front-liners”.
Loreche expressed optimism that with them taking the first shot, many of their colleagues would follow.
“We really expect that since we have shown the way to our fellow health care workers, front-liners, Cebuanos, they see that Sinovac vaccine is really safe and we believe that we have to have the vaccine as it is now, as this is the best vaccine that we have for us at this moment,” she said. (PNA)

BACOLOD CITY – Negros Occidental Governor Jose Eugenio Lacson is willing to be vaccinated with China’s Sinovac if it will be made available to him.
“Personally, I’m ready to take even Sinovac. It’s better to have one. It’s better to be vaccinated than just wearing a face mask and face shield. There’s more protection if we have ourselves vaccinated. If they will allow me, I’ll take it,” Lacson said in an interview on Thursday.
The 61-year-old governor said he believes that more people, including those in Negros Occidental, will agree to be vaccinated once they see that healthcare workers in Metro Manila did not experience adverse effects after they were inoculated with Sinovac during the rollout of the national vaccination program on Monday.
“We will be more protected if we get vaccinated,” he added.
Still, Lacson emphasized that even after having vaccinated it is still important to follow the minimum health standards.
The provincial government has committed to buy 100,000 doses of vaccines, primarily intended for medical front-liners, through an agreement with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines Inc.
Last month, the provincial government paid an initial amount of more than PHP4 million as a 20 percent advance payment for the vaccine order.
For the rest of the target population, Lacson said the province has asked for 3 million doses from the national government.
The 3 million doses will reach some 70 percent of the province’s total population, or some 1.5 million Negrenses needing two doses each. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday announced that China would donate an additional 400,000 doses of Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines to the Philippines.
China earlier donated an initial 600,000 doses of CoronaVac which arrived in the country on Sunday.
“China would give us another 400(000), making their donation to this country 1 million,” he said in a speech during the inauguration of two school buildings in Valenzuela City.
Duterte did not give further details about the additional 400,000 CoronaVac vaccine doses to be donated by Beijing.
On Monday, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said 1 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac will arrive this March under a PHP700-million purchase deal.
This is expected to boost the country’s current vaccine supply.
Sinovac's CoronaVac is the third Covid-19 vaccine brand after Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use.
To date, at least 9,077 Filipinos have received CoronaVac in 32 vaccination sites in Metro Manila, three days after the country launched its immunization program against Covid-19.
All vaccine recipients were fine, except for at least 20 individuals who experienced ""minor and common"" adverse effects such as headaches, nausea, rashes, muscle pain, and high blood pressure.
Duterte is expected to witness the arrival of 487,200 doses of the United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca vaccine on Thursday night.
In the same speech, Duterte again said he would not force anyone, especially frontline medical workers, to be vaccinated against Covid-19.
“For those of you who would opt to take that vaccine (AstraZeneca), fine with me. Wala sa akin ‘yan (It’s nothing). Others might prefer other brands,” he said.
Duterte said he personally preferred to be injected with a Covid-19 vaccine developed by state-owned pharmaceutical company Sinopharm.
“Ang akin is Sinopharm, China. Hindi masyado ako maano dyan sa produkto ng puti (Mine is Sinopharm, China. I’m not too keen about products manufactured by whites),” he said.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Duterte will wait for Sinopharm to be cleared for emergency use before he subjects himself to vaccination.

MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday said the government’s national vaccination drive is moving at “full throttle” in time for the proposed face-to-face (F2F) pilot implementation.
Duterte made this assurance during the simultaneous inauguration of school buildings at the Gen. Gregorio H. Del Pilar Integrated School and Virginia Ramirez-Cruz High School in Barangay Sta. Ana in Bulakan, Bulacan.
“I assure you that the government is exerting all efforts to go full throttle in this Covid-19 vaccination program to ensure the safety of students before the resumption of the face-to-face learning,” he said in his speech.
On Wednesday, the Department of Education (DepEd) said students would only be allowed to stay in schools for a maximum of half a day should the proposed in-person classes dry run push through.
The pilot run in areas with low risk of Covid-19 infection was supposed to be implemented last January but was suspended due to the emergence of the more infectious UK variant of the virus.
Duterte recognized the DepEd, the Department of Public Works and Highway (DPWH), and the local government in the successful planning and construction of the new school buildings.
“Your collective efforts in this project have been crucial in creating a more conducive, inclusive and resident-learning environment for students of Bulacan. Our investment in education infrastructure affirms our continuing commitment to promote the right of the people to quality and accessible education at all levels,” he said.
He also emphasized the need to finish the construction of government infrastructure projects as scheduled.
“I reiterate the need to complete government structure projects on time and if possible, I am directing all concerned agencies to ensure the least inconvenience to the public during construction, for ensuring strict adherence to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and prevent corruption,” he added.
Duterte expressed appreciation for the patience, understanding of the students, parents, and teachers in waiting for the completion of the school buildings.
“We are hopeful that these newly built classrooms will provide a more conducive learning environment even as we cope with the new normal,” he said.
Duterte said good education is a “valuable gift” that can be passed on to succeeding generations of Filipinos.
“Let us join hands in developing the full potential of your youth as bearers of our nation’s sustainable future,” he added.
The construction of school buildings at the Gen. Gregorio Del Pilar Integrated School involves two units of four-story with 24 classrooms and one unit of four-story with 12 classrooms, including ground improvement such as jet grouting and an additional embankment.
Likewise, the construction of Pandi National High School, which will serve as an extension of the Virginia Ramirez-Cruz High School, comprises four units of four-story with 20 classrooms and an additional embankment.
Both projects officially started in January 2019 when Duterte similarly led the groundbreaking ceremony of the Gen. Gregorio Del Pilar National High School and the presentation of Pandi National High School miniature model.
Quality education top priority
Duterte also led the inauguration of the new school buildings of the Lawang Bato National High School and Canumay East National High School in a simultaneous ceremony in Lawang Bato, Valenzuela City.
In his speech, Duterte said quality education is one of his administration’s “top priorities”.
“Making quality education to all Filipinos is one of my administration’s top priorities in the development agenda. As a matter of fact, in the budget yearly, the highest ng pera mapunta number 1 is education (the department with the highest budget is education),” he said.
He also reiterated his promise to reopen the economy once there are enough doses of Covid-19 vaccines for every Filipino.
“If I see most of the citizens can avail of the vaccine in any of the health centers, hospitals, at wala nang, that is the standard, then I will reopen everything sa ating ekonomiya (in our economy). For now pigil ako sa lalo na mga bata (I cannot reopen the economy, especially for kids),” he said.
The Lawang Bato National High School is a newly built school campus inaugurated by the local government of Valenzuela City in January this year. It has three infrastructures consisting of four-story buildings with a total of 44 classrooms.
On the other hand, the Canumay East National High School used to be part of the Valenzuela National High School and was known as the Valenzuela National High School - Canumay East Annex.
By virtue of Republic Act 10205 passed in 2012, the complex was converted into an independent national high school and has since been called the Canumay East National High School. (PNA)

""The best vaccine is the available vaccines. We have the vaccines offered to you considering the risk you face as medical front-liners, you better grab it,"" Roque said in mixed English and Filipino.

The vaccines, which are part of the 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines, are now placed in a cold storage facility at the regional hospital.
To encourage HCWs to take their first shots of CoronaVac, VSMMC chief Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr. volunteered to lead five other officials in the ceremonial inoculation at the hospital's Center for Behavioral Science Building here.
""Let me reiterate Sec. Roque's words: the available vaccines are those that are already available. I urge my colleagues to be vaccinated (with the CoronaVac),"" Aquino added.
Roque said medical workers can still get other brands if they choose not to take the available vaccines now.
He said Cebu will still get allocations from pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.
The doses of this brand of vaccine from the United Kingdom will still be administered to the priority sector, which means that VSMMC medical officials and staff who would not get CoronaVac will be inoculated with it.

MANILA – Medical professionals of St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City received their first doses of Sinovac vaccines on Thursday and encouraged fellow healthcare workers to do the same.
Dr. Catherine Yu, 51, a physician for about 20 years now, said she decided to get her shot because most of all, she must protect herself from the coronavirus infection.
""I want to set an example to the rest of (the) front-liners, particularly from other hospitals who have hesitation, that getting vaccinated is very important,"" Yu said.
""Ang important kasi (What's important is that) we get ourselves protected in whatever percent, di ba (right)? It's better, even if it's just 50 percent. Fifty percent is still protection than zero, than nothing. I want to encourage everyone to get vaccinated and that's why we are setting an example by being the first ones to get the vaccines ourselves.""
 Protecting community
Meanwhile, Dr. Mary Beth Tanco, 54, said getting vaccinated would not only protect yourself but also those around you.
Tanco shared she felt good even after the vaccination process and is confident that the vaccine would give her enough protection as she continues to serve more patients.
""I think whatever it is, magbibigay pa din ng (it will still give) antibodies yan. I think that will help protect the community,"" Tanco said.

 Protect yourself first
With her exposure to Covid-19 patients, nurse Christine Marie Libo-on, 38, opted to get vaccinated because she wants to make sure her loved ones at home, including three senior citizens and children, are safe from the infection whenever she gets home from hospital duty.
Libo-on was earlier encouraged by a cousin, a nurse in Qatar, that ""any type of protection that you could get, you should get it.”
There's no need to worry about the adverse reaction to the vaccines, she was told, and that people should think more about getting protection because all vaccines have side effects.
""We'll see in the long run what the effects of vaccines would be but I think protection against Covid-19 is much needed,"" Libo-on added.
She likewise urged her fellow healthcare workers to choose to get protected.
""But if you want to wait for other vaccines, then it's your prerogative,"" Libo-on said.

 Protecting loved ones
A 34-year-old nurse, Krismay Carpio, offered the same reason as to why she volunteered to get vaccinated. That is, to protect herself and her family from being infected.
""Kung lahat tayo takot, hindi tayo willing mag-take ng risk, ay walang mangyayari (If we are all afraid and we are not willing to take a risk, then nothing will happen),"" Carpio said.
She said before she decided to get a shot of CoronaVac, she read a lot of journals and articles.
""So dahil nagbasa na ako, medyo na-enlighthen na ako para aware ka. Hindi pwedeng nagpa-vaccine ka lang. Hindi ka nagbabasa (I was enlightened and became aware by reading journals about the vaccine. It's not right to get inoculated without reading about the vaccine),"" she added.
Carpio shared that at the height of the pandemic, it broke her heart to see Covid-19 patients under critical care with poor prognosis.
“I thought, what if the vaccine came early? They would not have to experience it,” she said.
She also urged fellow health workers to think about their families.
""Think that you will be saving your family above yourself since you are exposed to the deadly virus at the hospital,"" Carpio said.

MANILA – The national government will stick to its Covid-19 National Vaccination Plan, Malacañang said Thursday after some ranking government officials, who are not frontline medical workers, reportedly received the Sinovac-made CoronaVac jab.
Under the government’s prioritization list, frontline healthcare workers are supposedly first in line to be administered with the vaccine brand of their choice.
However, some government officials including the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya and Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chief of staff Michael Salalima had already received the CoronaVac shot.
Other officials who received the vaccine are Pasay City Vice Mayor Noel Boyet Del Rosario and Manila Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna-Pangan, who is also a doctor.
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier ordered only three officials -- vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., testing czar Vince Dizon, and MMDA chairperson Benhur Abalos -- to get inoculated to boost confidence in the vaccine.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo was also allowed to receive the CoronaVac jab.
In a Palace press briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Malaya and Salalima, who were both vaccinated at the Pasay City General Hospital on Tuesday, were “prompted” by hospital officials to also receive the CoronaVac vaccine.
“The two naman, in good faith, thought that they were doing the nation a service by having themselves vaccinated kasi nga mataas pa yung tinatawag nating distrust sa bakuna (because there is still high distrust in the vaccines). So upon being prodded and being offered and guided by their desire to increase public confidence in the vaccine, nagpabakuna po sila (they had themselves vaccinated),” he said.
He admitted that the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group’s (iNITAG) strict policy to stick to the prioritization list was “not disseminated properly.”
“Hindi talaga niya alam na hindi na-approve yung gusto namin na mga taong gobyerno ang magpapturok para nga ma-increase po ang vaccine confidence. Dahil nga po ang desisyon naman ng iNITAG na huwag na bakunahan ang iba pang mga tao (He really didn’t know that our proposal to have government officials vaccinated to boost vaccine confidence was not approved. Because of the decision of iNITAG not to vaccinate officials) beyond Secretary Galvez, Secretary Dizon, and Chairman Abalos was not really disseminated properly,” he said.
Roque admitted that there were some “breaches” in the protocol but assured that it is now clear that only frontline healthcare workers are allowed to receive vaccines first.
“Hindi po tayo perfect sa pagpapatupad nitong protocol, nagkaroon tayo ng kakaunting breaches pero we (We’re not perfect when it comes to implementing protocols, there were few breaches but we) have learned from the breaches and now everyone knows medical front-liners muna (first),” he said.
Medical front-liners still the priority
Following the expected arrival of 487,200 doses of United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca vaccines on Thursday night, Roque assured that frontline healthcare workers will still be the first group to receive the vaccines.
The AstraZeneca vaccine will be the second vaccine brand to arrive in the country after China’s Sinovac vaccines arrived last Sunday.
“The only thing I can be sure of is uunahin ang medical front-liners (medical front-liners will still go first). But the iNITAG would have to come up with that protocol. But I suppose they will follow the same protocol priority,” he said.
Earlier, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI) recommended against using the AstraZeneca vaccines in people aged 65 and older.
Roque, however, allayed fears over the safety and efficacy of the UK-manufactured vaccine, noting that no less than the World Health Organization (WHO) has given it clearance for emergency use.
“I don’t think it is something that should be a basis para mag-atubili na naman sa AstraZeneca. Itong AstraZeneca po ay (to have hesitations again about AstraZeneca). This AstraZeneca is) equally as popular as Pfizer,” he said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

AWANG AIRPORT, Maguindanao--At least 4,200 Sinovac vaccines intended for the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao's (BARMM) medical front-liners arrived here Thursday.

The vaccines, which arrived via a Philippine Airlines commercial flight from Manila around 11:55 a.m., represent BARMM's initial allocation of the Chinese-made vaccines from the national government, which will be given to health workers directly involved in handling coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients.

Dr. Amirel Usman, acting BARMM health minister, said the vaccines would be kept overnight at their office’s storage facility before its transport to district hospitals in the region.

“We have prioritized health workers directly treating Covid-19 patients for our vaccination rollout,” Usman told reporters here in an interview.

He said that for the initial vaccine delivery, Maguindanao would get 1,400 vials; Sulu – 1,032; Lanao del Sur – 972; Tawi-Tawi – 518; and Basilan – 278.

“A total of 2,100 hospital workers in Covid-19 facilities in the region are allotted two doses each while the succeeding vaccine deliveries will be for other front-line personnel and vulnerable sectors,” Usman said.

In Maguindanao province, health office chief, Dr. Elizabeth Samama, said they would start the ceremonial inoculation of doctors and nurses at the Maguindanao Provincial Hospital on Friday morning.

Other government hospitals in the province include the Buluan District Hospital, Datu Odin District Hospital, and the Datu Blah District Hospital.

Meanwhile, vaccines intended for the provinces of Lanao del Sur, Basilan, Sulu, and Tawi-Tawi will be transported either by land, airplane, or boat with the help of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the BARMM’s partner in providing emergency food and healthcare to mothers and children in poor areas of the region.

“We will be finalizing plans overnight with the UNICEF people for the fastest way to deliver the vaccines to the other province-components of the region,” Usman said.

He urged the health workers to have themselves vaccinated with Sinovac as it is safe and “halal” or permissive to the Islam faith. The Ministry of Health – BARMM has an estimated 19,000 workforce. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – A total of 2,290 military healthcare workers have so far been inoculated with Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac vaccines since the rollout of the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ (AFP) vaccination drive earlier this week.
Latest data from the AFP showed that as of Thursday, 598 military personnel were vaccinated at the Victoriano Luna Medical Center (VLMC), 583 at the Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo Station Hospital, 349 at the Manila Naval Hospital, 566 at the Philippine Army General Hospital, and 194 at the Philippine Air Force General Hospital.
""I am confident that our front-line personnel will make good use of this opportunity to confidently and safely dispense their duties as we collectively seek an end to this pandemic,"" said AFP chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, in a statement.
The AFP is also conducting a troop information and education (TI & E) program in every camp to address issues, concerns, and apprehension of soldiers about being vaccinated.
The VLMC is also facilitating the program to train and capacitate healthcare personnel for the ongoing vaccination program while information dissemination materials are also provided to military training facilities in unified commands.
With the availability of the Sinovac vaccine in the country, Sobejana reiterated that medical front-liners of the military will be prioritized in the inoculation drive.
“The AFP is grateful to the national government to have our health workers be among the first to receive a Covid-19 vaccine. This gives protection to our military front-liners as they carry out their duties to serve and treat our citizens,” he said.
Sobejana also urged personnel to support the ongoing vaccination program as the military continues to serve at the frontlines in the battle against Covid-19.
“The vaccination program will be our shield that shall aid us in protecting and preserving Filipino lives against the pandemic,” Sobejana said.
Meanwhile, the AFP remains to be on a support role in the government’s vaccine rollout.
A total of 304 medical service personnel already conducted simulation activities in preparation for the vaccination campaign.
There are 72 vaccine teams and 47 vaccination sites in AFP camps with military treatment facilities (MTFs) nationwide.
The AFP is actively working with local government units and Department of Health counterparts where there are no MTFs.
“The AFP remains ready to serve our people in these challenging times. The availability of the vaccines is a welcome development that allows us to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” Sobejana said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

 Cusi directed generation companies to ensure power supply especially in Covid-19 vaccine cold storage facilities and healthcare facilities, with prepared emergency response protocols and continuity plans in cases of power outages.
 Necessary support including installation of backup power supply should be provided in cold storage facilities and healthcare facilities.
 To ensure enough power supply during the inoculation program, the energy chief has ordered to keep generating facilities at the maximum dependable capacity, managing water reservoirs to ensure optimal production of hydroelectric power plants, and securing adequate supply of fuel as well as maintaining reasonable fuel inventories.
 He also reminded industry players to comply with the grid operating and maintenance program for this year.
 “The DOE is working non-stop to establish an uninterrupted supply of electricity services at the onset of the vaccine rollout by the end of first quarter of 2021. We have been meeting with the members of the energy family to fortify our strategies,” Cusi said in a statement Thursday.
 In cases of emergencies and power outages, he urged stakeholders to have backup personnel in power plants and augment maintenance crew to immediately respond to emergencies.
 Cusi added that close coordination with the national and local government is also crucial in ensuring reliable power supply during the immunization program.
 He said security forces could be augmented in major power plants as needed, and industry stakeholders should coordinate with their respective local government unit regarding the locations of cold storage facilities. (PNA)

MANILA – Malacañang fired back Thursday at Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo for branding President Rodrigo Duterte “unpresidential” and “quick-tempered.”
Turning the table on Robredo, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Duterte had launched a verbal tirade against the Vice President because she is “always wrong.”
“Iyan po ay reaksiyon ng Pangulo sa taong laging mali (The President only made a reaction to a person who is always wrong),” Roque said in a virtual presser, referring to Robredo.
Last week, Robredo said coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines from China’s Sinovac Biotech has failed to secure a positive recommendation from the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC), an advisory board that acts as a recommendatory to the Department of Health (DOH) as stipulated under Republic Act 11223 or the Universal Health Care (UHC) law.
Duterte, in a public address delivered Monday, responded to Robredo’s call for a further review of the Sinovac vaccines by HTAC, telling her that the process for the administration of China-made vaccines has already concluded.
The President said he would give Robredo money to procure Covid-19 vaccines for Filipinos.
On Wednesday, Robredo said Duterte sounded unpresidential and quick-tempered when he went on a tirade against her.
Roque, the principal author of the UHC law, reiterated that the HTAC review of Sinovac vaccines is not mandatory.
He said Duterte’s recent jab at Robredo was meant to correct the Vice President.
“Ang konteksto po ng sinasabi ni Presidente na mali na naman si Vice President Robredo, ‘yung sinasabi niya na dapat maghintay ang mga medical front-liner ng HTAC recommendation para magpaturok, eh hindi po kinakailangan iyan (The context of the President’s statement is Vice President Robredo is wrong again when she said medical front-liners should await HTAC recommendation before receiving the vaccine. There’s no need for that),” Roque said.
Roque also explained that Duterte could not refuse to tongue-lash Robredo because the President is determined to protect Filipinos, especially front-liners, amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
“So ‘yun po ‘yung konteksto ng mga pinarating na mensahe ng Presidente dahil hindi po dapat ipagsapalaran ang buhay ng mga front-liner sa panahon ng pandemya (So, that’s the context of the President’s message because he doesn’t want to put front-liners at risk amid the pandemic),” he said.

Survey questions include the number of persons in the household; preferred vaccine; and health conditions including allergies, comorbidities, and if the person had been afflicted with Covid-19.
On Monday, the city government started to conduct an online survey and registration for Covid-19 inoculation.
The online survey can be browsed at the official website of the Angeles City Government (angelescity.gov.ph), as well as on the Facebook page of City Information Office Angeles City.

In a separate interview, she said that they are waiting for the final details regarding the arrival of the vaccines in Western Visayas. (Photo screenshot from Isyung Bakuna forum)
ILOILO CITY – The Department of Health (DOH) Regional Office in Western Visayas is still waiting for the final details on the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines expected either on Thursday or Friday.
In a phone interview, Dr. Mary Jane Roches Juanico, head of the DOH WV Center for Health Development (DOH WV CHD) infectious disease cluster, said six Covid-19 referral hospitals have been identified as recipients of the China-donated vaccines.
Western Visayas was allocated 8,438 doses out of the 600,000 donated vaccines that arrived in the Philippines on Feb. 28.
The allocation will be divided among recipient hospitals based on their actual number of employees who already have given their consent to be vaccinated. To be covered are the medical staff, health workers, and other employees.
The recipient hospitals are Western Visayas Medical Center, West Visayas State University Medical Center, Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital, Riverside Medical Center, St. Paul Hospital, and Iloilo Doctor’s Hospital.
Juanico said they are also preparing a quick substitution list to make sure that no vaccine will be wasted in case some would refuse to be vaccinated.
“This is not mandatory but rather a voluntary vaccination,” she clarified.
A resurvey is currently being conducted because they have previously prepared for AstraZeneca and not for Sinovac.
Initially, it looked like the target recipients are also amenable to the Sinovac vaccine, she added.
Juanico said they will immediately start the immunization once the vaccines are here.
Meantime, in a virtual forum “Isyung Bakuna” hosted by DOH-6 and the Philippine Information Agency, Juanico said in general, people who are eligible to get vaccinated, should always grab the opportunity whenever there are free vaccines for their protection and their families as well.
“Vaccination is really important. Every opportunity that the government gives for a free vaccination is really a chance of having an extended life because we are really protected from infectious diseases,” she said.

(PNA Bacolod file photo)
BACOLOD CITY – Stakeholders of the sugar industry are negotiating for the procurement of Covovax, a vaccine developed by Novavax Inc. and distributed locally by Faberco Life Sciences Inc., to initiate a mass inoculation program against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
In a statement on Thursday, Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) Board Member Emilio Bernardino Yulo said SRA officials along with millers, sugar federations, planters, and local government units (LGUs) in sugar-producing areas are in talks with the Covovax distributors.
They are working on how to directly secure slots from the 30 million doses initially reserved for the Philippine government, he added.
“We are now in exploratory talks with the makers of Covovax and our next step is to reach out to sugar federations all over the country as well as to LGUs to speed up this process so we can help jumpstart the economy which will also be good for the industry,” Yulo, who hails from Negros Occidental and the representative of the planters’ sector in the SRA Board, said.
He pointed out that the sugar industry needs to support mass vaccination to protect its stakeholders and to allow industries heavily using sugar to also go back to normalcy.
“Tourism, restaurants, schools that are heavily affected by the pandemic are among our biggest consumers and the soonest we can go back to normalcy through mass vaccination, the better it is for the industry and for our economy,” Yulo said.
Sugar industry leaders were briefed by distributors of Covovax in a recent virtual conference facilitated by Yulo, fellow SRA Board Member Roland Beltran, who represents the millers’ sector, and multi-sectoral alliance Tatak Kalamay.
“Tatak Kalamay, which has a membership in almost all sugar-producing areas, will be mobilized in the vaccination campaign,” Yulo said.
He added that it is interesting that in the clinical trials for Covovax, the special group of the immunocompromised group and the older population from 65-84 years old has been included.
“It is also reasonably priced with an indicative price plus estimated logistical costs to Bacolod at PHP1,400 for two doses,” he added.
Vaccine distributors are looking at a mass rollout by the third quarter of the year, but are hoping that they will be able to distribute Covovax by June or July in the Philippines, Yulo said.
Some 1.2 billion doses of Covovax are expected to be produced by the Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer. (PNA)

""Yung global supply talaga ay kulang. May shortage kaya naantala madalas ang delivery (The global supply is very limited. There's a supply shortage that's why the delivery of vaccines is often delayed),"" Duque said during the symbolic vaccination rollout at the St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City on Wednesday afternoon.

During the event, Duque cited the huge contribution of the private sector in the country's fight against the pandemic.

The statement comes following a study that showed AstraZeneca shots offer as little as 10 percent protection against the B.1.351 variant, which was first detected in South Africa.

""No matter what the publications will say bumaba nang ganitong efficacy, hangga't wala tayong certainty (whether it has lesser efficacy, as long as we have no certainty) we will continue to use the vaccine,"" she added.

The Philippines is set to receive on Thursday night some 487,200 vials of AstraZeneca’s vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) under the COVAX Facility.
The doses from this batch were developed in South Korea and were donated by Germany, the European Union, Norway, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, and Greece.
The vaccines will be coming from Belgium, stopping over at Bangkok before the arrival in the Philippines. From Villamor Air Base, the delivery will be transported to Metropac Logistics in Marikina City.

MANILA – Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles on Thursday raised the possibility that the entire Philippines might be placed under the least restrictive modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) by the second quarter of 2021.
Nograles said President Rodrigo Duterte might be convinced to impose the most relaxed quarantine status nationwide by April, considering that the country already has over 2 million coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines by that month.
“Unless he (Duterte) sees about 2 million vaccines being rolled out as a start, then that’s when he will start reconsidering about itong pagbubukas, more openly ng ating GCQ areas (opening more sectors in GCQ areas by) putting it under MGCQ,” he said in an online press briefing.
Duterte earlier rejected the proposal of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases and Metro Manila mayors to impose a nationwide MGCQ in March.
During the arrival of the initial 600,000 doses of China-donated Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccine on Sunday, Duterte said he would place the entire country under MGCQ as soon as it secures enough vaccines.
Around 525,600 doses of Covid-19 shots developed by the United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca are also set to arrive in the country on Thursday night.
Nograles said the country is also expected to receive another 1 million doses of Sinovac vaccine this month.
“That means by March, we will have almost 2 million. And then that ends our first quarter. Hopefully, we can get even more,” he said. “By second quarter, we will have more than 2 million [vials already]. Baka ‘yun ‘yung indicative timeline na sinasabi ni Pangulo (Perhaps, that’s the indicative timeline the President is saying),” he said.
Duterte is “very happy” with the vaccine rollout, giving him “more confidence” to reconsider the proposed nationwide shift to MGCQ, Nograles said.
“So, I foresee this to be something in the works. Sa second quarter po, baka ito na ang tamang panahon na mag-shift na tayo sa MGCQ para sa buong Pilipinas (Perhaps, the second quarter is the right time for the proposed shift to MGCQ for the entire Philippines),” he said.
Metro Manila, Apayao, Baguio City, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Batangas, Tacloban City, Iligan City, Davao City, and Lanao del Sur have been placed under the stricter general community quarantine (GCQ) until March 31.
The rest of the country is already under MGCQ. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – The Philippines must adhere to the vaccine prioritization of medical front-liners, seniors, and those with comorbidities to ensure unhampered supply from the COVAX Facility, the World Health Organization (WHO) reminded Thursday.
Around 4.58 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses are expected to arrive in the Philippines within the year under COVAX Facility.
The country is also set to receive some 117,000 Pfizer-BioNTech jabs and an additional batch, the figures of which would be announced by end of March 2021.
""To access these vaccines, WHO and the COVAX Facility, and that includes its donor partners and members, have emphasized that COVAX vaccines should be used according to the prioritizations,"" WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said in a virtual presser, adding Manila must also demonstrate that it can roll out the vaccines in an efficient manner while minimizing wastage.
The prioritized groups he mentioned include some 1.8 million Filipino healthcare workers who are among the most at risk in the still-raging pandemic.
This is followed by the most vulnerable population -- the elderly and those suffering from comorbidities, where high case fatality rates were previously recorded.
“If we cannot demonstrate that we are following this prioritization, unfortunately, the COVAX may have to consider other options where the impact of the vaccine rollout will be more useful and practical and will contribute to saving more lives,” Abeyasinghe said.
""So we urge everybody concerned to kindly respect the prioritization that has been defined by the DOH (Department of Health) and the NITAG (National Immunization Technical Advisory Group) in consultation with the WHO,"" he added.
The WHO will not police the list, leaving the role of ensuring adherence to the DOH, he said.
In the same briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire acknowledged the conditions set by the COVAX Facility to align with WHO's objective to give the shots ""to those who needed the most -- the healthcare workers"".
She urged the public and all stakeholders to stay within the inoculation framework.
“Kung saka-sakaling makapag-violate tayo nitong objective na 'to, na hindi natin nabigay doon sa mga tamang tao o health workers, maaaring ma-compromise or ma-jeopardize 'yong mga succeeding supplies from coming from COVAX Facility,” she said. (PNA)

MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte has stood pat on his statement that the government will not force Filipinos to get inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine, a Palace official said Thursday.
Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles made this remark after a group of labor unions expressed concern over an “emerging” policy of some businesses requiring their workers to get vaccinated against Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to work.
China’s donated 600,000 doses of Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines is the only vaccine brand currently available in the country. However, a number of frontline medical workers have refused to be injected with CoronaVac over efficacy doubts.
The government aims to inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos nationwide, but it is not making inoculation against Covid-19 mandatory.
“Walang pilitan para kay Pangulong Duterte. Although talagang ini-encourage niya at ini-encourage ng buong gobyerno ang lahat ng mga kababayan natin na pagdating ng takdang oras na kayo na rin po ay susunod sa linya na nga po ng magpapabakunahan, tanggapin po natin ito ng buong loob at walang pag-aalinlangan (The President won’t force anyone. Although he and the entire government is encouraging the public to accept the vaccine without hesitation when the time comes that they are next in line to receive the vaccine),” Nograles said in a virtual presser.
He expressed confidence that there would be higher trust and acceptance for Covid-19 vaccines as soon as more frontline healthcare workers receive their shots.
“Sa una nga po may mga agam-agam pa maging sa health and medical sector po natin. Hindi naman po lahat ng mga healthcare workers on day one ay agad na pumayag pero habang nagro-rollout ng vaccine, at naumpisahan na nga po, ay tumataas din 'yung kumpiyansa ng ating mga healthcare workers (In the beginning, healthcare workers had doubts. Not all healthcare workers would agree to get inoculated on day one, but as the vaccine rollout continues, their confidence has started to increase),” he said.
More hospitals, including private hospitals, have reached out to request Covid-19 vaccine allocation, Nograles said.
“So ibig pong sabihin maging 'yung demand for the vaccines nung Sinovac ay naging mataas na maging sa mga healthcare workers so ganun din po ang mangyayari for the rest of the population (So this means that the demand for Sinovac has increased and that will also happen for the rest of the population),” he said.
Earlier, Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said he is set to issue an order prohibiting Covid-19 vaccinations as a requirement for returning to work.
The “no vaccination, no work” policy enforced by any company or employer is illegal, he said.
He warned companies against enforcing such a policy, stressing that they could be held liable under the law if they fire or suspend an employee who refuses inoculation against Covid-19. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – The government will let the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG) decide on the vaccination of senior citizens and Cabinet members, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Thursday.
“We will leave it to NITAG to give us [its] recommendations in terms of anong brand ng vaccine ang puwedeng gamitin sa anong sector ng population, maging ‘yung sa prioritization ng sectors ng population (the brand of vaccine that can be administered to a specific sector of the population, and the prioritization of sectors of population),” Nograles said in a virtual presser.
Nograles issued the statement, as he acknowledged that the CoronaVac vaccine manufactured by China’s Sinovac Biotech could only be administered to people aged 18 to 59.
The Philippines on Monday kicked off its coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccination campaign by giving the first shots of CoronaVac vaccine to some frontline healthcare workers and top government officials.
Results of clinical trials found that Sinovac has a 91.2-percent efficacy rate among clinically healthy individuals belonging to the 18- to 59-year age group.
However, Sinovac only has a 50.4-percent efficacy rate among medical front-liners exposed to Covid-19.
Nograles said iNITAG’s decision is not to use Sinovac vaccines on senior citizens.
Nograles said the government would await iNITAG’s decision whether Covid-19 vaccines made by the United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca could be administered to people aged 65 and above.
“Wala naman pong limitation sa edad ang AstraZeneca vaccine. So we will await the advice of NITAG in terms of saan gagamitin itong AstraZeneca vaccines, kung ito ba ay gagamitin natin sa senior citizens (AstraZeneca vaccine can be used with no age limitation. So we will await the advice of NITAG in terms of administration of AstraZeneca vaccines, whether it could be administered to senior citizens),” he said.
The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases IATF-EID, upon the recommendation of iNITAG and the Health department’s Technical Advisory Group, has authorized the administration of Sinovac vaccines to frontline medical workers despite results of the clinical trials.
The iNITAG, on the other hand, has thumbed down the IATF-EID’s proposal to reserve vaccine shots for around 50 “influencers” to boost public confidence in Covid-19 vaccines.
The influencers included Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque and his fellow Cabinet officials, other lawmakers, media personalities, and movie personalities.
The iNITAG has only allowed the priority vaccination of National Task Force Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., testing czar Vivencio Dizon, and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief Benjamin Abalos Jr. who all got inoculated last Monday.
Cabinet members are front-liners too
Nograles said the IATF-EID would ask the iNITAG to reconsider its decision on reserving vaccine shots for Cabinet officials.
He made the statement after President Rodrigo Duterte, during the Cabinet meeting held Monday, sought the inoculation of his Cabinet.
Nograles said Duterte wants Cabinet secretaries to receive vaccine jabs since they are also “frontline workers” who have a high risk of catching Covid-19.
“To the President’s mind and concern, I believe, is that he considers us in the Cabinet as also frontline workers and very much exposed also,” he said.
Nograles said Duterte raised worry over the safety of the Cabinet officials.
“We’ll refer the matter to the NITAG and ask for them to consider, looking at the possibility na kung maaari, ‘yung mga Cabinet members, lalung-lalo ‘yung mga pinaka-exposed, might be able to get inoculated as well (We’ll refer the matter to the NITAG and ask for them to consider, looking at the possibility of allowing Cabinet members, especially those who are most exposed, to get inoculated as well),” he said.

So in terms of bottlenecks, wala naman kaming nakikitang (we do not see any) bottlenecks,” he said.
According to Nograles, the national government has also instructed hospitals to immediately start administering Covid-19 vaccine doses sans fanfare.
“In fact ang (the) instruction nga po (is) as soon as it is delivered to already begin the inoculation and vaccination process. Do not wait anymore for us. 'Yung pagpupunta lang namin sa mga hospital, nagkakaroon tayo ng mga seremonyas ay those are just ceremonial kumbaga vaccinations (Us going to the hospitals are just ceremonial vaccinations),” he said.

MANILA – Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Wednesday called on retired military and uniformed personnel (MUP) who have raised concerns about their 2018 pension differentials to be patient as the government needs to prioritize funding for its coronavirus disease (Covid-19) response.
Lorenzana made the call amid the controversy surrounding the PHP20 billion slashed from the Pension and Gratuity Fund (PGF) for retired uniformed personnel under the 2021 General Appropriations Act.
In an interview during his courtesy call to Speaker Lord Allan Velasco at the House of Representatives, Lorenzana said he believes “there’s no harm done” with the delay in the payment of 2018 pension differentials to retired MUP.
“Ito lang po ang paalala natin sa pensioners na nagde-demand na makuha na ‘yung arrears ng 2018 na kung pwede lang po sana ay maghintay lang tayo ng konting panahon dahil ‘yung pera kinain ng Covid at marami tayong pagkakagastusan dito. Bibili pa tayo ng vaccines so baka hindi kayanin (Our reminder to our pensioners who are demanding to get their arrears for 2018 is to wait for a while because the funding was diverted for Covid and we have a lot of expenses for this. We still have to purchase vaccines so [the budget] might not even be enough),” Lorenzana said.
Lorenzana said the government is not backing away from its obligation, and pensioners can help by being patient in waiting for their pension arrears.
“Huwag nating pilitin ang gobyerno na mangutang para ibayad sa inyo. Anyway, dinoble naman ang pension ninyo since 2018, except ‘yung four months—January to April—so palagay ko hindi kayo mahihirapan (Let’s not force the government to borrow money just to pay you. Anyway, your pension was doubled since 2018, except for four months--January to April--so I think you won’t have a hard time),” he said.
The Department of Budget and Management had originally proposed PHP172.9 billion under the PGF to partially fund the payment of the 2018 pension differences for MUP.
However, in the final version of the 2021 GAA, the amount was reduced to PHP152.9 billion or a difference of PHP20 billion, thus affecting the payment of the 2018 pension differentials.
House Committee on Appropriations chair Eric yap said the PHP20 billion was a buffer fund, which the DBM and the legislature all agreed to realign in favor of budget items meant to address the coronavirus pandemic, including the procurement of vaccines and personal protective equipment of medical front-liners.
Yap said he would file a PHP50-billion supplemental budget to help absorb the fund deficiency brought about by the PHP70-billion budget cut made by the previous House leadership in the 2020 budget.
Deputy Speaker Isidro Ungab also manifested that the 2020 national budget had several realignments, confirming that the PGF was then slashed by PHP74.029 billion by former House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and former Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte.
Ungab chaired the House Committee on Appropriations during Cayetano’s term as Speaker.
Meanwhile, Anakalusugan Party-list Rep. Mike Defensor disputed Yap’s claim that the PHP20 billion in military and police retirees’ pension money was diverted to Covid-19 vaccine procurement.
“To set the record straight, the vaccine procurement fund approved by Congress, as recommended by the bicameral conference committee (bicam) and carried in the 2021 budget, was PHP2.5 billion, which is good for just a few thousand doses and which was the amount recommended by the executive branch at the beginning of the pandemic,” he said.
Defensor noted that PHP2.5 billion is the amount that is “sure of funding,” as it is part of the “programmed” portion of the 2021 national budget.
He said Congress allocated an additional PHP172 billion but lodged it in the “unprogrammed” part of the outlay, which means it is available only if there is excess revenue, there is a new tax measure as funding source, or there are loans.
“Through the bicam, Congress juggled at least PHP182 billion in appropriations recommended by President (Rodrigo) Duterte in his version of the budget. None of that, not even a centavo or peso, was added by the two chambers to the Palace-recommended PHP2.5-billion vaccine procurement fund,” he said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

LAPU-LAPU CITY, Cebu – The Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH-7) on Wednesday conducted a coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccination simulation in this island city.
DOH-7 chief pathologist Dr. Mary Jean Loreche said the activity which she personally supervised was designed to prepare the community for the Covid-19 inoculation program.
Mayor Junard Chan received a dose of “saline solution” during the mock vaccination procedure.
He said he volunteered to lead the dry run “to show to the residents in Lapu-Lapu City that we are ready in case the vaccines arrive”.  
“I showed to the people that I presented myself to be the first to receive the vaccine so that they can see that it is safe to be inoculated and they have nothing to worry about. We are happy to know that we can now make ourselves stronger against Covid-19,” Chan told the Philippine News Agency in an interview.
The mayor started the simulation by signing an informed consent form before he underwent pre-inoculation screening and taking of vital signs.
Loreche, who is also the regional Covid-19 spokesperson, said informed consent is needed before a patient can get the Covid-19 vaccine dose.
“Part of the process for the vaccination, there is an informed consent. It is a document whereby the vaccinee, after being counseled, shall sign his/her consent to the vaccination,” she told newsmen.
The doctor assigned also conducted a mock interview on Chan, asking him if he had experienced fever, dry cough, headache, cold, sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pain, among other symptoms of Covid-19, in the last 14 days.
After getting the ""shot"", the mayor subjected himself to tedious medical preliminaries.
In the ""post-inoculation"" interview, Chan was asked if he felt any adverse effects.
Loreche said Chan was actually injected with a “saline solution”, a placebo that will not affect the body, and denied reports that the mayor was injected with the CoronaVac vaccine.
“Vaccine is very important for Lapu-Lapu City because we are a tourism city. We work hard to recover as our economy is very dependent on tourists,” Chan said. (PNA)

As part of the preparation, the city government will set up a cold room at the Government Center Annex Building and will purchase mobile cold storage units to protect the shelf life of Covid-19 vaccines.

COTABATO CITY – Health authorities in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) said the region is sure to receive vaccines against Covid-19 certified as “halal” or permissible to the Islam faith.

Dr. Amirel Usman, acting head of the BARMM health office, said Muslims prefer ""halal"" vaccines under Islam. “We want it to be halal,” Usman told the Philippine News Agency in a telephone interview on Wednesday.

“However, the Islamic body may allow the use of any vaccines since it is a human health necessity and for health protection,” he added.

Usman said there was an assurance from the Department of Health central office that BARMM is assured of “CoronaVac,” a vaccine manufactured by the Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac.

“I was told that ‘halal’ vaccines have arrived in the country. We are just waiting for its distribution to BARMM,” Usman added.

He noted that Sinovac is ""halal"" as certified by the Indonesian halal certification body, while the Philippine halal certification board can certify AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines once they are made available in the Philippines.

He said the Ministry of Health-BARMM has embarked on a massive information drive to educate the Bangsamoro people that the anti-Covid vaccines are safe and halal.

“We need to educate our people so they will not resist vaccination like all other our vaccination programs, which were welcomed by the people,” Usman said, adding that the region is ready and storage facilities for the vaccines are in place.

He said there is no specific date yet on the arrival of vaccines and the date of mass vaccination in the BARMM.

The BARMM comprises the cities of Cotabato, Lamitan, and Marawi; the provinces of Maguindanao, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Lanao del Sur, and Basilan; and also the 63 villages in six towns of North Cotabato province. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

DAVAO CITY – As the first shipment of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine doses arrived in the country on February 28, a City Council member underscored the importance of running a parallel education and information program to boost public confidence in the safety and efficacy of the vaccines.

In a statement on Wednesday, Councilor Pamela Librado said education and information campaigns, such as surveys conducted in schools, communities, and other sectors, must be intensified to change people's mindset towards vaccines.

“Given that vaccine hesitancy and declining confidence in vaccines have been brought about by politically-motivated controversies, it is now critical to reverse this hesitancy, educate people on the available Covid-19 vaccines, and provide relevant materials and updates on the issue,” Librado said.

Families and communities, she said, must also be assisted in making an informed choice on being vaccinated.

""The correct information can save many people; it can lead to the full recovery of our City and our country,"" Librado said, calling on the government and the media to collaborate.

Similarly, she also urged individuals and organizations to exercise restraint when spreading information regarding vaccines.

""We have the burden of checking the sources and ensuring we do not become purveyors of misinformation. We hope that those who are spreading fake news will stop for the people not to get confused,"" Librado said.

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, Covid-19 vaccines are highly effective in preventing Covid-19; at the very least, vaccines can keep a person from seriously getting ill if they do get the virus.

""Let us get it straight to the point. We need effective, safe, and publicly-available vaccines to put an end to this pandemic so that we may be able to recover and move forward,"" she said.

Local health authorities are set to start administering vaccines on medical front-liners beginning Friday following the arrival of 12,000 vials of Sinovac vaccines on Tuesday. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

In a media forum, House Committee on Health Chair Angelina Tan said the vaccination challenge is to persuade Filipinos to take the Covid-19 vaccine.
Tan said if there are only a ‘few takers” because of existing doubts and uncertainty about the vaccine, then the goal to achieve herd immunity through vaccination won’t happen.
“Since day one, I think naging maayos po ‘yung pag rollout ng ating National Vaccination Program. Maganda ‘yung proseso. Siguro lang, nabigyan ko na rin naman ng diin ito sa DOH, na paigtingin pa nila ‘yung pagpapaliwanag sa ibaba katulong ang local government units (Since day one, I think the rollout of our national vaccination program has been smooth. The process was good. The only thing that needs to be improved on --which I already stressed to the DOH -- is how they could convince the grassroots to take it with the help of local government units,” Tan said.
Tan said while she understands the apprehensions of some health care workers on the Chinese vaccine because of the recommendations of the Food and Drug Association (FDA), she encouraged them to read on the studies and published data on CoronaVac.
She, however, noted that vaccination is voluntary and that health workers will not be forced to be inoculated.
“Pag sinabi nilang ‘no’ and they are willing to wait, ginagalang naman iyon (But if they said ‘no and they are willing to wait, then we respect that),” she said.

Arjohn Gangoso, health education and promotion officer of the Department of Health (DOH) 12, said Wednesday the target individuals are all workers of 23 Covid-19 referral hospitals in the region who were identified as priorities for the vaccine rollout.
Gangoso said they have been waiting for the final schedule of the delivery of the CoronaVac vaccines, within the week.
A team from the DOH-12 is assessing the readiness of the referral hospitals in conducting the vaccination, he said.
“We will immediately start the inoculation once the vaccines arrive,” Gangoso said in a briefing for government communicators and information officers in Koronadal City.
The vaccines, he said, would be delivered directly to the DOH-12 office in Cotabato City, which has a standby cold storage facility, and transferred later on to the provinces and cities in preparation for their distribution to the Covid-19 referral hospitals.
The 23 referral facilities include private, local government-support as well as DOH-run and retained hospitals in the area, among them the Cotabato Regional Medical Center in Cotabato City and the Cotabato Sanitarium in Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao.
Gangoso said workers of the referral hospitals were identified as top priority due to their high-risk exposure to the virus.
Citing their records as of March 1, he said a total of 8,705 health workers from the referral hospitals were identified in the master list as eligible to get the vaccines.
However, he said, they expect the number to increase as some health workers were not included in the initial list.
Gangoso reiterated that the vaccination would be voluntary and the eligible health workers would be required to signify formally if they want to be included in the upcoming rollout.
He acknowledged that some health workers are still hesitant to get the CoronaVac vaccine but the majority has signified to be vaccinated. (PNA)

ZAMBOANGA CITY – A negative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test result remains a requirement in traveling to this city, Mayor Maria Isabelle Climaco-Salazar said Wednesday.

Salazar issued Executive Order 262, setting the local coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) guidelines for interzonal and intrazonal movement of persons in line with the synchronized travel protocols ordered nationwide by the national Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases.

Under the new travel guidelines, documents such as travel authority, medical certificate, and coordination pass have been scrapped -- except for the RT-PCR negative test result.

Salazar said this city strictly requires all inbound travelers to submit a negative RT-PCR result upon entry due to the unabated Covid-19 cases.

The local Covid-19 tracker showed that there are 4,168 confirmed cases in this city as of March 1.

Of the total confirmed cases, 48 are active cases as there are 3,931 recorded recoveries and 189 deaths.

Meanwhile, Section 3 of EO 626 requires minimum public health standards, such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and the wearing of a face mask and face shield.

Salazar said the ""added protection of the Covid-19 vaccine would bring us one step closer to resuming a more normal life.""

Vaccination, coupled with mask-wearing, hand washing, and physical distancing ""will not only save more Filipinos from Covid-19, but it will also allow us to resume work and other activities safely,"" she added. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

The main equities index rose by 0.34 percent, or 23.22 points, to 6,942.76 points.
All Shares tracked the main gauge after it rose by 0.16 percent, or 6.84 points, to 4,186.76 points.
However, most of the sectoral indexes ended the day on the red namely Mining and Oil, 0.76 percent; Services, 0.33 percent; Industrial, 0.22 percent; and Property, 0.15 percent.
Meanwhile, Holding Firms rose by 0.73 percent and Financials by 0.69 percent.
Volume totaled 221.53 billion shares amounting to PHP34.09 billion.
Decliners led advancers at 125 to 101 while 40 shares were unchanged.
“Local shares closed higher as investors continued to bargain hunt with regional markets experiencing some weakness,” Luis Limlingan, Regina Capital Development Corporation head of sales, said.
He also cited the drop in US stocks on Tuesday, spearheaded by tech companies, “as the market pulled back from the previous session’s strong gains.”
“Others are waiting for the results of the OPEC+ meeting where producers are expected to ease supply curbs as economies start to slowly recover from the coronavirus crisis,” she added.
Relatively, the peso stayed firm against the US dollar after closing the day at 48.48 from its 48.565 finish a day ago.
Its closing level is the local unit’s opening level also for the day, which, in turn, is better than the previous session’s 48.58.
Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said the peso closed the day at its strongest in more than a week or since February 19 but this level is among its weakest in four months.
He attributed the peso’s steady performance Wednesday to “the surprise announcement on the arrival of 487,200 AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses tomorrow, March 4.”
He also said the last day of the government’s three-year retail treasury bond (RTB) offering on Thursday “would entail some foreign buyers/investors, thereby could bring in some US dollar inflows soon.”
Other factors that supported the peso during the day included the “downward correction in global oil prices to new 1-week lows” and the continued improvement of the PSEi, he said.
He expects the peso to range between 48.40 and 48.55 on Thursday. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

CEBU CITY – The Vaccine Operations Center (VOC) is eyeing three malls here as vaccination sites once the mass inoculation activity kicks off in this city.
Lawyer Floro Casas Jr., Cebu City administrator, said in a press briefing on Wednesday the management of the malls have offered spaces to be used as vaccination venues.
The city is intensifying its preparation for the mass vaccination following the arrival of initial batch of vaccines on Tuesday and the additional doses expected to arrive in the coming weeks.
Casas told the media that operators of these malls have been communicating with the local government, without citing a final plan.
He also noted that the VOC is in talks with churches, schools and gyms to be used as vaccination centers.
“We need convenient sites because those who will be vaccinated need to stay for a while for observation on the effect of the vaccine to the body,” the official said in Cebuano. “That’s why we are making sure to find comfortable places.”
Mayor Edgardo Labella said the VOC, which is run by the Vaccine Board, has been conducting a survey among the healthcare workers here to identify those who are willing to be administered with the already available vaccines.
“Even now, they (VOC) continue preparing for the vaccination sites and ensuring the smooth implementation of the vaccination program,” the mayor said in the local dialect.
The government-run Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) is set to conduct a ceremonial vaccination to its healthcare workers on Thursday.
Cebu received on Tuesday the initial 7,200 doses of the Sinovac vaccines donated by the Chinese government.
Labella said the healthcare workers in the city will be given the freedom to choose which vaccine brand they want to receive.

In an interview with Radio Mindanao Network, Roque said the proposal to inoculate around 50 influencers ahead of other Filipinos was rejected since the Philippines only has a limited supply of Covid-19 vaccines.
“Siguro kasi 600,000 pa lang ang dumarating eh hindi pa po pinayagan. Pero tingnan po natin. Baka naman kapag dumating na ang mas maraming supply, baka matuloy pa rin po ‘yung ating proposal (Perhaps, it was not allowed because we only have 600,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine. But let’s see. Our proposal might be approved, once we receive more supply),” Roque said.
The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases earlier proposed to reserve vaccine shots for influencers to boost public confidence in vaccines.
The influencers, Roque said on Tuesday, included him and other government officials, media personalities, and movie personalities.
However, the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG) rejected the proposal, saying the vaccines must be given to frontline healthcare workers.
The iNITAG only approved the priority vaccination of Covid-19 vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., Covid-19 testing czar Vivencio Dizon, and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chief Banjamin Abalos Jr.
Galvez, Dizon, and Abalos were all vaccinated on Monday, the first day of the government’s free immunization drive.
It was President Rodrigo Duterte who ordered Galvez and Dizon to receive the vaccine shots, while Abalos represented all Manila mayors.
Roque said the IATF-EID has yet to identify the influencers who will be included in the government’s Covid-19 vaccination priority list.
“Hindi pa naman alam kung [sinu]-sino iyon. Para lang ‘yung mga personalidad na sa tingin namin kapag nabakunahan ay makakatulong sa pagtaas ng kumpiyansa ‘no (We have yet to identify the other influencers. They may be those personalities who we think can help boost public confidence in vaccines),” he said.
The Philippines kicked off its mass Covid-19 vaccination drive on Monday, a day after receiving China-donated 600,000 doses of CoronaVac vaccine developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm, Sinovac Biotech.
The first day of the government’s national Covid-19 vaccination program turned out to be “very successful,” Roque said on Tuesday.

“As soon as the vaccines are delivered to the intended hospital, it would start the vaccination procedures,” she said.
The DOH-Bicol, according to Ang-Bon, is prepared for any possible reactions or side effects that will be experienced by those who will receive the vaccine.
“There are people who are afraid of needles that's why before they were vaccinated they are a little bit scared then after the vaccination they feel relieved that they body reacts, we called it immunization anxiety vaccination reaction,” she said.

MANILA – Malacañang on Wednesday assured that there would be a continuous arrival of more Sinovac-made Covid-19 vaccine doses this month.
On Monday, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said 1 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac will arrive this March under a PHP700-million purchase deal.
This is expected to boost the country’s initial stock of 600,000 doses of the same brand donated by Beijing.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque expressed optimism that the Sinovac-made vaccines will arrive as scheduled.
“Tuluy-tuloy na po iyan dahil may inaasahan po tayong isang milyon galing po sa Sinovac, ito na po iyong bibilhin natin (The arrival is continuous because we expect 1 million from Sinovac, this is what we’re going to purchase),” he said in a radio interview.

The country was supposed to receive some 525,600 doses AstraZeneca vaccines under COVAX Facility, a World Health Organization (WHO)-led mechanism to ensure fair vaccine access, especially for low to middle-income countries.
“So sa tingin ko po hindi na maaantala ito at pagdating po ng Abril eh diyan naman po sisipa iyong marami rin nating nabili rin ‘no (So I think there won’t be any more delays and in April that’s when the bulk of the vaccine doses we purchased will come in),” he said.

MANILA – Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque issued clarification on Wednesday about his recent statement that Filipinos have been on vacation for nearly a year due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.
This, after Roque drew flak from the public after he defended President Rodrigo Duterte’s earlier decision to reclassify this year’s Nov. 2 (All Souls’ Day), December 24 (Christmas Eve), and December 31 (Last Day of the Year) as special working days.
Roque, in a virtual presser on Tuesday, said Duterte had revised the classification of the three public holidays to enable the country to recover “lost time” since it has been on “vacation” mode for almost a year.
“Halos isang taon na tayong nagbakasyon dahil sa Covid-19. Siguro naman po ngayong nandito na ang bakuna, hayaan naman nating maka-recover tayo for lost time ‘no (We have been on vacation for nearly a year because of Covid-19. Perhaps, we need to recover for lost time now that the vaccine is here),” he said.
After the backlash, Roque clarified that his “vacation” comment was only meant to give emphasis to Filipinos’ unemployment since the pandemic broke out.
“Ang konteksto lang nito, talagang maraming tao ang hindi nakapaghanapbuhay dahil dito sa pandemiyang ito. Kaya nga ninanais ng economic team na makahabol naman tayo (The context of this is many people were unable to work because of the pandemic. The economic team wants us to catch up),” he said.
Roque said Filipinos should grab the chance to earn and work following the reopening of the Philippine economy.
“Hindi naman po talaga bakasyon 'yan, kung hindi, hindi nakapagtatrabaho. Kaya ngayon na pupuwede na po tayong makapagtrabaho sana dahil nagbubukas na tayo ng ekonomiya, hayaan naman nating kumita at makapagtrabaho ang ating mga kababayan (That is not really a vacation but rather failure to earn a living. So now that we can resume work because we’re reopening the economy, let us allow our countrymen to earn and work),” he said.
November 2 (Tuesday), December 24 (Friday) and December 31 (Friday) were initially declared as special non-working days.
However, Duterte on Feb. 26 signed Proclamation 1107, declaring the three traditional holidays as special working days to boost economic productivity in the country amid the Covid-19 pandemic.
Duterte, in his Proclamation 1107, stressed the need to minimize work disruption by commemorating some special holidays as special working days instead.
On Feb.1, Duterte said the Philippines is losing PHP2 billion a day due to Covid-19. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Malacañang on Wednesday (March 3) said Duterte might visit China before his term ends in June 2022. (Presidential photo by King Rodriguez)
MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte might visit China before his term ends to personally thank Chinese President Xi Jinping for the 600,000 doses of Sinovac-made CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccines donated to the Philippines, Malacañang said on Wednesday.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made this clarification after Duterte, in a speech on Sunday, said he intends to visit Beijing “maybe at the end of the year when everything has settled down.”
Roque admitted that he was unsure of what the President meant, but assumed that it would be before Duterte steps down in June 2022.
“Hindi po natin alam pero siguro po bago matapos ang termino sa 2022 (We don’t know but perhaps before his term ends in 2022),” Roque said in a radio interview.
He said Duterte was really determined to express gratitude to Xi, noting that the Philippines and China continue to have a strong bilateral relationship during his term.
“Siyempre, bago siya magpaalam sa government service eh nais din nga niyang makarating ng Tsina para magpasalamat po kay President Xi (Of course, before he says goodbye to government service, he wants to visit China and thank President Xi),” he said.
On Sunday, the Philippines welcomed China’s donated 600,000 doses of Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines, the first vaccines to arrive in the country.
Duterte attended the arrival ceremony for the vaccines which are meant for frontline medical workers and uniformed personnel.
In his speech, Duterte told Chinese Ambassador to Manila Huang Xilian that he wanted to thank Xi for making possible the delivery of the first Covid-19 vaccine doses to the country.
""Mr. Ambassador, I’d like to just say that towards the -- maybe at the end of the year, when everything has settled down -- I intend to make a short visit to China to just shake hands with President Xi Jinping and to personally thank him for this donation. Thank you,"" he said in a speech during the arrival ceremony of the Sinovac-made vaccines at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.
Duterte later told reporters that he wanted to visit Xiamen, before Beijing, to see the school building that was built in honor of his late mother.
""Maybe I’ll go to Xiamen. There’s a school built to honor my mother. You know, my mother was one of the first educators of the Chinese school in Davao,"" he said.
He described China’s vaccine donation as a “gesture of friendship and solidarity”, which to him is the hallmark of the Philippine-China partnership.
He also noted that the Philippines is the only country to have the privilege of having the Covid-19 vaccine doses delivered instead of having to pick up the supply from China.
Should his planned trip pushes through, it will be the sixth trip of Duterte to China since he was elected president in 2016.
Duterte’s last trip to China was in August 2019. It was where he invoked the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) ruling rejecting China’s claim on the West Philippine Sea. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – Some 305 medical front-liners of the Philippine National Police (PNP) have received their CoronaVac vaccine shots in the first two days of the vaccination rollout.
PNP deputy chief for administration, Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar, said Wednesday 125 PNP personnel took the jab on Monday and 180 on Tuesday.
Only three persons developed adverse effects, such as mild skin rashes, from the immunization – two were reported on March 1 and one on March 2, Eleazar said.
He also said about 80 police personnel reported ""No Go"" on Tuesday, mostly for clinical reasons, but could still go back for rescreening.
Earlier, PNP Chief, Gen. Debold Sinas, said 800 vaccine doses were initially allotted for the police force's health workers, particularly those working as front-liners at the PNP General Hospital.
About 200 PNP health workers will be vaccinated each day.
Latest data show that recoveries among PNP personnel who contracted the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) comprise 95.7 percent of 11,420 cases in the police force.
As of Tuesday night, there were 463 active cases while 29 have recovered, pushing the tally of recoveries to 10,926.
The death toll remains at 31.
The PNP logged 48 new cases, while 17 patients and 446 patients are recuperating in hospitals and quarantine facilities, respectively, Eleazar noted.
Meanwhile, 30 front-line health workers of the Philippine Air Force (PAF) were vaccinated on Tuesday.
The PAF, with Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and Air Force commander Lt. Gen. Allen Paredes, launched the vaccination drive at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.

DUMAGUETE CITY – Negros Oriental Gov. Roel Degamo and Assistant Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Liland Estacion, will be among the first to receive the vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), regardless which brand will arrive first.
Estacion, incident commander for Covid-19 and health committee chair of the province’s Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID), said the governor asked Capitol officials and other agency heads to lead by example by receiving the vaccines first.
“In our meeting yesterday, the governor appealed to the provincial heads of offices and PIATF members that if possible, we will be the one to lead in the initial vaccination or the ceremonial vaccination of any kind of brand of vaccine that will arrive in Negros Oriental,” Estacion said in mixed English and Cebuano dialect during Tuesday’s virtual press briefing.
She, however, said it was not yet clear when the province will begin receiving the vaccines.
Health and other officials earlier admitted that some residents have apprehensions on the Covid-19 vaccination as they ramp up information and dissemination campaigns to convince the public on the safety of these vaccines.
Estacion said the brand of vaccine is immaterial provided these get an Emergency Use Authority (EUA) from concerned health agencies.
What is more important is for the priority sectors like medical health workers and front-liners to receive the vaccine at the earliest time possible, she said.
“We should be administered with the vaccine that is available, as the brands given the EUA by the Bureau of Food and Drugs, the Food and Drug Administration, and the World Health Organization, are undoubtedly safe,” she added.
“Otherwise, these brands wouldn’t have been given the EUA if they weren’t considered safe,” she said, in response to a question on whether the provincial government will wait for a more efficacious vaccine in the wake of the emergence of new variants of Covid-19.
Her statement came as the country began to roll out its massive inoculation campaign in select priority areas following the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines on Feb. 28.
Meanwhile, Covid-19 cases in the province appear to be on a downtrend, even though Estacion stressed the need for the people to not let their guards down as quarantine restrictions are already being eased.
Estacion said they received 337 swab test results on Monday, broken down into 321 negatives (with 19 recoveries), 12 new positive and four repeat-swab positive cases.
The new positive infections are from Bacong, Sibulan, Dumaguete City and Guihulngan City (two each); Basay, Dauin, Sta. Catalina, and Bayawan City (one each).
The new recoveries are from Dumaguete City and Bayawan City (seven each); Basay (two); Jimalalud, Pamplona, and Guihulngan (one each).

ILOILO CITY – The Department of Health Western Visayas Center for Health Development (DOH-WV-CHD) will try to reach at least 95 percent coverage in its measles-rubella and oral polio vaccine supplemental immunization activity (MR-OPV SIA).
The agency’s deadline has been extended to March 7 (from February 28) as over 200,000 children in the region are yet to be vaccinated.

 During the Laging Handa public briefing Tuesday, Dizon said the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and local government units (LGUs) are discussing converting quarantine facilities to vaccination centers as the government started the inoculation program against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

MANILA – The rollout of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine program is expected to increase chances of further reopening the domestic economy and support bank lending amidst its continued slowdown as of last January due to the pandemic.
 Data released by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on Tuesday showed a deeper year-on-year contraction in bank lending, excluding those placed by banks in the central bank’s overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility, of -2.4 percent from month-ago’s -0.7 percent. 
 In a report, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said the latest bank lending figure for universal and commercial banks (U/KBs) is the weakest in more than 14 years, or since August 2006. 
 Ricafort said this development is “consistent with slower business/economic conditions, in view of the GDP (gross domestic product) contraction of -9.5 percent in 2020 and -8.5 percent in fourth-quarter 2020 largely brought about by the Covid-19 lockdowns/pandemic.” 
 “The latest -2.4 percent contraction in bank loans data (is) also consistent with expectations/estimates of low single-digit year-on-year contraction in 1Q (first quarter) 2021 GDP (partly due to higher base/denominator a year ago, shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic/lockdowns),” he said.
 Ricafort said bank lending growth “has always been much faster, by about 7-10 percentage points, vis-a-vis GDP growth) for many years/decades.” 
 In the coming months, he said further easing of quarantine restrictions is seen to boost bank lending since this will result in more active economic activities thus, a pick-up in loan demand.
 “Any pick up in imports, manufacturing, and other business/economic activities would also lead to some pick up in loan demand,” Ricafort said. 
 The low interest rate environment, which is a result of the 200 basis points reduction in BSP’s key policy rates last year, is also projected to entice borrowers to take out loans, he said. 
 He added additional infrastructure spending by the government is also forecast to help lift bank lending since this has higher multiplier effects on the economy. (PNA)

On Thursday, some officials and healthcare workers of VSMMC will get the first shots of the CoronaVac developed by Sinovac Biotech in China. (Screengrab from OPAV video)
CEBU CITY – The arrival of 7,200 doses of CoronaVac here on Tuesday has given Cebuanos hope that the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic will end soon, a health official said.
The first shipment of Covid-19 vaccines made by Sinovac Biotech in China arrived at the Mactan-Cebu International Airport at 7:40 a.m. on board the Philippine Airlines Flight PR 1854 from Manila.
Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, DOH-7 chief pathologist and Covid-19 spokesperson, said the arrival of the vaccines will help expedite the reopening of the economy.
“The arrival of the vaccines has really given us a glimmer hope in our fight against Covid-19,” she said.
Loreche said they are expecting another batch of around 7,800 doses of vaccines on March 8. She did not mention whether the next batch would be the same brand from China.
The doses of CoronaVac for Cebu were part of the 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines that arrived on Feb. 28.
The national government included Cebu in the list of priority areas for its Covid-19 vaccination program.
The vaccines are now kept at the cold storage facility of the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC).
“The arrival to unloading and endorsement of the vaccines to VSMMC was smooth and effortless,” Loreche said.
First shot volunteers
Meanwhile, Loreche said she will join four officials who volunteered to lead the ceremonial vaccination using the CoronaVac along with the 768 healthcare workers (HCWs) at the VSMMC on March 4.
Apart from Loreche, DOH-7 regional director Dr. Jaime Bernadas, VSMMC hospital director Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr. and DOH-7 Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit chief Dr. Junjie Zuasula also volunteered to join the inoculation.
Retired Maj. Gen. Melquiades Feliciano, Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) deputy chief implementer, also volunteered to take the first shot of the vaccine.
Loreche said they decided to lead other front-liners in the ceremonial inoculation on Thursday to encourage other healthcare workers (HCWs) at the VSMMC to take the first shots of CoronaVac.
Last month, at least 2,900 HCWs from VSMMC gave their consent to be inoculated with CoronaVac but the number went down to 768 as some of them wanted to be inoculated with other vaccine brands.
Aquino said he is optimistic that more HCWs of the DOH-run regional hospital will get the first shot of the vaccine.
A message from Aquino’s office sent to the Philippine News Agency (PNA) said preparations for the March 4 ceremonial inoculation are ongoing.
Renewed business confidence
Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Steven Yu said the vaccine arrival has given renewed confidence to the business community in Cebu.
“The arrival of the vaccines has very significant impact to the Cebu business community. It is not just a sigh of relief but a light in the darkness,” Yu told the PNA in an interview also on Tuesday.
Yu is optimistic that the start of the vaccine rollout “signals the beginning of the end of the pandemic.”
“We are very grateful to President Duterte and his administration for going the extra, extra mile to get the vaccine despite very limited supply. This renewed hope and confidence will inspire the business community to hold on, and work harder to help in the economic recovery of our country,” he said.
Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Felix Taguiam echoed Yu’s optimistic view, saying the vaccine arrival brings relief to businessmen.
“Vaccines are starting to arrive. I'm sure more will come in the following days. Any brand is better than no vaccine. Let's get everyone to understand that being vaccinated is the only way we can all move forward,” he said. (PNA)

He said it is not only Region 7 that has experienced a low percentage of accomplishment in the MR-OPV SIA but other parts of the country as well.
Assistant Provincial Health Officer Dr. Liland Estacion, in a virtual press briefing Monday afternoon, said as of the latest data, the province has already achieved 63 percent immunization for measles and rubella and 64 percent for the oral polio vaccine.
Estacion is hopeful that the province’s accomplishment rate will rise as its health workers are scheduled to return to the areas that were not visited due to the recent storm ""Auring"", that brought with it heavy rains.
Next week, they will conduct another monitoring to determine the actual accomplishment of the government’s MR-OPV campaign in Negros Oriental, she said.
Villamor is hoping that after the one-week extension, the province would be able to attain its 95-percent accomplishment target.
The province had set a target of 142,855 children below five years old for the MR-OPV immunization activities scheduled for the entire month of February. (PNA)

DAVAO CITY – At least 12,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines arrived at the Davao International Airport on Tuesday (March 2, 2021) morning.

Dr. Annabelle Yumang, Department of Health-Davao Region (DOH-11) director, said Sinovac's CoronaVac doses would be allocated to the region's health workers, particularly those working in Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC), Mindanao's largest government-run hospital.

“The eligible population of our health care workers to get vaccinated is around 8,000, so we have a spare of 4,000 doses which will be used on their second dose. We will request another 4,000 vaccines for it to be completed,” Yumang said.

She said the first doses will be administered to the health workers on March 5 and the next dose will be after 28 days.

Upon arrival at the airport, the vaccines were brought to the DOH-11's cold storage facility for safekeeping.

“It is safe there, and we have an appropriate room to make sure that it is secured,” Yumang said.

Meanwhile, SPMC officer-in-charge, Dr. Ricardo Audan, said most of their health workers have committed to getting vaccinated.

“Based on our survey yesterday (March 1), 72 to 75 percent of the health workers here agreed to get vaccinated,” Audan said, adding that 150 health workers would be inoculated per day.

He expressed confidence in the hospital's vaccination protocols, noting that they have already conducted two vaccine simulations.

“If you can recall, the Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) team was impressed with our readiness,” he said.

Audan said a final simulation will be held on Wednesday.

Role model

Audan volunteered to be the first to get vaccinated to show other health workers that the vaccine is safe and effective.

“I have to be a role model, and I have to show to the people that the vaccine is safe or any vaccine intended for public use is safe. That is the best way to convince them,” he said.

Yumang, on the other hand, said she would also get her first dose on March 5, and urged her fellow health workers to get vaccinated ""since they are the front-liners and directly exposed to the coronavirus disease.""

By Azer Parrocha March 2, 2021, 6:42 pm
Share",Azer Parrocha,"March 2, 2021, 6:42 pm","MANILA – Malacañang on Tuesday assured that the country’s healthcare system can handle a surge in coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases including those of the South African variant.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made this statement after health authorities reported six cases of the South African Covid-19 variant in the country.
“Hindi po natin madi-deny na talagang habang nandiyan ang Covid, talagang mas maraming mahahawa. Ang importante, nasa posisyon tayo na bigyan ng medical attention at tulong iyong mga nangangailangan (We cannot deny that while Covid is there, there will be infections. What’s important is that we are in the position to give medical attention to those who need it),” he said in a Palace press briefing.
He encouraged the public to continue observing health and safety protocols such as wearing of face masks and face shields, frequent handwashing, physical distancing on top of getting vaccinated.
“Ngayong nandiyan na ang bakuna, bakit naman tayo hihindi lalo na ang mayroon nang mga bagong variants at lalo na kung ikaw po ay isang medical front-liner (Now that we have the vaccine, why say no especially now that there are new variants and especially if you’re a medical front-liner),” he added.
Asked if a stricter community quarantine status may be declared due to the new Covid-19 variant, Roque said it would still depend on the country’s healthcare utilization rate.
“Alam ninyo naman ang ating quarantine classification ang kinukonsidera iyong two-week attack rate, iyong average daily attack rate at pinakaimportante iyong healthcare utilization rate (You know that our quarantine classification takes into consideration the two-week attack rate, the average daily attack rate and the healthcare utilization rate),” he said.
Enhanced vaccination rollout
Dr. Rontgene Solante, head of San Lazaro Hospital’s Adult Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine Department, emphasized the need to observe protocols “really religiously”.
“I think we still have to continue the minimum health protocol and we have to implement it really religiously now that we have the more highly transmissible South African variant,” he said.
Solante also stressed the importance of contact tracing for those who have been exposed to the new Covid-19 variant.
“I think the point here is that the amount of work that we will be doing for the contact tracing will be very crucial, especially for those who have been exposed to this South African variant,” he added.
Since there are currently only a few cases of the South African variant, he said the government should also “enhance” the vaccine rollout.
“For now, it is not yet a concern here in the Philippines because itong mga pumapasok na variants kaunti pa lang (these new variants are still few) and that’s the reason why we really have to enhance the rollout, so that time will come na hindi tayo maabutan din ng maraming variant ng ganitong klase na (we won’t experience many variants that) will also lessen the efficacy of this vaccine,” he added.
Earlier, Health Undersecretary Dr. Maria Rosario Vergeire allayed fears that Covid-19 vaccines would offer less protection against the South African variant, saying that while variants might lower the efficacy rate, it still provides protection against severe illness.
The UK variant was first detected in the country on January 13, 2021 with confirmed local transmission in the Cordillera Administrative Region. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – National Task Force Against Covid-19 chief implementer, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. on Tuesday said the vaccination of local chief executives against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) will start once the country acquires more supply of vaccines.
“I hope they understand. Please be patient because yesterday, we had a heated discussion in Malacañang about that and our President has decided to prioritize our healthcare workers first and tell the mayors maybe when we have more vaccines they can start to be vaccinated),” Galvez said in Filipino during the rollout of the vaccination of medical front-liners at the Marikina Sports Complex.
This came after Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro, who was also present at the event, said he wanted to be among the first to be inoculated with Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccine but was not allowed to do so by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).
“Right now, our healthcare workers come first. We plan to finish first the inoculation of 1.7 million health workers nationwide,” Galvez told Teodoro.
Galvez explained that once they start vaccinating mayors, all other mayors will have themselves vaccinated too which may compromise the slots for healthcare workers.
While he understands the situation, Teodoro said he only wants to get inoculated to allay the fears of his constituents on the safety of the vaccines.
“I am 50 years old so by age, I am qualified. Yesterday, based on profiling and medical eligibility, I am qualified to get inoculated and I was also asked about my preferred vaccine. I said I can get inoculated with whatever vaccine is available because it is approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and can already be used,” Teodoro said.
Teodoro said convincing the people to get vaccinated remains a challenge as Filipinos are known to be brand conscious even in choosing medicines and vaccines.
“The refusal of a healthcare worker to get a vaccine based on brand does not mean that they will be disqualified from getting other available vaccines that will be rolled out,” he noted.
He underscored the importance of the vaccine in the fight against Covid-19 and to achieve the goal of returning to normalcy as soon as possible.
Four doctors of the ARMMC -- Dr. Emerson U. Chua, Dr. Flordeliza F. Grana, Dr. Alih Bryan T. Catis, and Dr. Rocky R. Dizon -- were among those who were inoculated during the ceremonial rollout of the Covid-19 jabs in the city. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Mayor Evelio Leonardia said on Tuesday the city government will soon finalize the details on vaccine storage and handling in preparation for the roll-out of the local Covid-19 vaccination program.
“We are now assembling a cold room with air conditioning (temperature) of 16 degrees, where the small refrigerators will be stored. Our allocated space can store as much as two million doses which is more than what we would need,” he added.
Leonardia said the plan is to procure 25 units of small refrigerators which can store some 1.6 million doses.
“It will be set up in the Government Center Annex Building. It is very strategically located. It can serve the whole city,” the mayor said.
Last week, the city government made an initial payment of more than PHP31 million to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines Inc. for the procurement of 650,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccine intended for 325,000 persons.
The advance payment would ensure the delivery of the vaccines starting the third quarter of the year.
Leonardia, the national president of the League of Cities of the Philippines, also welcomed the official roll-out of the Covid-19 vaccination in the country, with front-line medical workers and top government officials in Metro Manila receiving the first shots on Monday.
“The journey to a thousand miles begins with a first step. At least, we have already started. We should continue with our vaccination campaign. Our people must accept and cooperate,” he said.
Leonardia stressed that there is no solution in sight against Covid-19 except the vaccines.
“In the past (year), things were so dark there were no vaccines then. When the vaccines came, I was one of those who said ‘we now have seen the light at the end of the tunnel’,” he added.
The mayor urged the people of Bacolod to put their trust on the authorities such as the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health, and World Health Organization in matters related to Covid-19 vaccines.
“If we cannot trust these institutions, then where do we go? If we will not take the vaccine as our solution, what do we do? If we will not vaccinate our people, we will not know where can we get out of this pandemic,” he added.
In Bacolod, the Emergency Operations Center and the City Health Office have identified 40 vaccination centers that will accommodate residents who will be inoculated against Covid-19.
The city’s goal is to vaccinate 424,992 individuals, or 68 percent of its total population, as the remaining 32 percent consists of 18 years old and below, who cannot be vaccinated.
Each vaccination center could have a daily maximum target of 500 vaccines to be administered, for an estimated 20,000 individuals, if the program goes full speed. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – An official of the Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday said more individuals are expected to receive the CoronaVac vaccine in the coming days as both the number of institutions administering the vaccine and public confidence increased after the successful first day of the country’s immunization program.
In a Laging Handa briefing on Tuesday, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire lauded the leadership of the hospitals that administered the vaccine for taking the lead and boosting the morale of their personnel on inoculation.
“Katulad nila Dr. [Gerardo] ‘Gap’ Legaspi, yung ating eksperto na si Dr. Edsel Salvana, Si Dr. [Alfonso] Famaran po ng Tala Hospital [Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital]. Sa tingin ko po ay nakapag-bigay din ng kumpyansa sa ating mga healthcare workers (Those such as Dr. Gap Legaspi, our expert Dr. Edsel Salvana, Dr. Famaran of Tala Hospital. In my opinion, they gave confidence to our healthcare workers),” Vergeire said.
In a virtual Palace press briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the first day of the government’s national Covid-19 vaccination program was very successful.
“Naging napakatagumpay po ng day one ng ating national Covid-19 vaccination program kung saan lahat po ay nagdiwang. May iba pa nga pong naiyak sa tuwa lalo na po sa PGH nung nakita nilang nagpapabakuna si Dr. Gap Legaspi (Day one of the national Covid-19 vaccination program was very successful. Everyone celebrated. Some got teary-eyed especially in PGH when they saw that Dr. Gap Legaspi got vaccinated),” he said.
DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III, in a news release on Tuesday, thanked the hospital directors of the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), Tala Hospital, the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP), the Veteran’s Memorial Medical Center (VMMC), Victoria Luna Medical Center (VLMC), and the Philippine National Police (PNP) General Hospital “for taking the lead in this inoculation.”
“We are also thankful to the doctors, medical specialists, and health workers who served as credible exemplars to ordinary Filipinos in trusting the science of vaccines,” Duque said.
According to the National Vaccine Operations Center, at least 128 individuals were vaccinated at the PGH, 85 from Tala Hospital, 20 from the LCP, 110 from the PNP General Hospital, 353 from the VMMC, and 60 from the VLMC—totaling to 756 vaccinated individuals during the country’s first day of the vaccine rollout.
“Now that we have commenced our rollout, the challenge now is increasing uptake and restoring public’s confidence in vaccines. We encourage eligible individuals to seize the very first opportunity they will be presented with to get vaccinated against Covid-19,” Duque said.
He said aside from international experts, local health specialists have already studied the safety of the vaccine manufactured by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech and asked the public to “trust the scientific process.”
“Every front-liner, every Filipino that will be vaccinated, and every dose that will be administered takes us a step closer towards a safer recovery,” Duque said.
Covid-19 chief implementer and Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government aims to complete the inoculation of all healthcare workers in March “to ensure the preservation of the country’s healthcare system.”
During the first quarter of this year, he said the Philippines is set to receive a total of 5.1 million vaccine doses.
He encouraged healthcare workers to have themselves immunized with whatever vaccine is available as these are “guaranteed to be safe and effective.”
“Ang lahat ng mga bakunang inaangkat natin, ‘yung 161 million doses ay safe at effective. Ang best vaccine ay ‘yung effective at efficient na dumating ng mas maaga (All vaccines we’re importing, the 161 million doses, are safe and effective.

 On the other hand, Financials slipped by 1.41 percent, Mining and Oil, 0.54 percent; and Services, 0.29 percent.
 Volume totaled 126.72 billion shares amounting to PHP9.89 billion. 
 Losers led gainers at 121 to 105, while 44 shares were unchanged. 
 “The local index climbed in a broad-based rally as stocks tied to the economic reopening jumped on vaccine optimism, while tech names rebounded from steep losses the previous month,” Luis Limlingan, Regina Capital Development Corporation head of sales, said. 
 He also cited as a plus to investors’ optimism the positive developments on the Biden administration’s proposed USD1.9-trillion coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) stimulus program, which was approved by the House of Representatives over the weekend and awaiting Senate’s approval. 
 These factors are, however, countered by rising oil prices in the international market “as fears that Chinese oil crude consumption is slowing,” he said. 
 Limlingan said the price of Brent crude oil slipped by 81 cents to around USD63.61 per barrel and the price of US West Texas Intermediate fell by 97 cents to about USD60.53 a barrel.
 Meanwhile, the peso closed the day’s trading little changed against the US dollar at 48.565 from the previous day’s 48.59. 
 It opened the day at 48.58 and traded between 48.61 and 48.5. 
 Average level for the day stood at 48.571.
 Volume totaled to USD856.94 million, higher than the USD678.45 million a day ago.
 In a reply to e-mailed questions from PNA, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said the local currency closed the day’s trade to its weakest in four months but its strongest in more than a week “amid continued optimism on the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccine shots that started yesterday (March 1, 2021).”
 Ricafort said the start of the vaccination program “would help reduce new Covid-19 cases that would also help justify further reopening of the economy and help improve economic recovery prospects and valuations.”
 “The latest measures to reopen the economy such as on MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions), cinemas, museums, among others, also support the recent gains in the peso and in the local stock market, consistent with expectations on a possible MGCQ (modified general community quarantine) nationwide by April-May 2021,” he said.

MANILA – Despite his willingness to get the Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccine shot, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Tuesday explained why only four ranking government officials were allowed to get the jab along with frontline medical workers.
In a Palace press briefing, Roque said President Rodrigo Duterte specifically directed Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. and Testing Czar Vince Dizon to subject themselves to inoculation since they are among the faces of the government’s national Covid-19 vaccination program.
“Ayaw pa po sana pero talagang si Presidente po nagsabi, at least ang dalawang ito kinakailangan mabakunahan dahil (They didn’t want to go first but the President really said that at least these two need to get vaccinated because) of course we need to walk the talk,” Roque said.
At the start of the vaccination program on Monday, Galvez got inoculated at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) in Manila while Dizon received a vaccine shot at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium in Caloocan City.
Besides Galvez and Dizon, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Dr. Eric Domingo and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chief Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr. also got administered with CoronaVac.
Domingo and Abalos were also vaccinated at the UP-PGH along with frontline medical workers.
“Dahil si Director Domingo siya’y nag-approve again yung epekto po ng pagbabakuna niya inaasahan natin magbu-boost po ‘yan ng kumpiyansa dahil hindi naman siya mag-a-approve ng hindi niya gagamitin sa kanyang pagkatao. At siyempre si Mayor Abalos, that’s representative po for all our mayors na handa na rin magpabakuna (Director Domingo approved the vaccine so the effect of his getting vaccinated is expected to boost confidence because he won’t approve a vaccine he won’t use. And of course, Mayor Abalos, that’s representative for all our mayors who are ready to get vaccinated),” he said.
Roque said while he also wanted to get vaccinated, the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG) discouraged him from doing so.
Medical front-liners first
Roque explained that the iNITAG, which drafted the Covid-19 vaccination priority list, discouraged him and some 50 “influencers” from getting the Sinovac vaccine before healthcare workers.
He did not name the influencers but noted that they were mostly ranking government officials including himself, lawmakers, media personalities, and movie personalities.
Roque said he and other members of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) proposed a list of 50 influencers to get vaccinated to boost public confidence in vaccines. However, the iNITAG rejected their proposal.
“Gusto ko talaga magpabakuna, kaya lang po meron tayong tinatawag na iNITAG at tatapatin ko po kayo kami po sa IATF ay nag-propose ng mga singkuwenta na mga bakuna ireserba para sa tinatawag nating influencers nang mapainting natin ang ating vaccine confidence. Hindi po sumang-ayon ang iNITAG. Ako po’y sumusunod naman (I really wanted to get vaccinated, but we have what we call the iNITAG and I will be honest, us at the IATF, we proposed to reserve 50 vaccine doses for influencers to boost vaccine confidence but the iNITAG did not agree),” he said.
He said while some vaccinators at the UP-PGH, where the vaccination drive officially commenced, offered to reserve a dose for him, he eventually opted to stick to the priority list.
“Bagamat kahapon nagmabuting loob ang PGH ‘kung gusto mo, bibigay na namin sayo.’ At naghanda na po ako. Kaya lang news came to me na talagang matindi yung pagtutol ng iNITAG na magpaturok ang hindi mga medical front-liners so to avoid controversy hindi na po ako nagtuloy (The PGH offered to give me a shot. I prepared for it. But news came to me that the iNITAG was against allowing non-medical front-liners to get vaccinated so to avoid controversy, I didn’t get inoculated,” he added.
Roque also noted that the UP-PGH actually ran out of vaccine doses since only around 60-70 individuals had confirmed to subject themselves to vaccination, but 128 people showed up.
“Ang totoo naman po naubusan sila kahapon kasi akala nga nila 60 lang, 128 ang nagpabakuna (The truth is they ran out of vaccine doses yesterday because they prepared for 60 people but 128 got vaccinated),” he said.
Roque said that a total of 3.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses will be alloted for 1.7 million healthcare workers in the country.
He, however, assured that he would get vaccinated as soon as he would be given the go signal from iNITAG.
On Sunday, the Philippines received the initial 600,000 doses of Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines donated by China in a simple turnover ceremony led by President Rodrigo Duterte.

MANILA – The rollout of the government's coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccination program brings hope that the pandemic will end soon, a medical front-liner in Pasig City said on Tuesday.
""Narito na po ang bakuna. Narito na po yung pag-asa natin. Ito ang bakuna na malaking tulong sa paglaban sa pandemyang ito. May kalayaan tayong pumili pero ang mahalaga ay may bakuna na (The vaccine is here. Our hope is here. This is the vaccine that will greatly help us in fighting the pandemic. We are free to choose [which vaccine we want] but what is important is we now have a vaccine,"" Dr. Nerissa Sabarre, head of the Pasig City Covid-19 Referral Center, told reporters shortly after her vaccination at the Pasig City General Hospital Outpatient Department.
Sabarre said being injected with the Chinese-made CoronaVac was her personal choice.
""Walang pong pilitang nangyari dito (No prodding or pressure of any kind took place to make me consider the vaccine),"" she added.
Sabarre said the Covid-19 vaccine would be a big help in the ongoing fight against the pandemic.
Four other medical professionals were inoculated with the Chinese-made vaccines –Bernadette Bajit, Ian Anthony M. Castro, Karla Kristel Banares, and Brenda Lizaro.
The Pasig City General Hospital was earlier allocated with 300 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac for the inoculation of an initial 150 medical personnel.
Meanwhile, Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto, who was present in the event along with National Task Force (NTF) Deputy Chief Implementer Secretary Vince Dizon, said he is willing to have himself vaccinated once he is allowed to do so. 
""Kapag panahon ko na po sa 'prioritization guidelines' natin at sabihin ng DOH (Department of Health) na pwede na ko, anytime okay naman ako (When it is my time to be included in the prioritization guidelines and I am told by the DOH that I could get vaccinated, I am okay with that anytime),"" Sotto said when asked if he was willing to have himself vaccinated to help reduce the Filipinos' hesitancy in getting inoculated.
He said the confidence level on the Sinovac vaccine ""has no way to go but up"" with the vaccination of Sabarre and other health professionals.
Meanwhile, he said the city continues to gear up for the arrival of more Covid-19 vaccines.
""We are talking about the global supply chain here. There are many factors that are beyond our control. Still, we are making the necessary preparations so that once these vaccines arrive anytime, we are ready,"" Sotto said. 
In a social media post, Sotto reported that 167 hospital-based healthcare professionals in the city have volunteered to get vaccinated.
""Thank you to the national government for the initial 600 doses. Sec. Vince Dizon represented the national government in this morning's Ceremonial Vaccination. Dr. Neri, head of our Covid Referral Center, is the FIRST PASIGUEÑO to be vaccinated,"" he said.
While stressing that ""best vaccine is the vaccine that is available"", Sotto said he understands those who are hesitant to get inoculated.
""Vaccination is on a purely voluntary basis and healthcare staff who decline one brand will still be the first priority for the next brand that arrives,"" he added.
The Pasig City government has earlier ordered 400,000 doses of Covid-19 jabs from AstraZeneca worth PHP100 million through a tripartite deal with the pharmaceutical firm and the national government. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Share",Filane Mikee Cervantes,"March 2, 2021, 5:05 pm","ACT-CIS Rep. Eric Yap 
MANILA – The chairman of the House of Representatives’ Committee on Appropriations said Tuesday he would file a PHP50-billion supplemental budget to augment the Pension and Gratuity Fund (PGF) for retired uniformed personnel in the 2021 national budget.
ACT-CIS Rep. Eric Yap made the statement after Anakalusugan Party-list Rep. Mike Defensor, a known ally of former Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, blamed Speaker Lord Allan Velasco for the decrease in the budget of the 2021 PGF by PHP20 billion during a privilege speech on Monday.
Yap noted that there were no irregularities in passing the 2021 General Appropriations Act, saying it was deliberated upon by both the House and the Senate, with consultation with the Executive Branch, particularly the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).
He further explained that the PHP20 billion was a buffer fund, which the DBM and the legislature all agreed to realign in favor of budget items meant to address the coronavirus pandemic, including the procurement of vaccines and personal protective equipment of medical front-liners.
Yap said the supplemental budget proposal would help absorb the fund deficiency brought about by the PHP70-billion budget cut made by the previous House leadership in the 2020 budget.
“The PGF was slashed by the previous House leadership by PHP70-billion,” he said during his interpellation on Monday. “I was puzzled then as to why that was, considering that there was no pandemic yet at that time.”
Deputy Speaker Isidro Ungab also manifested that the 2020 national budget had several realignments, confirming that the PGF was then slashed by PHP74.029-billion by Cayetano and former Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte.
Ungab chaired the House Committee on Appropriations during Cayetano’s term as Speaker.
Meanwhile, Defensor disputed Yap’s claim that the PHP20 billion in military and police retirees’ pension money was diverted to Covid-19 vaccine procurement.
“To set the record straight, the vaccine procurement fund approved by Congress, as recommended by the bicameral conference committee (bicam) and carried in the 2021 budget, was PHP2.5 billion, which is good for just a few thousand doses and which was the amount recommended by the executive branch at the beginning of the pandemic,” he said.
Defensor noted that PHP2.5 billion is the amount that is “sure of funding,” as it is part of the “programmed” portion of the 2021 national budget.
He said Congress allocated an additional PHP172 billion but lodged it in the “unprogrammed” part of the outlay, which means it is available only if there is excess revenue, there is a new tax measure as funding source, or there are loans.
“Through the bicam, Congress juggled at least PHP182 billion in appropriations recommended by President Duterte in his version of the budget. None of that, not even a centavo or peso, was added by the two chambers to the Palace-recommended PHP2.5-billion vaccine procurement fund,” he said. (PNA)

MANILA – The Quezon City government is ready for its Covid-19 vaccination rollout on Wednesday after receiving the CoronaVac jabs donated by China.
“'Yung aming nag-iisang local government-run Covid-19 referral hospital, the Quezon City General Hospital, we already received our allocation kahapon din (For our only local government-run Covid-19 referral hospital, the Quezon City General Hospital, we already received our allocation yesterday),” Belmonte said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency on Tuesday.
Medical front-liners will be the first to receive the Sinovac shots based on the directives of the national government and the National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19.
QC Task Force on Covid-19 chief Joseph Juico said they are targeting to inoculate about 100 medical front-liners on the first day.
“A total of 300 doses were delivered to us for the first shots. The next 300 doses will be arriving in time for the second shots. That is, before the 28th day from the first jab,” he said.
Belmonte is confident more of the city’s medical front-liners will agree to receive the vaccines, which arrived in the country on Sunday and immediately dispatched to local government units the following day.
Initially, just like a few other hospitals in Metro Manila, their medical front-liners were hesitant in receiving vaccines, according to Belmonte.
She said this may be due to misinformation, fake news, and demonization about the quality of the China-made vaccines.
“Now after we made an effort to conduct town hall meetings wherein all of their concerns were properly addressed and in fact it was shown that when you’re talking about efficacy, it would protect you 100 percent from death, 100 percent from the severity and even from hospitalization, then they were convinced about the Sinovac vaccines,” Belmonte said.
The news of St. Luke’s Medical Center Hospital's request for 5,000 doses of Sinovac from the national government, as reported by NTF chief Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. to President Rodrigo Duterte, might influence other medical front-liners to get vaccinated, Belmonte said.
“If there’s vaccine confidence among St. Luke’s doctors, who for me are one of the best doctors at least in our city, there’s confidence in Sinovac, then that’s very good news. Hopefully, that would influence other health workers to embrace the vaccine as well,” Belmonte said.
If permitted, Belmonte is willing to receive her first shot of the Sinovac vaccine.
“No hesitations. None at all,” she said. (PNA)

MANILA – The country's military chief on Tuesday urged troops to show their ""strong resolve of support"" to the government's ongoing vaccination program against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disease.
“As the Chief-of-Staff of the AFP, and in full confidence of our government’s pursuit of promoting the interests of our people; I urge our troops to wholeheartedly support our government’s vaccination program. Let us collectively show our strong resolve of support and trust to this very decisive initiative,” said Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief, Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, during the symbolic vaccination of Sinovac Biotech CoronaVac vaccines to medical frontliners assigned at the AFP headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City Tuesday.
Aside from Sobejana, also present in the event held at the Tejeros Hall, Commissioned Officers Club, was Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Health Undersecretary Myrna C. Cabotaje along with other senior defense officials.
“We in the AFP significantly figure in today’s symbolic vaccination program. We stand alongside our colleagues from the national agencies and local government units in a show of might and resolve in support of the National Vaccine Deployment Program,” he added.
Meanwhile, Col. Maria Sheila Jardiolin, a doctor and the commanding officer of Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo Station Hospital, headed the health services personnel in the facility’s vaccination rollout.
The priority of the vaccination remains to be the medical health workers who perform anti-Covid-19 operations.
Dubbed as “BIDA BAKUNATION” the program seeks to bring immense benefits that the people need in order to restore normalcy in the country. It puts across the important message of protecting and preserving Filipino lives amid the pandemic.
The vaccination program also reassures the effectiveness of the vaccine, which is fully backed by expert and professional advice from esteemed health practitioners of the country.
Sobejana also extended the AFP's gratitude to the national government and the persevering team that tirelessly worked hard to bring these much-needed vaccines.
He said the rollout is the start of many more positive actions from the administration to deliver to the Filipino people.
“With the ongoing vaccine distribution and the attendant inoculation of our front-liners, the days ahead certainly look positive. These coming days bode well for all of us for we will certainly rise above the challenge,” Sobejana said.
Meanwhile, AFP spokesperson, Marine Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo, in a message to reporters, identified three of the medical officers who were vaccinated in the ceremonial inoculation.
They are Lt. Col. Jacquelyn Cloma, MC (Medical Corps); Maj. Francis Andrade, MAC (Medical Administrative Corps (MAC) and Maj. Richard Delgado, NC (Nurse Corps).
At the Manila Naval Hospital, Arevalo said its commander, Col. Puralyn Epres, led the vaccination of medical workers of the Philippine Navy and Philippine Marines.
""At the Army General Hospital in Fort Bonifacio, Lt. Col. Teresita R Merioles, MC leads the (medical workers) of the Philippine Army,"" he added.
At the Philippine Air Force General Hospital, Maj. Irene M. Abutas, MC led the medical workers of the PAF.
""The target today is to vaccinate at least 30 MHWs in each of the hospitals in the four camps named,"" Arevalo said.
At the Philippine Army headquarters, its chief Lt. Gen. Jose C. Faustino Jr. received the first dose of CoronaVac vaccines.
Faustino, along with vice commander Maj. Gen. Robert C. Dauz, chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Rowen S. Tolentino, and Army General Hospital Executive Officer, Lt. Col. Teresita Merioles got vaccinated in the presence of Department of Health's (DOH) Disease Prevention and Control Bureau Director Dr. Aleli Amie Grace Sudincal, Department of the Interior and Local Government Assistant Secretary Marcelo Morales, and National Task Force against Covid-19 deputy chief implementer, Secretary Vince Dizon.
The vaccine will be distributed to 5,000 personnel in the next 15 days and planning for the nationwide vaccination rollout to all units in 18 Army hospitals is ongoing.
""Remember that being inoculated is our duty to the country and to the Filipino people whom we have sworn to serve and protect,"" Faustino told the troops. ""And to our countrymen, please know that the relentless trust and confidence you accord the Army drive us more to continue our efforts to effectively perform our mandate to serve the people and secure the land.""
At the Manila Naval Hospital, Col. Pura Lyn Epres spearheaded the administration of the initial vaccine dosage to 30 Navy hospital and health service front-liners headed by the first vaccinee, acting Chief Surgeon Navy, Col. Reynaldo Capuz who was inoculated by DOH regional director, Dr. Corazon Flores.
These individuals who carry out anti-Covid-19 operations were prioritized to receive the limited first batch of available vaccines but the command endeavors to inoculate all its personnel upon the availability of more dosages.
Navy chief, Vice Adm. Giovanni Carlo Bacordo said Tuesday's inoculation was “truly monumental for the Philippine Navy because it marks the beginning of the implementation of the government’s national vaccination program in the PN, which is expected to be in full swing in the coming weeks.”
“The Philippine Navy is one with the national government and the DOH in protecting and saving Filipino people’s health and lives. We also need this vaccine for us to be able to do our job and we will have them very soon…Little by little, step by step, we can and we will overcome this COVID-19 pandemic together,” Bacordo said.
Around 100,000 of the 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine donated by the Chinese Ministry of Defense were allotted to the Department of National Defense (DND).
The DND will initially inoculate almost 15,000 individuals using close to 30,000 doses while the remaining 70,000 doses will be given to the AFP. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency
