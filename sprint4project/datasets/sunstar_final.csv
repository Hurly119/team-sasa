We know how busy you are and we are really impressed that you have given us this much time.”Coa guidanceAguinaldo, in giving guidance to the city mayors, said: “I had to issue notes on the guidelines on the auditors to remind them that we are still under a pandemic situation and that they should always consider that in conducting the audit.”Leonardia told Aguinaldo that LCP would prefer that the national government will do the negotiation and procurement with the vaccine companies while the LGUs will simply reimburse the national government. Aguinaldo expressed openness to the proposition but suggested that everybody should wait for what exactly will be the final arrangements.Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso, for his part, said: “The logic is to achieve our goal which is the herd immunity concept. The earlier, the better — as long as it is certified by local agencies like the FDA (Food and Drug Administration).”The general assembly was participated in by 77 cities including 58 mayors.Among those in attendance were LCP Secretary-General and Calapan City Mayor Arnan Panaligan; LCP Committee on Vaccine Availment chair Iloilo City Mayor Jerry Treñas; vice chair General Santos City Mayor Ronnel Rivera; and members Public Relations Officer Ormoc City Mayor Richard Gomez, Bacoor City Mayor Lani Mercado, Balanga City Mayor Francis Anthony Garcia, Zamboanga City Mayor Beng Climaco, and Candon City Mayor Ericson Singson, Tangub City Mayor Jennifer Tan, Pagadian City Mayor Samuel Co; and LCP Focal Mayor for Environment, Climate Change, and DRRM Mayor Noel Rosal of Legazpi City, LCP executive director Veronica Hitosis, and other LCP officials.

If we talk about the efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine which is somewhere 50 percent, we should think that 50 percent is much-much better than zero percent. It’s still a big thing,” he said.A total of 6,300 doses of Sinovac vaccines intended for the medical frontliners from Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH) and Riverside Medical Center arrived in Bacolod City on Friday.These vaccines were allotted by the National Government to prioritize first the medical frontliners assigned at Level-3 Covid-19 facilities.

These are the people who know what is this all about. These are the people who can comprehend what are the consequences of the vaccine and yet, they were here to be example for all of us. For us, they are heroes,” Leonardia said.He said they are hopeful that this is going to be a giant leap for the city’s intention to reach the number of people to be vaccinated in Bacolod.The mayor noted that Dr. Sarabia and wife are the first couple ever in Western Visayas to have received the Sinova vaccine.“Hopefully, this will encourage the people to avail the Covid-19 vaccine. Most of our residents want to wait and see how a Covid-19 vaccine works in others before they would get it,” Leonardia said.He said medical doctors, who joined the ceremonial vaccination, did not feel any untoward reaction after the vaccination.He added about 60 million individuals were already vaccinated in the United States and more than 20 million persons in Europe, and that there is no reason for Bacolodnons not to avail of the Covid-19 vaccine.Leonardia said he is also willing to be vaccinated, but the Sinovac is only intended for the persons aged 18 to 59 and will have to wait for other vaccines to arrive in Bacolod.Leonardia said Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran along with Councilors Israel Salanga, Cindy Rojas and Ayesha Villaflor were already ready for vaccination, but they were not vaccinated since the first priority is the medical frontliners.He said a day before the delivery of the Sinovac vaccine, he texted vaccine czar Carlito Galvez that there are some city councilors who want to be vaccinated with Sinovac vaccine, but Galvez replied that the vaccine is limited and it will prioritize the medical frontliners.He added the Department of Health had set the guidelines and they should follow it.",sunstar

The US is the latest to approve the use of vaccine after determining the urgency of its use and determining the efficacy with no adverse effects to the recipients.The United Kingdom started ahead of using the same vaccine. Other countries like Canada and Saudi Arabia have also given the signal to use this vaccine to their people.In the local setting, we seem to look at these developments as news that would not actually reach us soon. Yet we can see how countries would decide hastily on a vaccine that supposedly will be created in years and not months. We could assume that everything had also been considered including the role of their health experts and the urgency of the situation. The leaders of these countries knew that they deal with life and they cannot add more to the growing number of deaths.For now, while we wait for our government to complete the negotiations with the manufacturers of the vaccine, we are left uncertain about our time. This means we can still expect that many of our people could be infected and deaths could come at anybody regardless of age.What we can do is to keep a reminder to ourselves that the coronavirus is still around and we have a role to end up surviving this pandemic. So while the vaccines are not yet available, to think about the health protocols is the least that we can do. But our people should not be left with hanging options about their ways to survive this pandemic. That is the reason why we have a government because it undertakes the very role of an institution for the people. Our collective response should always be proactive and not passive.The next is to ensure that the vaccine is safe and that the stigma of using this in the past would not haunt us this time. We need the government assurance that above all, we are solving a problem and not adding to it.I was surprised to hear about the passing of our friend Butch Ebreo. When I was the chairman of the Alay Lakad, I used to work with Sir Butch. He was then the representative of city government along with other members of different committees. He was very cooperative in our programs for the youth.There are also times when he would visit me at the Capitol to ask me about some of his activities. His son, Carlo, is also my childhood friend.This is another example of our continued struggle in fighting the coronavirus. Though we have the heart to keep fighting, we cannot ignore the fact that we have friends and relatives who may be victims in the future.Because the virus is an unseen enemy, we also cannot be assured that we could be spared. We are breathing on temporary relief, yet, there is still a threat that we have to face every day of our lives.*",sunstar

With his authority to allow advance payment, our local vaccination program can be set in accelerated motion,” Leonardia had said.During its prior Special General Assembly last January 12, which was attended by 114 city mayors, the LCP agreed to partner with the national government in implementing the Covid-19 vaccination program. The League took initiatives in encouraging cities to procure their vaccines to ensure that the target population is vaccinated.As a result of this initiative and in coordination with the National Task Force Against Covid-19, several cities have already entered into tripartite agreements with AstraZeneca pharmaceutical company under the “A Dose of Hope” program on January 14.About 300 companies and 39 LGUs from across the country pitched in for the purchase of AstraZeneca’s vaccines.AstraZeneca is asking for a 20-percent downpayment, said San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora, who signed a tripartite agreement with the vaccine maker and the national government.Pursuant to Presidential Decree 1445, local government units need an express authorization and issuance from President Duterte such as an Executive Order allowing them to procure vaccines and proceed with the required advance payment market provision in their respective agreements with the pharmaceutical companies.In the same press briefing, Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said that local governments could make up to 50 percent down payment on Covid-19 vaccines.

NICAVERA,"February 08, 2021","A TOP official of Transcom said the business process outsourcing (BPO) firm will provide free vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to its employees in the country including Bacolod City once these are available.Transcom Worldwide Chief Executive Officer for Global English Region Mark Lyndsell, in a statement Monday, February 8, 2021, said the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines for its employees is part of the company’s intensified fight against the virus.For Bacolod City alone, one of the largest sites of the company, Transcom has to provide free vaccines to about 2,900 employees.Emergency Operation Center (EOC) Task Force Deputy for Medical and Data Analysis Dr. Chris Sorongon earlier said the company is already in talks with the executives of Moderna, an American pharmaceutical and biotechnology, for the possible purchase of vaccines for their employees.It might be a two-way approach because the BPO company can directly transact with Moderna for vaccine procurement or avail of the AstraZeneca vaccines that the city is also providing for the residents, he said.Lyndsell said in its drive against the spread of Covid-19, Transcom vowed to strengthen its partnership with the local government.He recalled that they also pledged to donate half a million pesos to the city’s South Hill Quarantine Facility to support local residents.“The firm’s commitment is to go above and beyond the minimum set of requirements by the Department of Labor and Employment (Dole) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) with respect to workplace prevention and control of the disease,” Lyndsell added.Following the recent incident where 41 of its employees tested positive for Covid-19, Transcom Bacolod ceased its onsite operation and yet to resume probably today, February 9.Transcom now runs its Bacolod operations at 95 percent work at home.The company said it hopes to maintain a large percentage of its Philippine operations on a work at home setup even after the pandemic with guidance from its clients.Meanwhile, employees who are designated to work onsite went through another round of company-sponsored RT-PCR test on Saturday, February 6.The company said it is separating the onsite team into two groups that will be assigned in two separate buildings.These employees will be prevented from having close interactions as an additional safeguard to minimize any risk of transmission. Spacing between workstations are widened to enforce stricter social distancing guidelines.Following the recommendations of the EOC Task Force, Transcom is set to install additional safety equipment such as High-Efficiency Particulate Air filters and other air circulation devices.It will also work closely with the local government and landlord of its Bacolod facilities to ensure that surrounding businesses are also held to the same high standards to protect employees and the wider community.It said onsite protocols such as BaCTrac check-in, online daily health status declaration, and company-initiated antigen tests every seven days are strictly implemented, adding that the company also maintains readily available personal protective equipment supplies for its employees.“Heeding calls for help, the company provided care packs, which consisted of food and water supplies, for 150 employees who were put on strict lockdown by local officials,” it also said.Lyndsell said prior to the Covid-19 breakout incident, Transcom’s Bacolod site completed and passed the Dole audit which covered mandatory provisions on Covid-19 prevention, along with occupational health and safety and general labor standards on July 3, 2020 and October 21, 2020.He said its health and safety measures are strictly aligned with the Interim Guideline on Workplace Prevention and Control of Covid-19 of the Dole and DTI, which was issued on May 1, 2020, and the subsequent Joint Memorandum Circular No. 20-04-A of the same agencies issued on August 15, 2020.“Compliance with health and safety protocols is not just about protecting Transcom but also about protecting our families and the wider community. In the spirit and true meaning of ‘malasakit’ all our employees are reminded of our duty to care for ourselves and others,” the official added.",sunstar

It seems reasonable to be skeptical of such hastily produced vaccines which normally would take years to develop and produce.Major pharmaceutical companies have been transparent to a certain extent as to the different unique types and underlying pharmacological details and chemical structures. There may be some reason to be both wary and optimistic for such developments.While this pandemic has been unprecedented, what is clear is how there would be eager opportunists ready to capitalize on such a crisis. A select group of people stand to benefit much from this pandemic and we can only hope that they opt to do the right thing when it comes to critical decisions which primarily happen behind closed doors. We can but hope for morality to overrule a profiteering agenda detrimental to the common good. It is truly hard to discern what is truly taking place in actuality.A fluctuating reinforcement of public protocols and more swab test mandates have added more burden to our pockets. It has been an absolutely distressful reality which has crippled a big chunk of our lives. And it does not appear the virus is slowing down anytime soon given the many spikes that come and go.While I do not mean to cast doubt on the vaccines to get the ball rolling and get the economy revitalized, there may be some validity in expressing doubt given the prevalent news reports regarding side effects and negative implications from early trials. It is understandable to be fearful of something completely unparalleled.However, given the surge in cases of the so-called new strain which seem to spread more quickly, the government is eager to speed up the vaccine rollouts of the different major companies. Many different vaccine types have each with its own sets of pros and cons. It may be essential to make a sound and rational choice as to what solutions and options are best for our close relationships.We can only but brace ourselves in such uncertain times on what is still yet to come, but there is a need to stay resilient regardless of any outcome. But what is blatantly clear is how we cannot endure any more lockdowns and how there is a need for a better trajectory this year considering how we have become more educated on the virus. It is time to gain momentum and get back on track. There is nowhere else to go but up.",sunstar

This is, after all, a top priority for all of us,” Leonardia stressed.Aside from coordinating with concerned government agencies and key officials, the LCP Committee is also tasked to conduct “exploratory talks” with qualified pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Aztra Zeneca, and GlaxoSmithKline in the first week of January and carry out a collective and advantageous vaccine availment by the cities.Leonardia believes that while the national government is committed to providing vaccines nationwide, it is in the best interest of the cities that they are ready to supplement, augment, and complete the national vaccination program. He added that this is all a matter of teamwork to ensure our people’s health and safety.Meanwhile, the LCP, recognizing the urgency of vaccine availment, has also scheduled a dialog with Vaccine Czar Secretary Carlito Galvez on January 12 where city mayors nationwide are expected to participate.

PEDROSA,"March 08, 2021","“AS A doctor, whatever is available, take it. It’s better than zero protection. This vaccine (Sinovac) is better than no vaccine at all.”This was stressed by Dr. Julius Drilon, medical chief of Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH), on Monday, March 8, 2021, during the ceremonial vaccination program against Covid-19 held at the hospital Reodica Hall.Nine of its medical frontliners, six of them doctors, received their first dose of the Sinovac vaccine.These included Dr. Franklin Delano Tumaneng, Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS) operations chief; Dr. Joan Cerrada, HEICS planning chief; Antonio Monfort, OIC-chief administrator officer; Marybeth Marcial, chief nurse; John Micahel Gabriel Zaragosa, HEICS public information officer; Dr. Hary Carial, Department of Internal Medicine; Dr. Eirene Ayalin, chairman, Department of Family and Community Medicine; Dr. Carina Frayco, infectious disease specialist; and Dr. Rhea Tabujara, pulmonologist.A total of 6,300 doses of Sinovac vaccines intended for medical frontliners from CLMMRH and Riverside Medical Center arrived in Bacolod City on Friday. The two hospitals were identified as Level-3 Covid-19 facilities and the medical frontliners are the priority of the Covid-19 vaccine.These vaccines were allotted by the National Government to prioritize first the medical frontliners assigned at Level-3 Covid-19 facilities. It is part of the 600,000 initial doses donated by China to the Philippine government.Drilon said initially, a total of 900 frontliners at CLMMRH signified their intention to be vaccinated against Covid-19.CLMMRH has a total of 1, 743 employees, but Drilon said only half of the number signified their intention to be vaccinated because they did not know the kind of vaccine to be given to them.He said they were given Sinovac vaccine, but they did not know how many of them are 60 years old and above since Sinovac is only good for recipients aged 18 to 59 years old.“That’s the reason why we have low number of recipients for Covid-19 vaccine, but we are hopeful that it will increase,” he added.Drilon said they received a total of 1,800 doses of Sinovac vaccine and will prioritize their frontline services staff, doctors and nurses.He said the CLMMRH is capable of storing all four brands of Covid-19 vaccines available in the market through the hospital-owned cold storage facilities that are now in place.Drilon, who just turned 60, also signified to take the first dose of Sinovac vaccine.“I’ll take the risk and it’s my advice, as a doctor, whatever is available take it. It’s better than zero protection. The recipient will be given two doses of Sinovac vaccine. If you are vaccinated in any four types of the vaccines available in the world now, will not prevent you from being infected but it will just prevent you from going into moderate and severe infection. It will now lessen the admission of Covid-19 related symptoms,” Drilon said.He said they will start the vaccination for their staff Tuesday, with 150 healthcare workers a day. They are hopeful to finish the Covid-19 vaccination within four to five days.If they cannot use all the supplied Sinovac vaccine, he added that the Department of Health (DOH) has a guideline on what to do with the excess vaccine for a proper accounting.“I encourage everybody, my fellow healthcare workers, to have yourself vaccinated because it’s a responsibility to yourself, family and to your community. We have enough doses to accommodate everyone who is willing to be vaccinated,” Drilon said.For her part, Cerrada said she is happy and proud to be able to protect herself, her family and patients.Cerrada urged the public to have themselves vaccinated, which is a privilege for everyone because the vaccine is given for free, as she underscored the need for the public to develop herd immunity that can only be achieved if many of the population will be vaccinated.“We have had everything -- distancing face shield, facemask -- everything, but it’s still there. So what is one that is missing? It’s the vaccination and that’s what we need today to be able to have layers of protection against the virus,” Cerrada said.",sunstar

The resource speaker was Dr. Nina Gloriani, head of the Vaccine Development Expert Panel of the Department of Science and Technology.The webinar was very informative and timely that it answers a lot of questions from those in attendance. It aimed to develop awareness among participants about the vaccine and tried to convince those who are still skeptical to avail of it in the future.I believe efforts to open the minds of our people are important nowadays as we remain hopeful of the future. By this time, our people are framing up things that would exactly put them to believe they have a way out, or wait for the time that all of this will be over. But the problem is they also lack the resources to support the needs of their family should this situation continue.Another thing is, while many support that vaccination is our last hope, we still need to convince our people to get vaccinated because it is safe. Recent surveys show that many are not inclined to take the vaccines for some reason. Maybe they are still being haunted by the issues with Dengvaxia in the past and the impression that the vaccines were made hastily.We are also into the waiting game. As we have heard many times that vaccines will be delivered because the government previously signed agreements with manufacturers, there is still no clarity if we will be a priority. Other rich countries, even those places where these vaccines came from, still need enough supply in order to reach the level of herd immunity. Thus, there is a possibility that our vaccination could be delayed and that many things could happen.I doubt we could start this vaccination in the soonest time possible. In the United States for example, on reports of the New York Times, they hope to vaccinate 70 to 90 percent of the population to reach herd immunity. The Philippines will probably need the same percentage of our population in order to be safe from Covid-19. So while the United States and other rich countries are also running after their supply, how soon could we have our own? Maybe just for the sake of giving in to pressures of not leaving the developing countries, some manufacturers will share with us a part of what they have committed to advanced countries.In many situations in the past, we had seen how we stood in the community of nations. We seem to feel the discrimination as a developing country, deprived of resources, respect and yes, this time, the vaccines that we need for our people.It is a sad reality that we will simply be left to the mercy of big countries particularly those where these vaccines are coming from. We hope to understand the same situation they are also facing but while the delay continues, we also put at risk the lives of Filipinos.It could be true that our journey on the vaccines will depend on the vaccine program of other countries because of the supply issue. It could suggest that when they are already stable, we might have just started our full-blown vaccination particularly in the farthest of places in the country. We hope we’re still alive by then.",sunstar

And just the other day, Friday, a ceremonial vaccination program was conducted at the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC) park with no less than its Medical Center Chief, Dr. Ricardo B. Ruñez, along with other volunteer rank and file employees of the hospital being the first recipients of the said vaccine.The 7,800 doses of the vaccine shared to the region come from the first batch of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac Biotech CoronaVac which arrived in the country last Sunday from China. The national government has immediately begun distributing the said vaccines to the various hospitals as well as conducting a ceremonial inoculation in Manila with nurses and doctors, as well as several top government officials, being the recipients.Apart from the arrival of the vaccines from China, the country also received last Thursday, 487,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine thru the Covax facility, a global initiative aimed at equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines led by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and others, and which will be distributed again to the various hospitals the next day, according to the country’s testing czar Vince Dizon, President of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA).So this is where we stand at the moment.

Cecilia Brilliantes once again reiterated the necessity of fast-tracking the listing of residents of the city for the scheduled vaccination program in the locality.In that meeting, it came to the observation of the concerned Barangay Officials, more particularly LIGA President and ex-oficio City Councilor Michael Lawana that in the list of priority population groups identified by the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNiTAG) for vaccination it would appear they (Barangay Officials) have not been listed either in priority A1, A2, A3 which include among others barangay health workers, janitors, nursing aides, and students.Councilor Lawana pointed out that Barangay Officials who remain at the frontlines almost 24/7 in the communities where they serve should also be given the highest priority in the list of priority population groups for vaccination.For better appreciation of this observation here is the full list of priority population groups for vaccination as identified by iNiTAG: A1: Frontline workers in health facilities both national and local, private and public, health professionals and non-professionals like students, nursing aides, janitors, barangay health workers, etc. A2: Senior citizens aged 60 years old and above; A3: Persons with comorbidities not otherwise included in the preceding categories; A4: Frontline personnel in essential sectors including uniformed personnel and those in working sectors identified by the IATF as essential during the Enhanced Community Quarantine; A5: Indigent population not otherwise included in the preceding categories; B1: Teachers, Social workers; B2: Other government workers; B3: Other essential workers; B4: Socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigenous people; B5: Overseas Filipino Workers; B6: Other remaining workforce; C: Rest of the Filipino population not otherwise included in the above groups.Apparently, this must be rectified by the iNiTAG so that it will accurately reflect the status of Barangay Officials as vital frontliners who should also be given top priority in the said vaccination list.",sunstar

It can be caused by a variety of organism including bacteria, viruses and fungi.Symptoms may include difficulty of breathing, coughing, fever and weakness.Aside from weakened immune system, elderly patients with pneumonia are more prone to sever complications, hospitalization and death also due to pre-existing health conditions and illnesses such as diabetes, chronic lung disease, and kidney or heart conditions, among others.In the Philippines, pneumonia remains to be a pressing health concern.Records showed that within the past decade, pneumonia accounted for over 57,000 deaths among Filipinos annually.In 2010 alone, 57,809 deaths due to pneumonia was recorded making it the top five leading causes of death in the country.Vergara, however, said pneumonia is a vaccine-preventable disease. Thus, the government is putting premium on various programs like free vaccination especially among the elderly.In Bacolod City, almost 1,000 senior citizens including persons with disabilities (PWDs) age 50 years old and above have availed of the free pneumonia and flu vaccination yesterday.Other recipients included immune-compromised patients like those with HIV/Aids, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and those underwent organ transplant.Dubbed “Bakunado si Lolo at Lola, Iwas Pulmonya,” the campaign is a collaboration of the local government and various partners including global health care company MSD.It is aimed at restoring vaccine confidence and address misinformation about immunization.Vergara said the immunization is also in support to the efforts of the Department of Health (DOH) in Region 6 which provided the vaccines.“The aim really is to ensure the welfare and health of our senior citizens,” the health official said, adding that pneumonia vaccine is given for free at the health centers “so we are urging our senior citizens to avail such service from the government.”MSD, in a statement, said the partnership with the city government is intended to strengthen public-private sector collaboration in promoting the importance of a life-course vaccination from birth to old age.“MSD has continuously worked to develop and bring forth innovative medicines and vaccines to help save and improve lives for more than a decade now,” it said, adding that “it has been actively supporting local government units build vaccine-resilient communities and informing the public of the benefits of vaccination.”For his part, Federation of Senior Citizen Associations in Bacolod City president Edgardo Superticioso said at least 30 of their members die every month and almost half of the figure is due to pneumonia.The federation is currently comprised of about 40,000 member-elderly from 72 associations in 61 barangays in the city.“This is the day for senior citizens, we are thankful as we are chosen as beneficiaries of this program,” he said, adding that the vaccination program will surely lessen the number of mortality among their members.Meanwhile, also present during the activity are representatives of the DOH, other city health officials, and Councilors Archie Baribar and Cindy Rojas, chair of the City Council committee on senior citizen and health, respectively.",sunstar

But the dynamics are on our government agencies on the process and terms that these vaccines will be purchased and administered to recipients.There is no doubt, the vaccines are the only recourse left for government to protect the people from the coronavirus.Recently, many local government units all over the country already signed a non-disclosure agreement with a British company, AstraZeneca, for the purchase of the vaccines. This is despite no authorization had been issued from the national government even for emergency use. In fact, it is still hazy on what vaccines are now being reviewed that may be available for public use.Just like the many dynamics we had in this country, we don’t know what is going on and what direction we are actually following. It is like we are put in a state where our national and local governments are competing in terms of available policies they could invoke as a reason to justify their actions. Sadly, the state of the people will be used as reasons though in many times they were not consulted in the process of decision-making.In my readings, those countries that have started using vaccines dealt with manufacturers on the state level. In the Philippines, it seemed that initiatives are coming from many sectors and that the national government will just be informed about the choices made on the vaccines.Our situation has gone to a different style. Instead of coordinating these efforts from the national government, LGUs have pursued dealings with vaccine manufacturers for their purchases. This could be a concern of orderliness in the context of our government arrangement that many might have forsaken because of some reasons.On the other side, it is also true that we could not prolong the agony of waiting when we believe there is no way to fight this pandemic than to have the soonest vaccine at hand. LGUs may not be blamed for moving ahead with their desire to protect their people from the Covid-19. Should it be a situation that things will have to be coordinated with the national government, the next thing would be on how long they will have to wait for national agencies to act on the needed vaccines.For now, there is no hint on what vaccine but LGUs have chosen already Astrazeneca for their people. Thus, it shows a disconnect in choices made by our government on the matter of the vaccine.This uncertainty could be attributed to many things. There may be internal dynamics that are left hidden in the public’s eye that only those they consider “authorized” are the ones holding the future of the vaccines. They might think that the more people are confused about these concerns, the more they will be tired to ask questions about many things.For one’s realization, it should not only about the choices of these vaccines. It is also about satisfying the people’s query on its efficacy and safety. I hope we will not be taken for a ride in these matters crucial for our survival and the future of our fight against the coronavirus.Majority of Filipinos are skeptical about the use of vaccines, hence, government is obligated to explain this in forms that would connect down to ordinary individuals.",sunstar

We must make sure we have accessibility and adequacy of vaccine supply,"" Leonardia had said.The CoVaC is tasked to plan, supervise, and implement programs and activities related to the City's Covid-19 Vaccination Roadmap, which is aimed at providing citizens access to the vaccine ""at the soonest possible time with the widest and most realistic coverage possible.""Bacolod was also among the first cities to negotiate for its own Covid-19 vaccines. It already has reserved 650,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines to kick off its vaccination program, making it among the top five cities in the country with the biggest vaccine orders, together with Davao City, Quezon City, Makati City, and the City of Manila.Aside from AstraZeneca, Leonardia is also negotiating with other pharmaceutical companies that are developing Covid-19 vaccines.Last February 5, Bacolod held its vaccination simulation exercises at the Barangay Villamonte gymnasium. Observers from the Department of Health-Western Visayas commended the City's vaccination process for its smooth flow and observance of health protocols.As President Rodrigo Duterte already gave LGUs authority to make advance payments for the vaccines, Leonardia said the City Government of Bacolod is preparing the advance payment of 20 percent, as per contract, of the total cost of 650,000 doses of vaccines it will procure from AstraZeneca.League's effortsAs national president of LCP, Leonardia had led the League in lobbying with the Office of the President to give cities authority to make advance payments to pharmaceutical companies for Covid-19 vaccines.About 300 companies and 39 LGUs from across the country have pitched in for the purchase of AstraZeneca's vaccines. The company is asking for a 20 percent down payment.The LCP adopted Resolution 2021-01 during its Special General Assembly last February 4, appealing to the Office of President to issue an executive order for authority on advance payments.As a result, Duterte signed Presidential Memorandum 51 on February 18, granting authority to LGUs to make up to 50 percent down payment on Covid-19 vaccines.""We are very thankful to President Rodrigo Duterte for the timely issuance of Memorandum Order 51 that will allow cities to make advance payments for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines. This has a direct impact, especially to cities which had earlier signed the multilateral agreement with the Department of Health (DOH), National Task Force Against Covid-19, and AstraZeneca. But this will, more importantly, benefit all LGUs similarly situated."" (PR)",sunstar

NICAVERA,"March 04, 2021","THE business sector is encouraging local government units (LGUs) in Negros Occidental including Bacolod City to unveil their respective roadmap for mass vaccination against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a business leader said.Frank Carbon, chief executive officer of the Metro Bacolod Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MBCCI), said the roadmap is a high-level communication paper that details the strategy and why’s of the vaccination program.It will also show the goals and milestones of the program, Carbon said.“They [LGUs] might have [a roadmap] but they have to unveil and communicate it to the public,” he added.Underscoring the importance of showing the LGUs' mass vaccination roadmap, the business leader said it will allay fears of infection and encourage movement and increase the confidence of businessmen to reopen.“It will discourage profiteers to hoard goods and create artificial shortages and mitigate soaring food prices,” he added.Following the arrival of the first batch of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, a vaccine produced by China-based pharmaceutical Sinovac Biotech on February 28, the national government has begun rolling out the vaccines.Two hospitals in Bacolod City, the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital and Riverside Medical Center, are expected to get an allocation from these Sinovac vaccines for their medical frontliners.It can be recalled that the City Government of Bacolod and Provincial Government of Negros Occidental earlier entered separate contracts with AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines Inc. for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.Bacolod City allotted an initial fund of P300 million to purchase inoculate some 80 percent, or 491,198 individuals out of the 613,997 projected population in 2020.Negros Occidental had set aside P30 million for the procurement of vaccines mainly for medical frontliners.The amount is only good for about 100,000 doses so the province requested for three million doses from the national government to cover its balance equivalent to about 1.5 million population.The city and provincial governments have already made advance payments, at 20 percent, for their respective Covid-19 orders which are expected to arrive by July or August this year.For the local business sector, amid the impending arrival of the vaccines, the LGUs should already have a vaccination roadmap and communicate it to the public.“The roadmap will also point to LGUs the right timing to implement cash for work program and financial assistance to micro businesses,” Carbon said.",sunstar

It is important that we know how many doses of vaccines will be given to us by the national government) so that we can also properly plan pila ang dapat paliton (how many doses of vaccine we should procure),"" the mayor added.She said the National Government cannot pledge or allocate the number of doses to be allocated to the city because they are also waiting for the actual delivery of the vaccines.Duterte-Carpio recently formally signed a contract with British-Swedish bio-pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Inc., which committed to delivering initial doses of its Covid-19 vaccines to the city by third quarter of 2021.But the mayor said the city will still be getting its Covid-19 vaccines from multiple sources since AstraZeneca cannot commit to delivering bulk supply to the city.She added that based on their received reports, some Dabawenyos are hesitant to get inoculated with the vaccine because of safety concerns.However, based on survey by the University of Mindanao-Institute of Popular Opinion (UM-IPO), conducted from December 7 to 19, 2020, only two out of 10 Dabawenyos expressed unwillingness to get the vaccine because of possible side effects, fear of complication, personal mistrust in vaccines, lack of empirical clinical studies affirming the safety of the vaccine, among others.Also, three out of 10 of the respondents expressed uncertainty whether to get the vaccine or not, ""with key reasons of uncertainty such as uncertainty of the efficacy of the vaccines, personal decision to observe the situation first, possible side effects to the body, general skepticism on vaccines and the like.""Duterte-Carpio said the city will roll out an information drive to let the Dabawenyos understand how the Covid-19 works, and how it will affect them.But she said the Covid-19 vaccination in the city will not be mandatory.",sunstar

We would get all the old clothes of our parents and dressed up like cowboys and Indians. We used the headboards as our horses. One of my cousins would always stick out his improvised bow and arrow and would tell me “money or life?” My answer would always be “or” and he would say, “I will take your money then your life.” We would end our little make-believe game with being friends at the end.Today, we are faced with a great dilemma whether to continue with the restrictions to stop the spread of the dreaded Covid-19 virus or to lift the restrictions and declare a “new normal” for economic reasons. We are now being conditioned that the transmission is somehow contained and the cases are low, especially in the province and in the city. Soon, businesses will again start booming. But the authorities warn that while we convert to the “new normal,” health protocols would essentially be part of that norm.We are also made to believe that the vaccine will soon be on our shores and we could surely beat Covid-19. We praise and thank God for giving us people to study and stop the transmission of the virus. We now fervently pray that the vaccine will be shared with all mankind. However, today, we become hesitant and reluctant about this vaccine because of the many news and opinions that come out about its efficacy. I wish that we could be like the other countries that have already started their vaccination programs. We need to put off all politics and shadows of corruption in the whole process of mass vaccination. Only if this administration has the political will and believes in the efficacy of the vaccines, will we not have to worry about anything. But with all the hullaballoos, doubt will always linger.Now, we are faced with the question, “money or life?” Could we answer this question fairly and squarely? If we choose money, then forget all about the health issues and let us all live the same way as before. We can only get back what we have lost economically and financially if we go back to our old materialistic and secular ways. Profit and money are the end of it all at the compromise of life. This was where we were leading before the pandemic came in. I am quite disappointed because it seems that we did not learn lessons from other countries. We seem to like the experience of a second tranche of the virus. I am also confused with what we are doing and saying- they are either contrary or contradictory. We seem to say something but do otherwise. Is this the character of the new normal or is this the aftereffect of Covid-19?If we choose life over money, then we need to be very cautious of everything. The government should be sincere in saving us. The government should have the political will not to make us guinea pigs or laboratory rats to benefit the capitalists in this business we call pandemic. The vaccine is here as a gift from God, let us share it. Let us set aside politics and elections.So, money or life?",sunstar

MGCQ is considered the lowest community quarantine status as per NIATF guidelines.Section 5 (3) of the amended Omnibus Guidelines provides that for areas placed under MGCQ, “[a]ny person below ten (10) years old, those who are over sixty-five (65) years of age and above, those with immunodeficiency, comorbidity, or other health risks, and pregnant women shall be required to remain in their residences at all times.”The amendments are effective beginning February 1. They were announced on January 21. Two days later (Friday, January 23), the Philippine Pediatric Society (PPS) and the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines (PIDSP) appealed to the NIATF to “reaffirm their position not to allow children aged 10 years old and older to go outside their residence.”The PPS and the PIDSP said they remain firm in recommending that children should stay at home with the pandemic still not over.“The EOC Task Force will be waiting for the response of the NIATF to the PPS [and the PIDSP]. We will be waiting until the end of the month for a response and we will be adhering to the national law if no response comes from the NIATF,” said Leonardia, chairperson of the CoVac Council.The mayor also warned that with the new coronavirus strain, “it is better to be safe than sorry.”According to Emergency Operations Center (EOC) deputy for medical Dr. Chris Sorongon, the appeal made by the PPS and PIDSP is an attempt on caution, by preventing possible exposure of children to the virus.This is important, especially since according to Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran, some people are still not observing the prescribed minimum health protocols.“Even now, if you ask our barangay captains, a lot of people are not even wearing masks, especially those 18 years old and above,” said Familiaran, vice chairperson of the CoVac Council.On the other hand, preparations for the mass vaccination in Bacolod are currently being undertaken.

Medel Sr. Elementary School in Barangay Tangub.Dr. Renilyn Reyes, DOH-Western Visayas Family Health and Nutrition Cluster head, said the activity aims to strengthen the advocacy on the implementation of school-based health services such as immunization, deworming and weekly iron and folic acid (WIFA).Under the school-based immunization, all Grade 1 pupils in public schools will be vaccinated with a measles-containing vaccine (MCV) and tetanus-diphtheria (Td), while grade 7 students will receive measles-rubella (MR) and TD vaccines.Female students in Grade 4, aged 9 to 13 years old will also be vaccinated with human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines.The immunization will be conducted in August in all public schools in Western Visayas.Reyes said in Western Visayas, about 118, 350 female students in Grade 7 to Grade 10 will receive the iron supplementation; 123, 771 Grade 1 students for immunization; 78, 981 Grade 4 students for HPV; 155, 314 Grade 7 students will receive MR and TD.She said about 1.6 million students from Kinder to Grade 12 will also receive the deworming tablet.She added the national school deworming is a nationwide effort targeting children aged five to 18 years old (from Kindergarten to grade 12) enrolled in public schools. This is a twice a year campaign held in July for the first round, and January for the second round.Reyes noted that deworming aims to address soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH), considered as a public health problem that has a detrimental impact on children's growth and development.STH can cause anemia, malnutrition, weakness, and impaired physical and cognitive development resulting in poor growth and school performance in children.Reyes said the WIFA supplementation aims to address vitamin and mineral deficiency among adolescents, especially Grades 7 to 10 female learners. These adolescents will be given one tablet or iron and folic acid on a weekly basis from July to September first round, and second round in January to March next year.She said the school-based immunization started in 2014 and they are hopeful that all children should receive the immunization, deworming and WIFA.""We have some problems in terms of consent for the parents because of the previous vaccine controversy, but we would like to highlight that these vaccines and even the deworming and WIFA tablets are different services,"" Reyes added.Reyes disclosed that in implementing these school-based health services, the DOH recognizes the need to intensify collaboration and integration of efforts with the DepEd, DILG, and the Local Government unit to achieve better health outcomes.""As we converge our efforts together with our partners, we hope that we attain our goals and realize our commitment to ensure that every child in our schools is healthier than ever,"" Reyes said.Last year, some parents refused to avail the free immunization program because of the Dengvaxia issue.Dr. Rosalie Deocampo, medical coordinator of National Immunization Program in Bacolod, said this launching is one of those strategies to encourage the parents to have their children vaccinated.She said Bacolod is not affected by the dengvaxia and they are conducting a information dissemination in various schools.""We are conducting the school-based immunization for almost five years already and in previous years, we have a high average and accomplished about 84 percent for the immunization and it's improved to 94 percent,"" she added.Deocampo disclosed that these vaccines have proven safe and effective and the parents have nothing to worry about it.City Health Office (CHO) head Dr. Ma. Carmela Gensoli said the health centers in various barangays were tasked to conduct the immunization with the presence of the assigned doctor.Dr. Ma. Herna Montinola, DepEd Division officer, said that there's a big drop in the number of the students or pupils who have submitted to immunization as well as deworming in Bacolod City.She said in 2017, in the part of deworming Bacolod City was awarded by the DOH-Western Visayas for being one of the four performing division of Bacolod for having a 100 percent target, but with the outbreak of Dengvaxia, it really affected the result.Councilor Em Ang, chairperson of the City Council committee on health, said they are happy that Integrated School-based Health Services was already launched in Bacolod which it includes the immunization, deworming and Wifa.Ang encouraged the parents to avail the free immunization program because it's already established for how many years and it's safe, adding that in private doctors these vaccines are so expensive.

The risk contracting the virus is high for those who have not received the vaccine, especially children below 5 years old, unvaccinated pregnant women and those non-immune person who did not develop immunity after giving the vaccine,” Rana said.“Furthermore, the risk is high in immuno-compromised individuals, those with weakened immune system like those people living with HIV-Aids (Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome),” he added.Rana added that measles, is highly contagious and can be transmitted by coughing, sneezing, close personal contact and direct contact with infected body fluids.The virus remains in the air or in an infected surface up to two hours. It can be transmitted by an infected person four days prior to the onset of rash and up to four days after the rash erupts.“The onset of symptoms ranges from seven to 14 days, averaging ten to 12 days. The first sign of measles is usually high fever which can go up to 40 degrees Celsius. This is often accompanied by runny nose, cough, reddish eyes, and small white spots in the surface of the mouth which we call it Koplick spots. Others will have decrease appetite and body malaise,” Rana said.Even though there is still no specific treatment that kills the virus, Rana said measles can be prevented through vaccination and having a healthy lifestyle.“Measles vaccine is already 50 years old and is proven safe and effective. It is usually given in combination with other vaccines like mumps and German measles,” Rana said as he assured the public of the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine as there are some who are still wary of receiving vaccination due to the Dengvaxia scandal.However, despite that, it was reported by the Public Health Surveillance Division of the DOH that the top reasons as for non-vaccination of measles-containing vaccine were: parents or mother was busy, not eligible for vaccination and the child was sick.“It is also important to mention that vaccinated mothers can also protect their infants, that's why we encourage vaccination to all mothers,” Rana said.In Northern Mindanao, the DOH in the said region reported around 12,000 children have been already vaccinated, however, the number of measles-related cases continues to rise.According to Dr. Dave Mendoza, head of the Regional Epidemiology, Surveillance and Disaster Response Unit, the DOH-Northern Mindanao recorded a total of 499 suspected measles from January 1 to February 17, with seven deaths.Its 222 percent higher compared to the same period last year, Mendoza added.Although, Mendoza is optimistic that the number of measles might decline this summer as health personnel has been catching up with the vaccination levels in the region.",sunstar

Vaccines
Aside from the vaccines that will be provided by the national government, a portfolio of other vaccines are being eyed for Cebu City residents.Casas said negotiations with Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Sinovac were still ongoing.Given that candidate vaccines against Covid-19 are administered in two doses, except for the single-dose Janssen vaccine, Cebu City would need at least two million doses to inoculate its entire population of around one million.Casas said they need to know first the number of doses that will be provided by the national government so they can negotiate to procure the balance.Under the present procurement setup, LGUs may purchase vaccines only through the national government to ensure vaccine equity.Candidate vaccines against Covid-19 are still under development and are not approved for commercial use yet, although an emergency use authorization (EUA) may be issued to allow the use of a vaccine during a public health emergency.So far, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the Philippines has issued an EUA for the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford.
Pfizer vaccine
The government is expecting 117,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine this month, through the Covax facility, a mechanism that ensures global vaccine equity.Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said Monday, that healthcare frontliners from 34 hospitals, including the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) in Cebu City, will receive the vaccine first.Aside from the VSMMC, other hospitals prioritized for the Pfizer vaccine are 32 facilities in Metro Manila and the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.As of Monday, Vergeire said most of these 34 hospitals have submitted their verified lists of priority recipients as well as quick substitution lists.“Some hospitals are still completing their quick subsitution lists,” Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing.The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is administered in two doses 28 days apart to persons who are at least 16 years old but not more than 80 years old.The Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNitag) earlier said the following allocation framework will be followed in the distribution of the Pfizer vaccines: Covid-19 dedicated hospitals, Covid-19 referral hospitals, DOH-owned hospitals, LGU hospitals, hospitals for uniformed services/personnel and private hospitals.The frontline workers in the 34 hospitals belong to Priority Group A1, based on the priority population groups identified by the iNitag for vaccination.

Active cases edged closer to 3,000, totaling 2,993 as of Feb. 14.Cebu Province, which came in third spot on Feb. 13, climbed to second place on Feb. 14, with 909 new cases over the same 14-day period.Cebu Province had 83 new cases on Feb. 14, more than 50 for 13 days in a row.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1883407/Cebu/Local-News/Preparations-for-vaccine-rollout-begin-in-Central-Visayas,Preparations for vaccine rollout begin in Central Visayas,,"January 20, 2021","THE Department of Health in Central Visayas (DOH 7) has started briefing its personnel and local government officials on the impending vaccination program against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) as part of measures to prepare the public for the rollout of the vaccines.It will be the task of the local government units (LGUs) to cascade information down to the barangay level, said DOH 7 Director Jaime Bernadas.Next week, he said, they will engage with the private medical practitioners to ensure that there will be no conflicting information on the vaccination program.“Let us all be united in this, including the private practitioners and specialists, to ensure that the government would not be saying one thing and the doctors would be saying another,” Bernadas said during the Cebu and Mandaue leg of the “Explain, Explain, Explain” campaign of the government on Covid-19 issues in Cebu City on Tuesday, Jan. 19, 2021.In coordination with the LGUs, Bernadas said they will be creating teams of doctors and other health workers who will implement the vaccination program.He also said they have designed vaccination posts, but these are subject to the response of the LGUs.He emphasized the need to prepare the people, educate them and raise their confidence in vaccines by disseminating information.He said this is a “critical time” comparable to that of the finish line of a marathon.Officials have pinned hopes of ending the Covid-19 pandemic on the candidate vaccines. However, studies are still ongoing on whether these vaccines will also prevent the new variants of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Cebu CityIn Cebu City, City Administrator Floro Casas Jr. said the Vaccine Advisory Committee (VAC), of which he is a member, has held initial talks with AstraZeneca and Pfizer. They will also get in touch with other vaccine developers and manufacturers.He said they will procure a vaccine that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).As of Wednesday, Jan. 20, only the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is allowed for emergency use in the Philippines. The applications of AstraZeneca, Gamaleya and Sinovac for an Emergency Use Authorization remain pending.Casas also said they were eyeing to tap medical technology and nursing students for the vaccination program.They have also started looking for suitable venues to ensure physical distancing during vaccination.Casas said they have yet to determine the cold storage facilities that would be needed since these would depend on the vaccine that will be procured.Most of the candidate vaccines against Covid-19 in the market require storage temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, but the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at an ultra-low temperature of -80 to -60 degrees Celsius.The Cebu City Government has allotted P400 million under its 2021 annual budget for the purchase of vaccines against Covid-19. This may be increased through a supplemental budget, Mayor Edgardo Labella earlier said.Vaccine shipmentsThe national government is expecting an initial delivery of 50,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine on Feb. 20. An undetermined volume of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine might also arrive in February, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said earlier this week.Malacañang said Galvez has secured at least 92 million doses of vaccines, as follows: 25 million from Sinovac; 17 million from AstraZeneca; 30 million from Novavax; and 20 million from Moderna.After its initial shipment in February, Sinovac is expected to deliver 950,000 doses in March, and two to three million a month until December.The government aims to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos.Bernadas said half, or 35.1 million Filipinos nationwide, are prioritized for vaccination in 2021. They include the senior citizens, indigents, frontliners and government employees.“The rest will be vaccinated in 2022. By 2023, all Filipinos should have been inoculated,” he added. The Philippines has a population of roughly 108 million.Covid-19 situationBernadas said the current Covid-19 situation in Central Visayas is more manageable compared to the May to July 2020 situation.However, the region is again seeing over 100 new cases of infection in a day in what officials have described as a post-holiday surge.“On Monday (Jan. 18), we had 109 new cases (in the region). It was the seventh or eighth day with over 100 new cases,” Bernadas said.On Tuesday, Jan. 19, DOH 7 reported 134 additional infections.Bernadas said Cebu Province, Cebu City, Lapu-Lapu City and Mandaue City are all showing an uptrend in new cases.Active cases stood at 1,954 on Tuesday while 23,230 have recovered and 1,453 had died.Negros Oriental had the highest active cases at 662, followed by Cebu City with 650, Cebu Province with 387, Mandaue City with 131, Lapu-Lapu City with 105, Bohol with 15 and Siquijor with four.Bernadas also noted that the number of Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms were increasing compared to those who have not developed any symptoms. He did not cite figures.Mild symptoms include fever, colds and cough. Patients who find it difficult to breathe require hospitalization. (WBS / PAC)",sunstar

Christopher “Bong” Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health.He made the announcement while visiting fire survivors in Sitio Superior, Barangay Looc in Mandaue City on Thursday, Dec. 17, 2020.Cebu will include the cities of Cebu, Mandaue, Lapu-Lapu and the whole Cebu Province.Go said President Rodrigo Duterte assured that the vaccine will be available to indigent Filipinos for free.He said the government will also prioritize frontliners and vulnerable sectors like senior citizens.Meanwhile, the senator said he will not change his stand against the in-person classroom setup until the public is immunized with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine.The Department of Education (DepEd) had announced that it would go ahead with limited face-to-face classes in January in areas with no or few Covid cases.However, Go said the final decision to allow face-to-face classes rests on the local government unit.He pointed out that a school will be locked down if a student or a teacher tests positive for the disease.The Mandaue City Government agreed with the Go’s stand, with Mayor Jonas Cortes saying it’s too early to hold face-to-face classes.His executive secretary John Eddu Ibañez said a physical classroom setting might put students at risk.He said the City Government supported the online educational system by procuring tablets for the use of local students.Go said he doesn’t want to stop the DepEd from pushing through with its plans, but he believes the lives of Filipinos are more important.“A life lost is a life lost forever,” he said.The Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday, Dec. 20, reported 1,754 new coronavirus infections, bringing the total case count closer to 460,000.These also brought the total number of new cases in the recent seven days from Dec. 14 to 20 to 10,389, around 8.6 percent higher than the 9,566 new cases reported in the previous week from Dec. 7 to 13.New infections averaged P1,454 a day on Dec. 14 to 20 compared to 1,366 a day on Dec. 7 to 13, the DOH case bulletins showed.For the fourth straight day, Quezon City registered the highest number of new cases followed by Rizal Province.Quezon City had a total of 526 new cases from Dec. 17 to 20 while Rizal had 375 new infections for the same period.On Sunday alone, Quezon City had 163 new cases, followed by Rizal with 104. Other areas with a high number of new cases on Sunday were Benguet (83), Laguna (83) and Bulacan (61).As of Sunday, the total coronavirus cases in the country increased to 459,789.The DOH case bulletin also listed 36 additional mortalities, raising the death toll from Covid-19 to 8,947. The case fatality rate remained at 1.95 percent.There were 8,080 mass recoveries on Sunday based on the DOH time-based recovery strategy, reducing the number of active cases to 21,708 or 4.7 percent of the total case count.Under this methodology, infected individuals with mild or no symptoms of Covid-19 are declared as recoveries if they don’t experience any symptoms in more than 14 consecutive days.The 8,080 recoveries on Sunday were lower by about 13 percent than the 9,269 recoveries on Dec.13.The DOH situation report as of Dec. 18 showed that the top three regions in terms of both active and new cases were the National Capital Region, Calabarzon and Central Luzon.Davao Region had the fourth highest number of active cases and sixth highest new cases. Central Visayas region was in the 10th spot in terms of both active and new cases.The Philippines remained in the 28th spot among countries with the highest number of cases based on the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center tracker.The tracker also showed that more than 76.3 million people have been infected worldwide and roughly 1.68 million had died from Covid-19 as of Dec. 20.

Problems at city’s EOC resolved. Which vaccine and when? A waiting game’: Casas,PACHICO A. SEARES,"February 05, 2021","SITUATION ON COVID SPIKE. Retired general Melquiades Feliciano, Visayas chief implementer of the national task force against Covid-19, told the Cebu City Council Wednesday, February 3, that the increase to double-digit figures in positive cases in the city in January, from single-digit numbers in December, were caused by:(a) Christmas activities and other mass gatherings of people and relaxed enforcement of health protocols during the holidays;(b) Failure of the city’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) to “adjust immediately” to the increase in infections.BACKLOG, CORRECTION AT EOC. Feliciano indicated logistics problem and “affected” morale at EOC, which he said resulted in slower response with “intervention” programs, especially extracting positive cases and moving them to an isolation center.As of Wednesday, in his briefing to the City Council in a virtual regular session, Feliciano said there were 400 infected persons who still had to be isolated.Councilor Joel Garganera, deputy chief implementer at EOC, said Thursday, February 4, the backlog reached at one point to 1,800 un-isolated positives. That was about two weeks ago when infections started to rise to three-digit figures. Isolation centers such as the Noah Complex at South Road Properties were then already filled up. Delay in isolating one infected person could affect an entire family or household, Feliciano said.But corrections were made, the retired general -- whom, with his wife, Cebu City honored last November as the city’s first adopted couple – informed the councilors, thanking the city officials for the prompt response to the emergency center’s problem. More isolation centers have been opened or re-opened. Personnel earlier taken out from EOC were restored.EOC, Feliciano said, is now “back to its original form.” And “we hope we will be able to control” the spread of infections in one to two weeks, Feliciano said. Encouraging indicators in the local upsurge are the still low mortality rate and “only 25%” in critical care utilization rate.INQUIRIES ON VACCINES. The city councilors had a flood of questions about vaccines for Covid-19, which apparently reflected the interest of their constituents in the issue, including these:[1] Which brand of vaccine has the national government selected? How safe will it be?[2] When will the vaccines arrive in Cebu for the vaccination to start?[3] What does the national government require of the local government in the vaccination program? What equipment will the LGU rent or buy?[4] Can the private sector purchase its own vaccines? Will private professionals be tapped to help the government administer them?IATF’s Feliciano had no answer to the most curiosity-driven questions: what brand and when. He doesn’t know or won’t tell the vaccine of choice or the date of the first shipment.He repeated what IATF officials said before: an LGU or a private firm or group may buy its own vaccines but with the participation of the government in a tripartite agreement.He gave a glimpse though on rollout preparations, such as the vaccines going into the regional hub and from there to the LGU’svaccination center storage facility and conducting the inoculation at 10 gyms or covered courts.TALKS WITH SUPPLIERS. Atty. Floro Casas Jr., city administrator or manager, informed the City Council that the Vaccine Board created by Mayor Edgardo Labella made exploratory talks with Pfizer and AstraZeneca but still had to seal any agreement.Casas said the mayor is made to understand that the national government will supply the vaccines and the LGU will buy only for the gap that it decides must be filled. Feliciano, on the other hand, told the City Council that the national government will take care of the vaccines, without stating any limit on volume or number. IATF, however, reportedly will set the allocation for each area or region.Casas said the local government awaits the decision of the central government. “It’s a waiting game,” Casas said. The city has been saying it is “ready to buy” but has not bought any vaccine yet.Vice Mayor Mike Rama, presiding officer, said he agrees with Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia that getting the vaccines “is not a race.” That seems to contradict “the science of it,” adopted by most other countries in the world and even some LGUs in the Philippines, namely that the faster a community achieves “herd immunity” by vaccination, the more lives are saved.LGU’S SPENDING. Councilor Raymond Garcia, minority floor leader and finance committee chairman, wanted to know from Feliciano whether the city must provide freezer or storage facility for the vaccines and supply personnel at vaccination sites.Garcia needed information to decide how much more funds his committee will recommend for LGU’s role in the vaccination phase.Like answer to other questions on vaccines, Feliciano’s reply: Wait for the guidelines, which will be out in a week or son.Earlier, the mayor and the City Council agreed to add in a supplemental budget another P100 million to the P400 million it had earlier included in the 2021 general appropriation ordinance approved last December. That would be on top of the P3.5 billion the Sanggunian advanced to the mayor for expenses related to the anti-Covid campaign, liquidation of which the City Council has been pressing for but still has to get.How much the city spends for the vaccines depends on how much the national government delivers, which actually cannot be determined yet from any of the IATF officials’ statements, which are not yet specified in writing.VM, COUNCILORS GIVE THEMSELVES BIGGER ROLE. Vice Mayor Rama and the City Council have been seeking larger function in the anti-Covid response, not just legislating funds for it. And in this week’s session, it decided to give that to themselves.On mass motion, the Sanggunian created a group of “convenors” led by VM Rama as chairman, Casas as vice chairman (at first it was co-chairman), and a number of councilors, purportedly to adopt a “plan of action,” including an information campaign on inoculation, and oversee the rollout and administration of the vaccines.Rama told the City Council he “bluntly” told the mayor that while the chief executive was still not physically present at City Hall, the vice mayor, “as chairman of the Sanggunian committee on health and its committee on the anti-Covid campaign,” would lead the vaccination part of the city’s response to the health crisis.",sunstar

It will also contain a priority list of recipients.In a press conference on Wednesday, Jan. 27, 2021, Labella said the vaccines that the City Government will purchase will be on top of the vaccines allocated by the national government for Cebu City.“Cebu City is ready (for the vaccination program),” Labella said.He said vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. has asked him for a list of individuals who will receive the vaccine first.In a previous report, Labella said medical frontliners will be the first to get vaccinated, followed by the police and military forces, senior citizens, and those considered as “poorest of the poor.”During the Cebu City Council’s regular session Wednesday, Councilor Dave Tumulak urged the executive department to purchase cold storage facilities and portable containers capable of storing vaccines.In his privilege speech, Tumulak said Zuellig Pharma’s cold storage facility at the North Reclamation Area is capable of storing the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which needs to be kept at -80 to -60 degrees Celsius to remain stable.However, Zuellig might not be able to accommodate all the vaccines that will be delivered to Cebu City, Tumulak added.He also urged the barangays to start looking for areas that can serve as vaccination centers subject to the guidelines set by the Department of Health (DOH).Among the potential vaccination centers are the University of San Jose - Recoletos (USJ-R) Basak campus and ACE Medical Center. Tumulak asked that these institutions lend a portion of their properties to serve as inoculation sites.Tumulak further urged the executive department to allocate funds for the hospitalization of those who might suffer from allergic reactions to the vaccine.These funds will be used to augment the PhilHealth benefits and City Hospitalization Assistance and Medicines Program (Champ).

SEARES,"December 16, 2020","THE COVID VACCINES. The Cebu City Government will buy anti-Covid-19 vaccines, allotting P500 million for the initial purchase.Mayor Edgardo Labella promised last August 5 to buy the vaccines ""once they are available."" Last Tuesday, December 15, he said the money is authorized under the city's investment plan and will be covered by a supplemental budget in January.That outlay will pass. Neither the opposition BOPK nor Vice Mayor Mike Rama, who has encouraged and led a ""fiscalization, no-rubber-stamp"" stance in the City Council, has expressed opposition to the purchase. A councilor even asked, where's the appropriation for vaccines?THE LONG WAIT. To Filipinos anxious to get their inoculation shot, amid the news that in United Kingdom and the US, the vaccines are already being distributed and administered, the waiting could be longer than they thought. No inoculation yet in December or even January and February. Maybe in March, basing on ""Vaccine Czar"" retired general Carlito Galvez Jr.'s Vaccine Plan.Per Galvez's road map, this December is within the period for studying and reviewing the vaccines available and for clinical trials and approval by the cluster's panel of experts. January to March: for procurement, shipment, distribution and deployment.And Cebu City Hall needs to wait for the guidelines from the national task force, particularly the Vaccine Cluster under it. Any contract would involve three parties: the city, the supplier and the national government.PRIORITIES. Galvez's promise to Cebu City -- announced by Mayor Labella with the permission of the vaccine chief who is also chief implementer at the IATF -- was a sparse, single sentence: ""Cebu City will have a priority.""To the mayor, it must be high up in the ladder of priorities as, Labella said, he had goose bumps (""nanindog akong balhibo"").With no specifics however, many city residents might not share his excitement yet. They still don't know which vaccine (the pricey Pfizer/BioNTech or the much cheaper AstraZeneca) will come although the Philippines was to sign last November 26 a contract for two million doses of AstraZeneca Plc.Or when the vaccines will come, and when they do, who will get the shots first? There would be a scramble for the initial two million doses.That has brought attention and interest to the list. A Cebu City public information office feature purportedly enumerates the people who will get vaccinated first. As Mayor Labella said, the guidelines still had to come.And Galvez in his marching order is only to get the consensus on priority beneficiaries; he does not decide alone.Despite President Rodrigo Duterte's ""distrust"" of local officials, Galvez had said LGUs cannot be kept away, especially in identifying who will get the vaccines in the first shipment.AS TO THE CONTROVERSIAL BUDGET for next year, it would pass but it is not certain how would it look after passing through the City Council wringer. VM Rama, who has been hyping up the posture of a ""unified and independent legislature,"" indicated Wednesday, December 16, the councilors would approve the 2021 budget.Earlier, Mike Rama had said he wouldn't want a reenacted budget for next year (the 2020 budget recycled). In Wednesday's session, he told Councilor Raymond Garcia, chairman of the committee on budget and finance, who presided the budget hearing, that the VM and the mayor had a talk the day before on a number of issues, which must have been resolved as he indicated the budget would be passed on or before December 23, its last session day for the year.At the December 15 press-con, Mayor Labella said he would expect and hope that the councilors were being ""objective."" The following day, VM Rama didn't dash Labella's optimism, saying he wouldn't make the budget impair the mayor's work. (Actually, he said in typical Mike Rama prose, ""We will not have a budget that will make the mayor not handle the city in the manner that he wants."")UNCERTAIN ELEMENTS. How would the city's 2021 budget look if it survives the City Council review? It would depend:[1] If Rama and his band of ""fiscalizers and no-rubber-stamps"" have found satisfactory the mayor's liquidation of the P3.5-billion lump sum outlays for Covid response, or they have not, but decided to let it go.[2] If the lawmakers would insist that the budget be ""pandemic-purposed"" and must address flooding, social concerns and food production, and public safety and order.Slashes have been proposed, notably by Councilors Noel Archival, Alvin Dizon and Leah Japson (all BOPK) to department heads on such items as seminars, travels and public events and the like. Check out if they're still intact in the final version.Top indicators of City Council sentiment would be (a) the size of the cuts on the P10.8 billion total and (b) whether proceeds from the sale of South Road Properties lots are used for the budget, funds that Mike Rama would not want touched unless used to pay for the SRP loan.",sunstar

Residents who prefer these brands over the Sinovac vaccine may wait until these become available in the second half of 2021.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said Cebu City and Davao City, aside from Metro Manila, may be able to purchase these vaccines because of the presence of cold storage facilities.Labella said a Swiss company in Cebu City has a facility that can store the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which requires storage temperature of between -60 and -80 degrees Celsius.

That’s why I don’t agree with the statement that we cannot be choosy,” Labella said.He was referring to a Malacañang statement that Filipinos don’t have any choice but to take the Sinovac vaccine before the other vaccines become available.Labella said he was aware that many residents are not comfortable with the Sinovac vaccine, which has been reported to be less effective against Covid-19 than the other vaccines in the market.Once this is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA), however, Labella said he would be willing to be the first to be inoculated with the Chinese vaccine.ChoicesAs of Wednesday, Malacañang said only the Sinovac vaccine would be available in the first half of the year. Aside from the 50,000 doses in February, the government is also expecting 950,000 doses in March, and two million to three million doses monthly until December.Labella said it would be the task of the Covid-19 Vaccine Board to identify those who want to avail of the Sinovac vaccine and those who are willing to wait until the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines become available.The board will also recommend the brands of vaccine that the City would be purchasing, Labella said. One factor that will be considered is a vaccine’s efficacy rate.The board is composed of City Health officer-in-charge Jeffrey Ibones, infectious disease specialist Bryan Lim, a representative of the Philippine College of Physicians, and Junjie Zuasula, head of the DOH 7 Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (RESU).The City has allocated a P400-million budget for the Covid-19 vaccines. A P100-million supplemental budget is set to be passed to augment this.Labella said the target is to immunize for free 70 percent of Cebu City’s population. A vaccination plan based on the national priority scheme will be drawn up.LCP resolutionsMeanwhile, the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) in Cebu has passed a resolution urging the national government to allow local government units (LGUs) to purchase their preferred vaccine brands.This was one of three resolutions that the LCP Cebu passed recently. Another resolution requested the national government to allow the LCP to take part in the committee in charge of vaccine procurement while the third asked the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) to create a masterlist of the priority sectors that will receive the vaccine.Labella, who chairs LCP Cebu, said they met with Galvez on Jan. 12 to discuss updates on vaccine procurement.Labella said some LCP officials “got upset” during the meeting and insisted that the LGUs be allowed to choose and directly order the vaccine from the supplier.Under the present setup, LGUs have to procure the vaccine through the national government. Agreements are signed among the LGU, the National Task Force Against Covid-19, DOH and supplier.Labella said Galvez explained that this setup allows the government to monitor the efficacy of the vaccine and verify the track record of the manufacturer or developer.Up to 10.598 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine are available for advance purchase by LGUs. As of Wednesday, more than 23 LGUs have placed orders with AstraZeneca ranging from 40,000 to 1.1 million doses.Cebu City, however, has not signed such an agreement.In Talisay City, Mayor Gerald Anthony Gullas Jr. said he wants to directly negotiate with the vaccine manufacturers.He also ordered the creation of a vaccine board, which will be composed of representatives from the City Health Office, City Administrator’s Office and the city’s finance department.Gullas said the board will be tasked to assess the vaccines, determine which brands to purchase and identify priority sectors that will receive the vaccine first.

BAJENTING,"January 30, 2021","AUSTRALIA Ambassador to the Philippines Steven Robinson has assured that Cebu is one of the priority areas in the Philippines for the 500 million Australian dollars (AUD) in aid his country has committed in three years to support access to safe and effective Covid-19 vaccines for the Pacific and Southeast Asia.Robinson reiterated the strong diplomatic relationship between Australia and the Philippines, as the two celebrate the 75th anniversary of their bilateral relations this year, citing his nation’s intent to help in the purchase and rollout of the vaccines here.“The Australian government has committed half a billion dollars to Southeast Asia, a proportion of which is also coming to the Philippines. This is for the purchase of vaccines but also for the provision of technical assistance in the rolling out of vaccines,” Robinson said in an interview on Friday during his two-day visit in Cebu.He said Cebu is very important in the vaccine distribution, being the second largest city in the Philippines.Robinson said he is pushing to establish more economic opportunities beneficial for the two countries.“We have a development assistance program which is worth about AUD82 million (P3.02 billion) every year. Much is focused on the Visayas and Mindanao but because of the pandemic, we decided to reorient that development assistance program to focus on three things: health, prosperity and security in Mindanao, and economic recovery,” he said.He said they’re focused on the recovery programs so all of their assistance programs are being channeled to consistently help the national government’s objectives.Robinson said he is set to meet the country’s top officials tasked in the Covid-19 response to talk about Australian assistance.“It (funds) goes to the provisions of vaccines, which is the critical issue for the Philippines, and the inoculation program. Because the country has such a diverse geographical spread, more than 7,000 islands so you’ve got to move the vaccines to ensure everyone is vaccinated and then there’s an education campaign to try to get people to accept the vaccine,” the Aussie envoy said.",sunstar

Based on the results of its phase 3 clinical trials, the vaccine is 95 percent efficacious against Covid-19.Loreche said, however, that it’s not a guarantee that an individual will no longer contract Covid-19.Cebu City casesMeanwhile, she said it’s still too early to blame the rise in infections in Cebu on the B.1.1.7 or United Kingdom (UK) variant.Regardless, she said people should continue to comply with the minimum public health standards and quarantine protocols. A virus has the opportunity to mutate every time it is transmitted.“People have forgotten that we need to really have that close adherence to the public health protocols because there is no medicine for this,” she said.The new variants detected in the UK and South Africa were reported to be more contagious.Aside from strict compliance to health safety protocols, Loreche also said they will revisit testing policies if more new variant cases are found.She also said the DOH 7 was amenable to suggestions to use two face masks and stressed the need to wear face shields.As of Feb. 8, the active cases in Cebu City went up to 2,218, including 151 new infections. The Covid-19 death toll remained at 706 as no additional deaths were reported. There were 29 new recoveries, pushing the total to 10,701.The active cases in Cebu City comprise around half of the 4,465 active cases in Central Visayas, the DOH 7 case bulletin showed.Cumulative cases in the region since the start of the pandemic increased to 31,019 as of Feb. 8, including 1,493 deaths, 25,061 recoveries and 4,465 active cases.Info driveAt the Cebu City Health Department (CHD), officer-in-charge Jeffrey Ibones said they were focusing on an education and information drive to convince the public to get vaccinated not only against Covid-19 but also against other preventable diseases.He admitted, however, that this is difficult to achieve because of the Dengvaxia controversy. Dengvaxia is a vaccine against dengue fever, which was found in 2018 to cause severe illness in individuals who have not contracted the dengue virus.Ibones said audio-visual materials explaining the vaccination process and benefits of the vaccines will soon be available in barangay health centers and government offices.He also said they were drawing up a micro vaccination plan for Cebu City based on the national roadmap.During the regular session of the Cebu City Council on Feb. 3, 2021, National Task Force Against Covid-19 deputy implementer for the Visayas Melquiades Feliciano said different clusters have been formed to be part of the vaccine operations center.Ibones said the clusters included in the vaccine operations center have been meeting at the second floor of the old Sacred Heart School for Boys building, which is being eyed as the local vaccination operations center (VOC).Ibones said his office has yet to coordinate with the DOH on the requirements for a command center for the vaccination program.The Cebu City Government was given until Feb. 10 to submit its vaccination plan and activate all local VOCs.Other local government units given the same deadline are Metro Manila and Davao City.

Gwendolyn Garcia said she will prioritize the immediate needs of her constituents, instead of making a move to allocate funds for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines.Several local government units (LGU) in the country have set aside funds, while others have secured contracts with the vaccine manufacturers.“For me, it’s premature. It’s not a race,” Garcia told reporters on Thursday, Jan. 14.The governor further said even if the Capitol would set aside a budget for the vaccine purchase, it would not get the supplies right away because the purchase still has to undergo several processes set by the National Government.“If I tell you I will allocate P1 billion for the purchase of the vaccine, that will just make good headlines. But how to proceed with it? I will be subjected to existing national government guidelines, and just this point: the National Government has appropriated so much and targeted 70 percent of the population,” Garcia said.The Philippine Government has signed an agreement with Chinese firm Sinovac for 25 million doses of the latter’s vaccine CoronaVac.Recent reports stated that a group of Brazilian scientists reported CoronaVac’s efficacy to be just over 50 percent, way lower than the 78 percent level of efficacy announced last week.The National Government also signed agreements for 30 million doses of the American firm Novavax’s vaccine and 15 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through tripartite deals with LGUs and private firms.But Garcia will focus first on improving the Capitol’s services in towns amid the pandemic.“At this point, I’d rather focus our funds on what our people really need right now to help them pick up the pieces of their lives and livelihood, to improve our infrastructure,” she said.The governor said the Provincial Government will again distribute vitamins to the barangay workers and frontliners to strengthen their immunity.Independent cities’ moveThe independent cities of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu have moved for the vaccination of a targeted portion of their population.The Mandaue City Government has reserved P200 million to complement the vaccines that will be allocated to the city by the national government.Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes’ executive secretary John Eddu Ibañez said the funds will be taken from other sources.Ibañez said if the vaccines provided by the National Government won’t be enough, the City Government will use the P200 million reserve funds to purchase additional doses.Mandaue City, according to the 2015 census, has a population of 362,654. However, Ibañez said the city has around 450,000 residents, and he said 20 percent of the population will be prioritized in the vaccination program.The Mandaue City Hall has a medicine storage facility, and it could be used to store the Covid-19 vaccine, according to Ibañez.The vaccine for the city, he said, may arrive in the second or third quarter of this year.The Lapu-Lapu City Government, on the other hand, is considering the Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Sinovac, Sinopharm and two other firms for its vaccination program.City Mayor Junard “Ahong” Chan said there is no reason to rush the vaccine purchase, saying the City has to choose the affordable and effective one.City Epidemiological Surveillance Officer Grace Mary Carungay said 60 to 70 percent of the city population will be vaccinated. The 2015 census states the city has 408,112 residents.Chan has tasked the City Health Office to prepare a vaccination plan.The cities of Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue will prioritize people 60 years old and above and frontliners. Mandaue City’s other priorities in the vaccination program are the children and teachers, while Lapu-Lapu City will include indigents, public utility vehicle drivers and vendors.Expert’s reminderAs the supply of Covid-19 vaccines has yet to arrive in the Philippines, infectious disease specialist Dr. Bryan Albert Lim said it is important for LGUs to focus on the preparations for the transportation of the vaccine, census on who will administer the vaccination, and a plan on how to monitor the vaccinated persons for adverse effects.The country has had no prior experience of mass vaccination in a pandemic, he told the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas in an online discussion last Jan. 13.The physician also appealed to the public to refrain from spreading misconceptions about the vaccine and its procurement. / ANV, NDT / KAL, KFD, WBS",sunstar

The first batch of 7,200 doses of CoronaVac in Central Visayas arrived in Cebu on Tuesday, March 2.The vaccines were administered to health workers at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) and DOH 7 officials among others.Retired Gen. Melquiades Feliciano, Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID)-Visayas chief, who was among the first to be vaccinated during a ceremony at the VSMMC on Thursday, March 4, said he and Loreche are “living proofs” that it is safe to be vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine.“So, I am enjoining everyone to be part of it,” he said during a briefing with Loreche held at the Visayas Vaccine Operations Center in Oakridge, Mandaue City.He described his vaccination as similar to his experience when he took his flu and pneumonia shots in August 2020. He said he did not feel any adverse effects after the inoculation.Feliciano was vaccinated along with VSMMC Chief Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr., Dr. Juanito Tiu of St. Anthony Mother and Child Hospital, Dr. Pythagoras Zerna of Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital and Loreche.He said a total of 50 individuals in Central Visayas were vaccinated with the Sinovac vaccine on the first day of the rollout.For her part, Loreche said among the most common adverse effects of vaccination are headache, increase in blood pressure, a feeling of light-headedness and fatigue.“But of course, if you experience worse effects than those such as rashes, allergies, and secondary to this, difficulty in breathing, then that’s another part of the adverse events that will require a really very close monitoring of your symptoms,” Loreche said in a mix of Cebuano and English.“That’s why we have 30 minutes to monitor after you are vaccinated,” Loreche added.Covax
Meanwhile, the second batch of vaccines donated under the Covax facility will be delivered to the Philippines after the first batch of 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca (AZ) vaccine is consumed, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said.“I was told by the World Health Organization that if we are not able to consume this, the second tranche will not arrive,” Galvez said in Pilipino after the arrival of the first Covax shipment on Thursday evening, March 4.A total of 4.584 million doses of AZ vaccine have been allotted for the Philippines in the first round of allocations of the Covax facility.Galvez said before the end of March, Sinovac will also send one million doses of the vaccine that were procured by the government.President Rodrigo Duterte, who welcomed the AZ vaccines, thanked Covax for the donation.He also urged Filipinos to get vaccinated, saying it is a necessary tool to overcome the pandemic and further open up the economy.“We may not be out of the woods yet, but we are making progress and the end is in sight. With your cooperation, we will overcome this pandemic and ensure the health and safety of everyone,” said Duterte.He assured that the government will immediately distribute the vaccines to the communities.As of March 3, over 9,000 people have been inoculated using the Sinovac vaccine.As of Friday night, Central Visayas logged 7,093 active Covid-19 cases. Cebu City recorded 3,453 active cases while Cebu Province logged 1,242 active cases.In a press briefing at the VSMMC on Thursday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the recommendations of the IATF to Central Visayas include increasing of surveillance capacity of local government units, ensuring all close contacts be traced and isolated within 24 hours, conducting third generation contact tracing for cases positive for mutations with potential clinical significance, increasing isolation capacity for Cebu City, Cebu Province, and Lapu Lapu City, and increasing utilization of the temporary treatment and monitoring facilities in the region.He noted that though cases in Cebu have gone up in the first months of 2021, Cebu City, in particular, has managed to maintain a manageable critical care utilization rate.

I told him we are ready to augment whatever the national government will provide.”In the City’s Annual Investment Plan (AIP) which was approved in October, P500 million was allocated to buy the Covid-19 vaccine.In the 2021 annual budget, the Cebu City Council approved an amount of P350 million intended for the vaccine.Labella said should the budget be not enough, a supplemental budget will be made to augment it.Labella also said Galvez told him that all local government units (LGUs) that will purchase Covid-19 vaccines will have to course it through the national government.He said a tripartite agreement among the supplier, national government and LGUs will have to be observed.He said this is a way to do away with black markets and prevent the selling of fake vaccines.Meanwhile, following the report of a traveler from Manila who tested positive of the new variant of the coronavirus when she arrived in Hong Kong, Labella said the enforcement and implementation of the 14-day quarantine for travelers coming from Manila will be stricter.This has been the protocol of the city since 2020 and it will only be more strictly implemented this time, he said.The Emergency Operations Center (EOC), meanwhile, recorded its highest number of Covid-19 cases since the start of 2021, on Jan. 5 when there were 38 cases logged.Cebu City Councilor Joel Garganera, EOC deputy chief implementer, said since Dec. 29, 2020, the city has been logging double-digit numbers of cases.Garganera said this is now the result of the movements of the public in December such as gatherings and parties or from the health care workers, among others.Garganera, though, emphasized they have not recorded a case who got the infection from the Misa de Gallo, as far as the contact tracing is concerned.He said the spike of Covid-19 cases in the city is expected until the next few weeks.

SEARES,"January 15, 2021","AT A GLANCE, from what Friday's Capitol meeting and news sources told us:[1] Local governments may buy vaccines of their choice but the national government must be a party to the sale, per policy accord among the world's vaccine manufacturers.[2] While Cebu City and Mandaue City have appropriated money for their own vaccines, not one Cebu LGU has yet negotiated with and signed a deal with any supplier.[3] No person, including health workers and other frontliners, can be forced to be inoculated. But details on that, along with the person's waiver of liability by the LGU for adverse effects of the vaccine, are not yet available. Other requirements may include the certification of one's doctor on fitness to be inoculated.[4] Cebu, with the National Capital Region and Davao, will be given priority as management strategy for key cities in the rollout of the first shipment of vaccines.CEBU CITY, CAPITOL POSITION. Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia -- in the January 15 meeting at the Capitol with mayors of towns and component cities -- restated the position she laid down last December 17, 2020: she will wait for guidelines from the national government.The national government's policy at the start: through President Rodrigo Duterte and the Inter-Agency Task For Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID), the central authority will choose and buy the vaccines. Any local government unit (LGU) that wishes to buy its own, on top of what the central government procures, shall enter into a three-party agreement with the vaccine supplier.In sum: Wait for Manila's diktat.Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella said last December and restated this week that he'd wait for the guidelines, trusting the assurance of vaccine czar Carlito Galves Jr. of IATF that Cebu would be given priority. Labella has been waiting since then even as he created a panel to choose the vaccine and prepare the groundwork for its use. Earlier, last December 23, the City Council included in the city's 2021 budget P400 million for the vaccine, with the plan to add P100 million in a supplemental budget.Governor Gwen stuck to her position of not tackling the matter of vaccine yet. Friday, January 15, she said she would not announce how much Capitol would spend for the vaccine, focusing instead on Capitol programs to help small businesses and the economy recover.'IMPATIENT LGUs' DID NOT WAIT. Other LGUs however chose not to just watch and wait. More than 30 in the list released Wednesday, January 13, had started scouting for and negotiating with vaccine suppliers as early as last year. ""Most of them"" were reported to have ""inked the deal"" already, making the other local governments in the country look like they had some catching up to do.IATF apparently has been taking its time to issue guidelines on procurement by LGUs. Malacañang and vaccine czar Galvez responded only amid the swelling sentiment among the LGUs that chose to be active in procuring their vaccine, topped by the startling disclosure that the president's adviser on entrepreneurship, Joy Concepcion, led a private group to secure the first shipment of 2.5 million vaccine doses to this country. (The private organizations that put up the money included Cebu's Aboitiz Foundation).Last December 26, Manila announced that a local government may buy its vaccine of choice, provided the government is the third party, conforming to the policy set by the vaccine suppliers.President Duterte, acknowledging the success of some LGUs in clinching their own deals, said, ""Many local governments opted to buy on their own because they have the money and they can choose the vaccine they want.""The vaccines an LGU purchases, DILG and DOH made clear, shall be for those persons who are not included in the national government's priority list.PRO-ACTIVE LGUs, SOUND BITES. Senator Francis Tolentino, chairman of the Senate committee on local government, lauded the President this week for ratifying the initiative of some LGUs in procuring vaccines.He defended the legal right of LGUs to make the emergency purchase, citing the Local Government Code and the procurement reform law and asserting that no current law or the president's Executive Order to the Food & Drug Authority on EUA (emergency use authority) prohibits LGUs from buying vaccines on their own. The requirement about the tripartite agreement is imposed by the vaccine makers; Manila is just conforming to it.Senator Tolentino called the zealous LGUs ""pro-active."" Governor Gwen said the activism would draw sound bites and headlines but she would rather concentrate on the more pressing problem of nursing the province's economy back to health. Getting the vaccine is largely the national government's job. Besides, she said, they wouldn't know how many doses Capitol needs to buy until they are told its share from the Manila allotment. As to controlling Covid-19 transmission, the governor would stick to the health protocols and boosting immunity, including ""traditional"" methods.WHO DID BETTER. One can't tell for now which LGUs took the better option. But the outcome of the race for the vaccines, whether a local government joins it or just watches and waits, won't be determined until the next few months.Developments on the coronavirus -- its containment or further spread and how access to vaccines makes the difference -- may tell which public officials took the better path in coping with the pandemic.",sunstar

The Covid-19 pandemic is an enemy that no single country big or small is able to defeat by itself. The pandemic can only be overcome by joining efforts and resources of all responsible nations. This is why we are inviting partners and friends to participate in the final stages of development of the vaccine. We are interested in all forms of cooperation from carrying out additional research and clinical trials to joint production. Russia has already signed agreements with several countries to produce the vaccine and over 20 others have made requests to purchase it.So what exactly does Russia offer to the Philippines?Igor Khovaev: As I said, we believe that finalizing this vaccine is highly crucial not just for Russia, but for the entire world. While we welcome contributions from all the parties concerned, primarily we would like to develop Sputnik V in cooperation with our close partners like the Philippines. In this regard, we offer the following areas of collaboration:* exchanging information on development and clinical trials of the Russian vaccine;* conducting clinical trials of the vaccine on the Philippine soil in order to verify its efficiency and safety and to complete the relevant registration procedures in full compliance with the local legislation;* supplying the vaccine to the Philippines;* sharing technologies and manufacturing the vaccine on the Philippine territory.Please note that this is not some kind of a commercial undertaking. It would have been much cheaper and easier to conduct clinical trials in Russia but we want to make sure that the vaccine is safe and we want our partners to make sure of that as well. I am pleased to say that Russian and Philippine experts have already started exchanging opinions on the technical aspects of conducting the abovementioned trials in the Philippines.Russia reportedly has agreed to transfer technology of the vaccine. Does Russia see the Philippines as capable of manufacturing Sputnik V?Igor Khovaev: Absolutely. If we did not believe so, we would not have offered it to the Philippines in the first place. This transfer of technology will open up new horizons for bilateral economic and scientific cooperation because the technology in question can be used in a whole variety of fields. Not to mention that it will likely make the Philippines a regional hub for the anti-Covid-19 vaccine.How much of the vaccine will be produced here in the Philippines and what would be the approximate price of one inoculation?Igor Khovaev: Provided the establishment of local production is successful, the volume of the vaccine to be produced will be determined by the Philippine Government in accordance with the needs of the population. On the other hand, the Philippines might potentially supply the vaccine to other countries within the region.While the price of one shot has not been established yet, what I can remind is that prices of pharmaceuticals in Russia are usually lower than those in Western Europe or the United States. Therefore, I have all reason to believe that the vaccine will be quite affordable for Filipinos, especially if it is produced locally.Is there any certainty on when the first batches of the vaccine will arrive in the Philippines?Igor Khovaev: The Russian Direct Investment Foundation, which is in exclusive charge of development, distribution and production of the vaccine abroad, is not inclined to waste time. We are ready to work as fast as it is acceptable for our Philippine partners.Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has personally announced the vaccine even before the third phase of trials has been completed. What makes the Russian Government and scientists so confident of its success?Igor Khovaev: From the first day President Putin emphasized that the safety of the vaccine was the top priority. Therefore, although we are quite optimistic with regard to the success of phase three, what is at stake here for the President and for everyone else is the health and security of our people. In addition, I have to say that failure of phase three is hardly a possibility. Russian scientists chose the safest method of delivering the coronavirus spike. The technology used for the creation of the Sputnik V vaccine is the same that was used for the Russian vaccine for the Ebola Fever and Mers virus. Both of them were highly successful, efficient and safe.We Russians are highly responsible people. We do not like risky undertakings. One of our favorite sayings is “Trust, but verify.” That’s why we suggested to carry out clinical trials here, so that our Philippine partners could verify the efficiency of Sputnik V.Russia has always been very strong in the sphere of vaccines. We have a serious technological and scientific edge. Our priority of course is the health of our population but we are more than willing to share our accomplishment with others to fight a common foe, which is Covid-19.What was the first reaction of the Philippine Government to the Russian offer?Igor Khovaev: We highly appreciate the statement by President Duterte, who expressed the willingness to be the first to test the Russian vaccine. I cannot help but admire his decisiveness and his readiness to do what it takes to overcome a crisis.Overall, the Philippine Government has been enthusiastic about our offer. I would like to convey my appreciation to the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Department of Science and Technology and the Food and Drug Administration and my personal thanks to Hon. Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, chair of the Philippine Senate Health and Sports Committee; to H.E. Teodoro Locsin, secretary of foreign affairs of the Philippines; and to Hon. Secretary Fortunato de la Peña, Department of Science and Technology. Apart from that, we are getting a lot of positive feedback from Philippine parliamentarians and business people. A lot of them are asking how they could help to expedite the process of bringing the vaccine to the Philippines.Along with all positive comments, it is hard not to notice some skepticism coming from a number of well-known politicians and scientists around the world. Do you think they have any actual reason to be concerned?Igor Khovaev: There has indeed been a flood of skeptical comments mainly from Western countries. On the one hand, I think it is normal because it is only human nature to be skeptical towards something new. A long time ago, people were skeptical about the fact that the Earth is round and that it evolves around the Sun.On the other hand, a fair share of the skepticism regarding the safety of the Russian vaccine is nothing but an attempt to undermine the results of the work of Russian scientists for political and commercial reasons. It is an open secret for any unbiased observer.I recall an American expert stating, “There is no way the US would test it [the Russian vaccine] on monkeys, let alone people.” In fact, I cannot help but think that those monkeys have more decency and morals in them than the people who purposefully try dissuading others from testing and using the vaccine for reasons that have nothing to do with saving lives and stopping the pandemic. All those allegations are nothing but indecent competition moves. It is quite sad to realize it because this is a time for the global community to join forces, not to try undermining each other attempting to exploit the pandemic for commercial gain. I suppose that true people of science and medicine should be above it especially in such trying times. So I would like to recommend Western official and researchers to be more modest and less jealous. If they choose competition over cooperation, we are more than ready for it but competition has to be fair.Another interesting detail is that along with criticizing the Russian vaccine, Western countries tried to lure over scientists from the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology where Sputnik V was initially developed.In one of his recent press briefings Mr. Kirill Dmitriev explained that technologies similar to the one used to create Sputnik V have been employed by the US Army for producing various vaccines for soldiers since the 1970s. This makes all the skepticism regarding Russia’s ability to apply it as a basis for creating a vaccine against Covid-19 sound somewhat hypocritical. They seem to forget that Russia is accountable for a whole constellation of technological breakthroughs of the 20th and 21st centuries including the exploration of outer space, lasers technology, nuclear power for peaceful purpose, hypersonic missiles and many others.Unlike Western criticizers, we have never tried to sling mud at others and to discredit the work of foreign researchers. On the contrary, we believe, that given the current crisis, the more vaccines will be developed the better. We wish best of luck to other countries developing their own Covid-19 vaccines.The only reasonable complaint that we have heard so far is that Russia has not provided the relevant data on the first and second phases of trials. By now, it has also become irrelevant. Comprehensive data on trial results in Russia (phase one and phase two) have already been submitted to the competent Philippine agencies. We have nothing to hide. Our offer is based on real products rather than dreams.In conclusion, I want to stress that any disaster is not only a challenge but also an opportunity to establish new ways of collaboration and to bring our two nations closer to each other. It will allow us to build new bridges of friendship that will serve countless generations for decades to come. It will become our lasting legacy. This is a unique chance that we have no right to miss.",sunstar

She assured the public that they will hasten this.Loreche said there is a need to assess the region’s storage capabilities and they are doing inventory on the number of freezers that have a 220-degree capacity and those ultra-low freezers that have -70 degrees.“We will try to act fast on this so that when the vaccines are ready, we have a place for them,” she said.She said there are institutions in the region that have these capacities including some molecular laboratories and pharmaceuticals, but she cannot divulge specifics yet pending negotiations.As of now, she said, those who are administering available vaccines and those barangay health emergency response teams (Bherts) are qualified to do the vaccination.“We cannot be hiring additional personnel just for the vaccination program. We will be talking with all our personnel and we are conducting retraining and partnering with certain institutions that signified intent to join the vaccination program,” she said.Loreche said there will also be a series of meetings with doctors, training of trainers and activation of Bherts.She said they also intend to have a simulation of the vaccination rollout starting from registration to actual vaccination and the measures to be implemented should there be adverse effects secondary to vaccination.She said there are various types of vaccines available, none of these is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration. Pfizer vaccine though has been issued an emergency use authorization. (WBS)",sunstar
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1836116/Cebu/Local-News/Couple-blames-infants-death-on-vaccine,Couple blames infant's death on vaccine,KATE F. DENOLANG,"December 13, 2019","AN INFANT died a day after she was vaccinated at the Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital in Barangay Jagobiao, Mandaue City.Parents Crisela Toniacao and Johnnel Abello were still in shock and couldn’t believe what happened to their second child, who was one month and 25 days old.The couple told SunStar Cebu that Toniacao had a high fever when she gave birth to her baby through a cesarean section. The baby got sick and was given an antibiotic. Toniacao returned with the baby for a follow-up checkup and was told her baby’s fever had subsided and she was normal.READ: Probe into infant's death set as DOH tries to quell panic, doubtsWhen the infant was six weeks old, she caught the couple’s first child’s cough and was again brought to the doctor, who prescribed medicine for one week.The infant should have been immunized by then, but the doctor told Toniacao to wait until the infant’s cough was gone.When they returned the following week for a checkup, the doctor said the infant was normal and was ready to be immunized in a week’s time.Toniacao said the last time she administered cough medicine to her daughter was on Nov. 28, 2019. On Dec. 4, she had the infant vaccinated.According to Toniacao, they arrived at the hospital at 10 a.m. The attending nurse was allegedly busy with his phone and just weighed her baby and proceeded to inject one vaccine in each of the infant’s legs and administer an oral vaccine, she said.Toniacao said she was shocked when the nurse injected the vaccine without sterilizing her baby’s legs.She shared her suspicion with her partner that the nurse might have wrongly immunized their baby, who wouldn’t stop crying since the injection.“My daughter shook while she cried,” Abello said in Cebuano. He said their daughter’s left leg was kicking while the right leg trembled. The right leg was swollen and hot. Their daughter then developed a fever, he said.They tried to contact their pediatrician but the latter could not be reached.The couple decided to give the infant paracetamol at four-hour intervals starting at 6 p.m. At 2 a.m., they were awakened by the infant’s crying so Toniacao nursed her to put her to sleep.At past 6 a.m., they noticed that their daughter was not responding and had blood coming out of her nose.Toniacao said their daughter still had a pulse when they brought her to the Maayo Medical where the medical staff tried to revive her. They injected something in the infant three times to help her heart pump. The doctors also asked the couple’s permission to install a tube to support the infant’s breathing, which they gave. However, Toniacao said they noticed blood flowing into the tube from her daughter’s mouth.The doctors decided to send the child to the Seamen’s Hospital. When they got there, the doctors injected something into their daughter to get her pulse, to no avail.“The doctors did everything to try and revive your daughter, ma’am,” Toniacao quoted one of the medical staff in Cebuano.After their daughter was declared dead, Abello said they wanted her to undergo an autopsy to determine the cause of death. He asked doctors for help and even went to funeral homes, private hospitals and also to the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) 7.Two doctors in a private hospital in Mandaue City were willing to conduct the examination, but they needed the guidance of a medico-legal officer. The couple requested one from the Mandaue City Health Office, but the person in charge was out of town.Abello said he found a doctor who would autopsy his daughter but the doctor, who was also in charge of the Philippine National Police Crime Lab, was in Leyte and would not arrive in Cebu until Dec. 7.While they waited for the doctor, Abello said the funeral home asked them if they wanted their daughter injected with formalin and placed in a coffin. He replied that they were waiting for the NBI to check their daughter’s body.After NBI 7 personnel visited their house and took a photo of their daughter, the funeral home contacted them again and advised them to place the infant in a coffin.The couple said they agreed to have their daughter injected with formalin after the doctor who would conduct the autopsy advised them to do so as long as no blood would be extracted.On Dec. 6, the couple was told the doctor would arrive on Dec. 9.The funeral home told them it had to extract their daughter’s blood so “it would not be rotten.” It fetched the infant’s body and extracted her blood.When informed of the procedure, the doctor told the couple he couldn’t guarantee the result of the autopsy would be accurate since the blood had been extracted.According to Abello, the funeral home also suggested writing down “convulsion” or “natural death” as cause of death and the couple agreed. The couple also signed a waiver.However, the parents continue to suspect the vaccine might have caused their daughter’s death. Abello told Sunstar Cebu that they were still willing to have their daughter undergo an autopsy to put their suspicions to rest.Meanwhile, Dennis Adlawan, administrative officer of Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital, denied the allegations.“Every time we do the immunization, we make sure that the baby is well, the vital signs are okay. Then that’s the time we give the immunization,” he said.He said there were other infants who were immunized on the same day as Abello and Toniacao’s daughter and they didn’t suffer their daughter’s fate.He said it was possible the vaccine had nothing to do with her death. The infant might have choked during feeding, especially if her head was not elevated, he said.The nurse in charge of the immunization, according to Adlawan, has been in practice for almost 20 years. He believes that what the nurse did was according to hospital standards.Adlawan said he couldn’t get a full statement from the nurse since the latter is out of town.Adlawan told SunStar Cebu they already reported the case to the Regional Epidemiology Surveillance Unit (Resu) and they are waiting for its feedback.He said their management is willing to coordinate with Resu and with the couple for the infant to be autopsied as they also want to know the real cause of death.Adlawan hopes this case will not discourage parents from having their children immunized since vaccines are important to human health, adding that the public should not make any judgments until the autopsy results come out.Toniacao and Abello’s daughter was buried at the Manila Memorial Park in Liloan, Cebu on Thursday, Dec. 12.",sunstar
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1886745/Cebu/Media&,Seares: Criticisms on news report of OFWs vaccinated abroad but tested positive in Cebu. Did media get the story wrong?,PACHICO A. SEARES,"February 22, 2021","""Why post a headline saying 'OFW from UAE tested positive even if ... vaccinated?' The vaccine was never meant to prevent you from getting the virus; it prevents you from dying if you do get the virus. Why can't the media get that? Are you trying to scare people or make a sale?"" -- From a Facebook post, February 20, 2021""I read in a newspaper a few days ago this story that said 'Two vaccinated OFWs get Covid.' The story is patently wrong because it gives the impression that anti-Covid vaccines no longer allow a person to get the disease."" -- From a newspaper column, February 22, 2021THE Facebook comment clearly complained about the headline, quoting the allegedly offensive heading. The newspaper column referred to the news story, but still quoting a headline.Both didn't like the effect of the news: It could ""scare people,"" said one. Or ""give the wrong impression"" about the vaccines, said the other.The fact is the story itself gives vaccines a bad name. Media must have known that but still reported it, responsibly enough by giving the explanation for what happened and what it meantThe headlinesA check on the news stories (published February 18 and/or February 19) showed these headlines:[1] OFW vaccinated vs. Covid, tests positive for virus (SunStar);[2] 2 vaccinated OFWs who tested positive both asymptomatic (Freeman/PhilStar);[3] Returning OFW from UAE tests positive for Covid-19 despite vaccination (Inquirer/CDN);[4] 2 OFWs vaccinated vs. Covid-19 in UAE, Canada test positive for virus (ABS-CBN);[5] Vaccinated OFWs in Cebu test positive for Covid-19 (CNN).The core factsTwo basic facts that the above headlines uniformly contained: One, the overseas workers -- one, a male from United Arab Emirates and the other, a female from Canada -- and were previously vaccinated abroad. Two, they were later tested positive in Cebu.Those are core data that cannot be omitted from the headline without making it fatally incomplete. An editor of Morning Times, a Cebu City daily in the sixties and seventies, once headlined a story with two words: ""Blast fishing."" Colleagues who asked what happened and why the news made it to Page 1 got this reply: A fisherman used a dynamite, killing himself and hundreds of ""bolinao"" or small fish. The Times headline didn't offend anyone but it did not give the gist of the news.The Covid news headline contained the gist of the story but like many other stories on the pandemic required some explanation. But the explanation cannot all be tucked into the newspaper headline although the digital versions get more space and thus can give more facts in the headline.What's right with the storyWas the story ""patently wrong""?The basic facts of the two OFWs having been vaccinated abroad and having been tested positive in Cebu were not disputed. The source of the story was Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, chief pathologist and spokesperson of the Department of Health-Visayas. She had the expertise and the authority to speak about the news development.Did the story miss relevant information?Dr. Loreche gave details on the travel of the two OFWs and their inoculation, including the kind of vaccine, doses and dates they were given, as well as health protocols such as their quarantine upon arrival.And the story, in the versions I read, included the explanation by Loreche that ""getting vaccinated does not mean that the person will never be infected with Covid-19."" She said the vaccine ""helps prevent from developing a more severe illness."" And the results in the case of at least one OFW, she added, are ""good since the patient did not develop severe illness,"" an indication that the vaccines probably worked.The SunStar story, for one, spent its first six paragraphs on Loreche's explanation on how the infections probably occurred.The story in ABS-CBN also contained the steps the DOH was taking to isolate and treat the patients to avoid transmission. And Loreche's appeal to the public ""not to get scared of getting the jabs.""Could've done, could do betterThe headline reflects the story. And in the OFW story, the headlines of the various media outfits did just that.Could the headline writers have done better? With more space and time, they could've and still could.Rappler, in its February 18 story, headlined thus: ""Does Mandaue OFW's positive Covid-19 test mean vaccine failed? No, it doesn't."" Apparently though it was updated, very much doable as the news cycle keeps moving, allowing more time for more reporting and longer assessment of the story. Freeman/Philippine Star in a February 19 story added a third information in the headline: both patients were asymptomatic.While work force in many newsrooms has been depleted, capacity and technology have increased. The continuous news cycle and the format of the news carrier enable round-the-clock correction of error and improvement on reporting and editing. Media can quickly change if the slip shows.Counter-balanceNews from the established news organizations have remained more credible than most social media comments. Facebook asks ""What's on your mind?"" and not ""What credible news do you have?""As to errors, they have always hounded even organized news media, despite their mechanism and experience on news gathering and gate-keeping. The saving grace is that most own and correct their mistakes.And no, a slip by one or two newspapers or news media sites does not make ""the media"" a failure. And the mistakes, unless ignored and unexplained or un-corrected, do not spell doom for communication and the community. And most errors are not deliberate; otherwise, media would be shooting their own foot.To many people, organized media -- whose work also appears on digital platforms -- remain a strong counter-balance to the peddlers of false information elsewhere.",sunstar

GALARPE,"August 08, 2020","A VACCINE against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been developed in Russia and its Government, in a proposed cooperation to the Philippines, is ready to supply the Philippines with it.Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev in a virtual press conference on Friday, Aug. 7, 2020, said the proposed cooperation was submitted to the Philippine Government through the Department of Foreign Affairs this week.He said Russia is awaiting the response of the Philippine Government.Khovaev announced that procedures for the administrative approval of the “safe and effective” Covid-19 vaccine have all been set by the middle of August 2020.The Ambassador said at least 20 countries, like India and some European countries, have expressed interest in the vaccine and officially confirmed their cooperation.Khovaev, was unclear on the kind of cooperation proposed by Russia to the 20 countries.However, in its proposed cooperation to the Philippines, three areas were identified: Cooperation through clinical trials if the Philippine Government finds it necessary, supply of the vaccine, and localproduction of the vaccine in the Philippines.“We, Russians, are ready to closely cooperate with partners in order to defeat Covid-19,” Khovaev said.Khovaev said this is a unique opportunity to substantially improve the bilateral partnership of Russia and the Philippines.Russia now has 875,378 Covid-19 cases as of Aug. 7, 2020. It is the fourth country with the most number of Covid-19 infections globally, next to the United States, Brazil and India.VaccineThe vaccine was created by the Moscow-based Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology and financed by the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).According to the RDIF, the sovereign wealth fund of Russia, the vaccine’s distinct characteristic is its ability to reduce the time needed for a person to develop immunity fromthe virus.The vaccine’s first clinical trials were conducted in the middle of June 2020.Massive production is expected to begin in Sept. 2020, the RDIF said.The preclinical studies on monkeys and hamsters confirm the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine, RDIF added.Khovaev said the vaccine was tested on volunteers and even on the CEO of the RDIF, his wife and parents. All of them are reportedly doing well.He said the development of the vaccine was quick because it is a modified version of a vaccine used to fight other diseases.He added that Russian scientists also developed vaccines for Ebola and MERS-CoV.WHOMeanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) in a press briefing said there are general guidelines, regulations, and rules on how to deal with the safe development of vaccines.According to WHO’s guidelines, vaccines have to go through three-phase trials before they could be licensed.The Russian vaccine is still working on the third phase of its trials.",sunstar

Margaret Keenan, 90, was the first to get a jab and Filipina nurse May Parsons got a bit of the limelight for doing the job.The United States has not done so yet as the Food and Drug Administration is still assessing vaccine candidates, though the virus continues to threaten lives. A White House spokesperson, noting of the winter months, was not so reassuring, stating that the pandemic will be “the worst event that this country will face, not just from a public health side.” The Johns Hopkins University data revealed that the average daily infection in the US is approaching 200,000 at the latest.And the Philippines? While most countries have made advance orders for the vaccine long before its availability, Congress is still debating on the budget. It is reported that the country has yet to finalize its order of the vaccine. One report said the government is still evaluating on whether to order the vaccines from China or Russia and 10 other suppliers. With the high demand for the vaccine and the limited capacity of manufacturers, it may well be that the Philippines is at the tail end of most of the suppliers’ lists.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, citing a best-case scenario, said a vaccine would become available between April and June 2021, and that it may not be until late 2021 or early 2022 for the government to obtain a vaccine for local distribution.If we make Britain’s rollout as a starting point, the Philippines will have its first jab four months late. According to the World Health Organization report 63 on the Philippines dated Nov. 25: “In the past weeks, there seem to have been a decrease in daily reported cases, deaths and recoveries by as much as 25%.” At that time the data revealed: 422,915 infected and 8,215 confirmed deaths. While the numbers pale in comparison to the United States, we simply can’t remain complacent.Already, people are wanting to move on with their lives. In New Zealand where I live, it is back-to-normal, though border restrictions remain. While there are still Covid-19 cases, these are confined in quarantine facilities for citizens, residents and a few exceptions coming from overseas. There has been no community transmission for some time. The same is true in Taiwan whose efficient public health infrastructure and disciplined public prevented a national lockdown that New Zealand adopted.Other than New Zealand and Taiwan, the Covid-19 Global Response Index mentions Senegal, Iceland, Denmark and Saudi Arabia as models in disease management and prevention.The pandemic tested the abilities of national leaders and the capabilities of their citizenry in coping with crisis.

Because this will have an effect, unsaon nato pag-budget (how will we budget)?” said Garcia.Feliciano said the national government has no definite guidelines on the vaccination program, but he is sure that the national government will be the one to communicate with the logistic companies for the transportation of the vaccines and the LGUs’ only concern is to carry out the vaccination.Despite being in the dark, the City has to prepare its vaccination program now.Feliciano said the City can start by identifying basketball courts that will serve as vaccine posts.According to their estimates, a covered court, with 39 personnel at each site, can accommodate up to 700 individuals a day.In 10 months, a total of 700,000 individuals will be tested, he said.Each vaccination site should have four nurses, one doctor, barangay tanods, Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams and policemen. It should also have people to man registration and to serve as support staff.Feliciano said the City should work closely with the Liga ng mga Barangay, whose members can help with registration and scheduling.He said different clusters have already been identified to ensure there is no overlapping of tasks. These are:
Vaccination cluster in charge of overseeing vaccination in the identified vaccination sites;
Cold chain cluster in charge of monitoring patients for side effects of the vaccine;
Supplies and logistics cluster in charge of chairs and tables in vaccination sites;
Transport cluster in charge of transporting vaccines to vaccine sites;
Registration cluster in charge of overseeing registration, including identifying priority sectors;
Information and education program cluster in charge of educating the public about the vaccine and to convince them to get vaccinated; and
Communication hotlines and telemeds cluster in charge of monitoring individuals after vaccination.
Feliciano said the Vaccine Operations Center is also being organized. (JJL)",sunstar

Two floors will be utilized — the ground floor as the vaccination area and the second floor for the registration.The healthcare frontliners at the VSMMC have been prioritized for vaccination due to the rising cases of infection in Cebu City.SimulationThe DOH, together with the Office of Civil Defense (OCD), Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and VSMMC, conducted a simulation of the vaccination procedures on Feb. 9.OCD 7 Director Marlou Salazar said some procedures needed to be improved such as transport of vaccines from the plane to the reefer van, how the vaccines were handled, convoy movement, and receiving the vaccines at VSMMC.“These are the major events that should be improved. In general, we have to improve our system,” said Salazar.Bernadas also said devices that monitor the temperature should be visible during transit. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at -80 to -60 degrees Celsius during transit.During the simulation, it took 70 minutes to bring the vaccines to the VSMMC from the airport, said DOH 7 spokesperson Mary Jean Loreche.Loreche said a specific timeframe must be set for the unloading of the vaccines at the airport and at the hospital.“This was highlighted yesterday so all of these must be in place so that the temperature of the vaccines shall be preserved as it comes and during transit,” said Bernadas.Overall, Bernadas said the simulation exercise was “successful.”Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales said the government targets to complete the vaccination program in 10 to 12 months, provided vaccines are available.Gonzales said Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Michael Lloyd Dino has decided to put up a vaccine action center at Oakridge where a daily briefing, including education and information efforts about the vaccine, will be conducted by Loreche.Gonzales said the center will serve as venue for all the coordination meetings related to the vaccination program as well as a database facility.Covid-19 beds in Cebu CityIndependent research group Octa Research warned that Covid beds utilization in Cebu City hospitals could reach the critical level of 70 percent in two weeks.Bed occupancy is still manageable at 40 percent as of Feb. 7, higher than the 25 percent a month ago.The group said that while they are confident that Cebu City and the province are now “better prepared” to deal with the current increase in cases, the possibility of the more infectious B.1.1.7 or United Kingdom variant spreading is a “game changer” as this will require more aggressive interventions.In its Feb. 9 report, the group said Cebu City averaged more than 120 new cases daily from Feb. 1 to 7, a 30 percent increase from the previous week.It also said the positivity rate, or the number of positive results from the number of samples tested, has increased to 10 percent in Cebu City. The attack rate jumped to 11.11 from 10 per 100,000 population.These factors, Octa Research said, classify Cebu City as a high risk area per DOH guidelines.The positivity rates in the cities of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu were higher at 15 percent.On Wednesday, Loreche debunked rumors that Cebu already had a confirmed case of the South African variant of the coronavirus.What Cebu has, she said, is only one confirmed case of the U.K B.1.1.7 variant, the 54-year-old male overseas Filipino worker from Dubai who has a residence in Talisay City. He was asymptomatic and already declared clinically recovered before he was released from isolation. (JJL / WBS)",sunstar

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1886407/Cebu/Local-News/Second-vaccinated-OFW-tests-positive-for-Covid-19,Second vaccinated OFW tests positive for Covid-19,,"February 18, 2021","THE Department of Health (DOH) 7 will conduct an antibody test to determine the current level of immunity of the 25-year-old female overseas Filipino worker (OFW) who received a dose of the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Canada.This, after the female OFW still tested positive for Covid-19 upon her arrival in the country.Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, DOH 7 spokesperson, said the antibody test will determine the individual’s Immunoglobulin (IGg) level, an antibody found in blood and other body fluids that protect the body against bacterial and viral infections.The 25-year-old OFW is the second reported case involving individuals who still tested positive for Covid-19 despite having received the Covid-19 vaccine.The first case was a 43-year-old male OFW from Mandaue City who yielded a positive RT-PCR test despite having received two doses of the Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a country in the Middle East.Loreche said the 25-year-old OFW received one dose of Pfizer vaccine on Jan. 13. She arrived in Cebu on Feb. 9, then underwent the required quarantine period.As part of the improved protocol for international arrivals from areas or countries with confirmed cases of Covid-19 variants, the female OFW underwent swabbing on the fifth day of her quarantine, which fell on Feb. 14. Her test yielded positive results.As the 25-year-old OFW was immediately quarantined upon her arrival in the country, Loreche said there was no need to conduct contact tracing. Loreche said the OFW will have to finish her quarantine period prior to her release.
OFW from UAE
Meanwhile, Loreche said the DOH 7 is also conducting an investigation to determine if the sample from the 43-year-old male OFW from UAE who tested positive for Covid-19 even after receiving a complete dose of Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine will fill the criteria for genomic sequencing in the Philippine Genome Center (PGC).The sample must have a cycle threshold of 30 and below.“We need to be able to satisfy that and once we already have this, then we will determine if the sample has to be sent to PGC,” she said.The 43-year-old OFW from Mandaue City had his first dose of vaccination in his workplace in the UAE on Dec. 12, 2020. He had the second dose on Jan. 2, 2021.He arrived in Cebu on Jan. 5; then he was released on Jan. 20 after completing the mandatory 14-day quarantine.As the male OFW was quarantined upon his arrival, Loreche said they did not swab him; however, because he had to go back to his workplace, he was swabbed on Feb. 8. His result was released on Feb. 9, and it was positive.The individual, Loreche said, has been asymptomatic throughout his stay in Cebu. But four of his household members also tested positive.Considering that the protocol requiring swab tests upon arrival and on the fifth day of the quarantine was not yet implemented when he arrived, the individual from Mandaue City was not swabbed during his 14-day quarantine, unlike the 23-year-old female OFW.“As to transmissibility, it would be too early (to say) that the positivity of his household members was from the positive individual. We need more study analytics for this,” she said.Separate inquiryThe Mandaue City contact tracing team will conduct a separate investigation on the case of the OFW from Mandaue City, said lawyer Julius Caesar Entise, head of the contact tracing team.Entise said the investigation would lead them to possible reasons on how the OFW got infected even after being vaccinated twice and the possible location of the transmission of the virus.The OFW and his family are still under home isolation. All of them have experienced mild symptoms of Covid-19.He said two out of seven members of their family tested negative for Covid-19. The two members who tested negative were isolated from those who tested positive.Entise said the family of the OFW is constantly communicating with their doctor.
MCCI confidence
Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) president Steven Yu said he remains confident that the Mandaue City Government will be able to handle the Covid-19 case stemming from the OFW.“The city government has been consistent in testing, tracing and treating affected barangays. Those who tested positive including certain OFWs are isolated, monitored, treated and their close contacts are being traced,” he said.Yu said city residents are always reminded to adhere to health and safety protocol by wearing masks and observing social distancing.
Not ineffective
Loreche, however, said she did not see the vaccination of the male OFW as ineffective.She said among the positive contributions of the vaccine are the prevention of severe disease and this is what happened to the male OFW—even though he tested positive, he remained asymptomatic.The vaccine was successful in helping prevent clinical disease as the individual never developed any symptoms, said Loreche.As to preventing transmission, which is the third role of the vaccine, Loreche said this is something that they still need to discover by getting reports and studies from the Covid-19vaccine manufacturers.“There is an important thing that we also have to think about—that immunity can kick in later. This is a very new vaccine. Whatever vaccine we receive, it may take a while before our bodies develop the antibodies or the defenses that are needed so that when you get exposed to Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19), then your antibodies can work against that invading pathogen,” she said.
Positive for Covid-19 variant
Meanwhile, Loreche also announced that a 53-year-old male OFW from Dubai, UAE who has a residence in Talisay City, Cebu tested positive for the U.K B.1.1.7 variant.The RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test was conducted in Manila on Jan. 17 and the result came out two days later.Loreche said the patient was quarantined in Tarlac. He arrived in Cebu on Feb. 7, and he went home to Talisay City on Feb. 8.
No reason to panic
She said there was no reason for the public to panic in this case as health authorities had been able to contact, trace and isolate the individual.As the individual was tested in Manila, the DOH 7 has no intention of including him in its tally chart of variant cases, Loreche said.

Mayor Labella trusted IATF's Galvez, was 'still waiting' as other LGUs clinched the deal.",PACHICO A. SEARES,"January 13, 2021","A NUMBER of Cebuanos have made some noise about Cebu City lagging behind other local governments in the scramble for vaccines against Covid-19.Mayor Edgardo Labella in his proposed budget for 2021 and Vice Mayor Michael Rama in the City Council review and approval of the appropriation ordinance made sure that it included P400 million for the purchase of vaccines. Rama also wangled the mayor's promise to add P100 million in a supplemental budget.They were not goofing on their job. Yet the mayor seemed to have fumbled on the next phase of the work, which was the scramble for the vaccines. Early on, our officials must know that two-thirds of the vaccines produced would go to the affluent countries first and the rest of the supply would be fought over by the rest of the world.Mayor Labella appeared to have trusted the people in Manila a bit more than necessary, without getting a place in the long line for the vaccines.Still awaiting go-signalCebu City's plan to buy vaccines, on top of what the national government would allocate to the city, was unwrapped third quarter last year yet.The mayor announced the plan on August 5, 2020. Almost four months later, on December 15, Labella said Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the country's vaccine czar and chief implementer of the Inter-Agency Task Force for Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID), ""assured"" him the city would get an ample supply of the vaccines due to the national government. Last Monday, January 11, the mayor said the city was ""ready to buy"" and was waiting for the IATF rules.Being ready to buy, alas, is not enough. It is even distressing to Cebuanos who watch other LGUs already waving contracts, awaiting delivery while our city still has to join the queue.Signed or negotiatingThe LGUs with already-signed deals include the cities of Bacolod, Baguio, Caloocan, and Dagupan, all with AstraZeneca.Mayor Labella still has to tell Cebuanos: (a) why he is still waiting for the IATF rules when Baguio, for one, already signed a multipartite agreement that includes the national task force and DOH; (b) why many other cities have already been coordinating with pharmaceutical companies for access to Pfizer and AstraZeneca.A list published Wednesday, January 13, said that over 30 provinces and cities have already allocated funds to buy the vaccines and ""most of them"" have already signed with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.That list with AstraZeneca contracts includes: nine from National Capital Region, led by Makati City with one million doses and Manila, 800,000; three from Luzon; two from Visayas -- Iloilo City, 600,000, and Ormoc City, 270,000; and two from Mindanao -- Zamboanga City, 400,000, and Oroquita City, 120,000. Others in the AstraZeneca list but did not discloses the volume of their purchase include Bacolod City and Davao City.'Playing God'The vaccines issue has spawned other issues that affect not just local public officials, particularly in Cebu, but also their constituents:[1] VACCINE OF CHOICE. The nation entrusts to the president and the IATF, central authority and coordinator in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the decision on quarantine measures and choosing vaccine to use.People are puzzled however why and how the Philippines secured 25 million doses of the vaccines from China's Sinovac, the first batch scheduled to be delivered this February. Sinovac's vaccine is generally reputed to be (a) only 50 percent effective, (b) one of the two most expensive in the market and, Senate President Vicente Sotto III asked this week at a committee hearing, (c) still has to apply for EUA or emergency use authorization. Senator Ping Lacson said Sinovac had not yet applied and ""yet you concluded a contract with Sinovac for 25 million doses.""[2] 'PLAYING GOD.' Any purchase of vaccine by a local government from the supplier requires the national government to be the third party. A number of senators asked why this is so, why LGUs and private companies are given more room. ""Do you want to play God?"" asked Senator Franklin Drilon. Maybe not but the rule complicates and delays, as in the case of Cebu City, the rollout of the vaccines.If that is a requirement, as Mayor Labella was repeatedly told by Manila, why and how have many LGUs gone around it and directly dealt with AstraZeneca? Galvez explained that the national government only signs a ""term sheet"" to ""lock in the logistics so that they can start."" It is ""a supply agreement to determine the term of payment and delivery, he said."" Was Mayor Labella told that? Why was the mayor, as of January 11, still waiting for IATF go-signal?[3] RIGHT TO REJECT. The citizen's right to reject a vaccine he does not trust is upheld by Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque. But he implied that Filipinos who get the vaccine for free have no choice.Beggars cannot be choosers? The rejection is itself a form of choice. And wait, this is taxpayers' money, not from the officials who crafted the policy.Significantly, the pandemic does not take away citizens' right to question and assail government decisions that defy plain good sense.",sunstar

While most have promised protection against severe Covid-19, only a couple have initially shown efficacy against the new Sars-CoV-2 variants. The vaccine from Sinopharm, China’s state-owned pharmaceutical firm, is not among them.
Timeline
Loreche said the OFW, a 43-year-old male from Mandaue City, received the first dose of the Sinopharm vaccine in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Dec. 12, 2020 and the second dose on Jan. 2, 2021.Lawyer Julius Caesar Entise of the contact tracing team of the Mandaue City’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC) said the OFW arrived in Cebu on Jan. 5, 2021 and completed his mandatory quarantine on Jan. 20.He was swabbed on Feb. 8 as a prerequisite for his return to the UAE and the result came out positive for the virus on Feb. 9.Entise said five of the OFW’s seven household members also tested positive for Covid-19. The family is undergoing home isolation.“Considering that the house is qualified for isolation, they were isolated in the same household. They opted for home quarantine,” Entise told SunStar Cebu in a phone interview Wednesday night.He said “two to three” family members have cough, one of the common symptoms of Covid-19.
New cases
On Wednesday, DOH 7 reported a total of 521 new Covid-19 cases in the entire Cebu as follows: Cebu City, 245; Cebu Province, 113; Lapu-Lapu City, 93; and Mandaue City, 70.The number of active cases in Cebu City went up to 2,668 despite the 158 recoveries, while those in Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu increased to 623 and 466, respectively. Mandaue reported 55 recoveries while Lapu-Lapu had zero for the day.In Cebu Province, the active cases decreased to 1,029 despite the 113 new cases because there were more recoveries at 141.One additional death each was reported in Cebu and Mandaue while three mortalities were reported in the Province.Together with the 10 new cases in Bohol, 2 in Negros Oriental and 1 in Siquijor, there were a total of 534 new infections in Central Visayas Wednesday.DOH 7 reported a total of six additional deaths and 361 recoveries in the region, leaving 5,240 active cases.Meanwhile, Loreche said more than eight of 10 active cases in Cebu City were asymptomatic as of Feb. 15.Of the 2,601 active cases on Feb. 15, she said 2,285 or 87.85 percent were asymptomatic.The current critical care utilization rate (CCUR) of all the hospitals catering to Covid-19 patients in Cebu City was still at 46 percent, which is considered a safe zone, she said.“The safe zone is 60 percent and below, which means we are still very much in the safe zone,” she added.As of Feb. 12, Cebu hospitals have allocated a total of 903 regular and ICU Covid beds.“We continue to call on our fellow Sugbuanons to do their share in this fight against the coronavirus,” she said.She said they have continued to strengthen the region’s testing capacity.The temporary treatment and monitoring facilities, and the private hospitals in the region are also willing to expand their Covid bed allocation, if necessary.

The vaccine will also improve space utilization back to 100 percent, which will lead to a spike in productivity/sales and reduce cost per square meter,” he said.Around 200 private firms have inked a deal with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the acquisition of its vaccine candidate against Covid-19.“Imagine the efficiency if people don’t have to line up due to social distancing. However, we can continue to wear face masks and constantly wash hands, as a new habit,” he said.Yu said the second quarter will also be steady and almost similar to the first quarter.“It will be uneventful but many exciting developments on the vaccine front is expected. There will be millions inoculated worldwide by this time. Nations will prepare to reopen travel and economy. School will still be virtual but the school year is about to end,” he said.Yu explained that people will start to feel the economic recovery by the third quarter. It is expected that growth will reach as high as eight to 10 percent.“The vaccines should reach Philippine shores. People and companies will scramble for the vaccines but in an orderly manner. In fact, as of this writing, the group of Joey Concepcion offered us vaccines minimum of 1,000 doses (AstraZeneca). Other details like costs are still not cascaded,” he said.In a report in November 2020, AstraZeneca said the vaccine showed an efficacy of 90 percent when it was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart.Efficacy was 62 percent when given as two full doses at least one month apart.The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent, the company added.Meanwhile, Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Felix Taguiam said safety protocols like the washing of hands and wearing of masks as well as social distancing will remain.

In Cebu City, Vice Mayor Michael Rama volunteered to be vaccinated first but not if the vaccine came from China. The Sinovac and Sinopharm vaccines are made by China while Sputnik is made by Russia.The Philippine government through vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez has been negotiating with various pharmaceutical manufacturers for our National Vaccination Program. According to the latest update, the US-Germany manufactured vaccine by Pfizer-BioNtech will arrive first in the middle of February before China’s Sinovac vaccine named CoronaVac. Well, whichever comes first at least we are already assured that we can start our vaccination program.But who’s afraid of China-made vaccines? Is it because China is known for counterfeit and fake products? Forgeries of luxury-brand products are more prevalent in China than in any other country in the world. But for products and materials which may involve lives like construction materials, China products have been known to be durable and have passed international standards.Did you know that some construction materials used by US engineers are made in China? Branded products made in China are of high quality and pass the company’s quality control. Their medical experts are not foolish to discover and manufacture substandard medicinal products, which may affect the lives of their own people and market these in other countries.Sinovac Biotech has sold more than 300 million doses to the developing world, filling a gap left by Western countries. In Brazil, officials said a coronavirus vaccine made by a Chinese company was effective, bolstering chances of approval for a second Chinese inoculation that could be rolled out in much of the developing world.Officials in the State of Sao Paulo, where a prominent medical research institute has been carrying out a study of the vaccine made by Beijing-based Sinovac, said the inoculation had an efficacy rate of 78 percent. However, a latest article in the South China Morning Post said, “Sinovac has been found to be significantly less effective than previous data had suggested, even as the Brazilian research institute that conducted the phase 3 clinical trials urges the public not to focus on the new efficacy rate.”The vaccine prevented all participants from developing serious and mild complications from the virus calling it a highly effective preventive tool. Sinovac has sold more than 300 million doses mostly to low- and middle-income countries, accounting for about half of the total doses that China says vaccine makers were capable of producing in 2020, based on an analysis of company statements and media reports.Just recently, Chinese companies signed agreements with at least 15 countries and regions, providing early access to doses. Their vaccines have been rolled out in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain after being approved for emergency use. Many of their early customers were governments that cooperated in the late stage, or Phase 3 trials. Brazil has roughly 10.8 million doses of the vaccine on hand and intends to start producing it locally, while Indonesia and Turkey have both received shipments of Sinovac vaccines. Sinovac has said it is able to produce 600 million doses this year.Health officials in these countries are not foolish enough to buy Sinovac if they found it less effective. There are several factors considered by our government officials why they chose the China-made vaccine over the other vaccines from Western countries like the US-Germany-made Pfizer-BioNtech and the Moderna vaccines. It’s not only the price but other considerations like the handling and storage of these vaccines. Other vaccines need ultra-freezers that are capable of storing products at minus 70 degrees Celsius. And we don’t have that kind of facility here. Even in the US they have a problem with storage.Other vaccines, like the one from AstraZeneca, which is manufactured by India-based Serum Institute, can be stored in a simple refrigerator and can be used anytime. So if we will venture into that, those vaccines that need to be stored in a specialized temperature might end up expired. We are just wasting our limited resources, and those vaccines will just be disposed of in the garbage like those expired medicines stored by the Department of Health and local government units.With this latest development, we can already be assured of our vaccination program. The only problem is to convince people to avail themselves of the vaccination program because of fear. Some still have “post-phobia” of the dengue vaccination because of the Dengvaxia controversy. Dr. Edsel Maurice Salvana, one of the county’s molecular biologists, urged the public, especially those vaccine skeptics, to stop attacking the vaccines. He said the vaccine confidence of Filipinos continues to plummet because of non-scientific and non-reviewed data circulating around.Dr. Salvana explained that vaccine efficacy is measured in many ways. Each vaccine will be judged on its ability to prevent infection, clinical disease and severe disease. So why not listen to the experts before we submit ourselves for vaccination?",sunstar

We, in Cebu, have enough quarantine and health care facilities to treat the novel coronavirus. There is a spike in cases but it is far from the peak that we experienced before,” he said.Yu said the challenge that remains vital is how to reopen the economy continuously and safely.“Economically, yes, we are deeply scarred. But from here, the optimism comes in, because we have tested the bottom,” Yu said.He said that achieving herd immunity through inoculation should be the ultimate goal, so the country can freely open the borders and drive consumption.Procurement progressVaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. on Jan. 11, 2021, said the national and local governments have signed agreements for the supply of over 30 million doses of candidate vaccines against Covid-19.Negotiations are ongoing for over 100 million doses more, he said.The target is to import a total of 148 million doses to inoculate 70 million citizens in 2021, Galvez told the Senate committee of the whole on Jan. 11.As of Jan. 11, Galvez said the confirmed supply agreements were those signed with AstraZeneca and Serum Institute of India, through its Philippine partner Faberco Life Sciences Inc.However, these will be available in the third quarter of 2021, at the earliest.Moreover, the government is also now in the final stages of negotiation with American biotechnology company Moderna for the procurement of up to 20 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccines.Eagerly waitingMeanwhile, Alfred Reyes, vice president of the Hotel, Resort and Restaurant Association of Cebu (HRRAC) said the tourism industry is eagerly waiting for the arrival of the vaccine.Reyes said the vaccine would spell immunity and with it comes the reopening of borders to allow entry of foreign tourists.“We hope we can bounce back by the third and fourth quarter of 2021. Once the people will again have the confidence, that’s the time people will start traveling again,” he said.Reyes said there is now hope since the vaccine has been discovered. It is just a matter of time that the vaccine will arrive in the Philippines. (JOB)",sunstar

Apan maglisod sila sa pagmatuod niini tungod kay gilubong na kini nga wa mapailawom sa autopsy.Ang mag- live-in partner nga sila Crisela Tuniacao ug Johnnel Abello nidala sa ilang anak sa Eversley Child Sanitarium aron pabakunahan.

Natakdan ang masuso apan naulian ra usa ka semana ang milabay.Sa ilang pag-uli sa balay, ang maguwang sa masuso adunay ubo hinungdan nga natakdan.Sa ilang pagpa-check up sa doktor, giresitahan kini og tambal bale og usa ka semana.Si Crisela nangutana sa pediatrician kon mamahimo na ba kining makapabakunahan tungod kay schedule na niini.Ang doktor niingon nga di kini makabakunahan samtang duna pay ubo. Human sa usa ka semana nga pagtambal, nag-follow-up check-up ang masuso .Kay normal na ang panglawas sa masuso, mamahimo na kining mabakunahan sa pagkasunod semana, sulti ni Crisela sumala sa tambag sa doktor.Miyerkules, Disyembre 4, sila niadto sa Eversely Child Sanitarium and General Hospital uban ang ilang masuso aron magpabakuna.BusySigon ni Crisela nga ang nurse nga nag-atiman nila busy og kupot sa iyang selpon.Gani, igo ra gitimbang ang ilang anak ug pagkahuman giturokan dayon sa mga vaccine nga wa gipahiran og alcohol ang paa sa masuso.

Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH), was the first to receive a dose of CoronaVac at around 9:30 a.m. Monday.Others who received the first of two doses of the Sinovac vaccine at the PGH were Dr. Edsel Salvana, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the UP-National Institutes of Health; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo; and Metro Manila Development Authority chairman Benhur Abalos Jr.Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19, underwent medical assessment prior to vaccination. He was later inoculated after the healthcare workers at the PGH.Health workers first
The National Government targets to administer the first dose of the Sinovac vaccine to all healthcare workers nationwide, who are willing to receive the vaccine, before the end of March, said Galvez.Aside from VSMMC, the vaccines will also be delivered to the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City on March 5 and 6.UP-PGH, a state-owned tertiary hospital, received 1,200 vials of the Sinovac vaccine, each containing a dose. Between 60 and 80 personnel had signed up for vaccination.At the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium, where 600 vials were delivered, testing czar Vince Dizon and medical center chief Alfonso Famaran Jr. kicked off the vaccinations.A total of 178 personnel had agreed to be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine.At the V. Luna Medical Center in Quezon City, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) held ceremonial inoculation for Dr. Fatima Claire Navarro, commanding officer of V. Luna Hospital, and two other doctors, Lt. Col. Cynthia Liao and Major Joel Lorenzo Rollo.In a statement, the AFP said it will also hold a ceremonial vaccination in primary healthcare facilities catering to Covid-19 patients in its major branches of service in the National Capital Region on March 2.At the Philippine Army General Hospital in Fort Bonifacio, its commanding officer, Dr. Joel Anastacio, led the ceremonial vaccination together with his team of medical frontliners.The Philippines received a donation of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine, the first batch of Covid-19 vaccines to reach the country, on Sunday, Feb. 28.The Sinovac vaccine is given in two doses four weeks apart to clinically healthy individuals who are 18 to 59 years old.In granting an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Sinovac vaccine, the FDA said it is not recommended for healthcare workers who deal directly with Covid-19 patients because of clinical trial results in Brazil that showed an efficacy of only 50.38 percent for this group.Efficacy
The vaccine, however, has been found to be 100 percent efficacious against severe Covid-19 and hospitalization, and 78 percent effective in preventing mild symptoms among individuals who are 18 to 59 years old.Despite the FDA recommendation, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Council (Nitag) had retained the prioritization framework and gave healthcare workers the right of first refusal to receive the vaccine.Nitag members stressed that vaccination is purely voluntary.Chan’s plan
The mayor of Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu, Junard “Ahong” Chan, said his office intends to buy CoronaVac, saying he wants a similar vaccine distributed by the National Government.He said he will allow himself to be inoculated in public with health officials to allay fears that vaccines are harmful.Chan said the city’s 1,400 health workers will be prioritized in the vaccination.Bright business outlook
Cebu’s business leaders said the arrival of the first doses of Covid-19 vaccines heralds economic recovery.Felix Taguiam, president of the Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the “arrival of the Sinovac vaccines brings relief, at least.”“I’m sure more will come in the following days. Any brand is better than no vaccine. Let’s get everyone to understand that being vaccinated is the only way we can all move forward,” he said.Steven Yu, president of the Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the business sector’s confidence was “greatly increased and boosted” as the government showed it can “deliver the vaccines.”The start of the vaccination, said Yu, also signals that the mobility and other restrictions might be removed soon once the country gets at least two million people vaccinated, as mentioned by President Rodrigo Duterte.“Lifting the restrictions can significantly increase economic activities and shorten economic recovery timeline. Livelihood for many people will be restored, and poverty levels will be greatly reduced,” he said.Boosting consumer confidence is the future effect of the vaccines’ arrival and rollout in the country, said Rey Calooy, chairman of the Filipino Cebuano Business Club.Calooy, however, tempers his outlook, saying: “We can only see the effects when we have fully vaccinated at least more than 50 percent of the intended number of population that we can vaccinate to get the economy running.” (MVI, KFD, JOB, GCM / SunStar Philippines)",sunstar

Mike insists there's still Sinulog.",,"January 14, 2021","P22M may yet be spentTO MANY people, Sinulog 2021 was totally canceled when the Regional IATF asked the mayor and national IATF to ban all physical and ""performance-based"" activities related to the cultural activity, a request that Sinulog Foundation Inc. and the steering committee acceded in what Vice Mayor Mike Rama, steering committee chief, called a ""prudent decision.""Without the ""ritual showdown"" at South Road Properties and the street dancing, not even for the purpose of video recording for a January 17 digital presentation, what parts of Sinulog were left?Apparently, Vice Mayor Mike Rama, SFI chairman and head of the steering committee, counts the online presentations they have done on the days leading to Sinulog day (in one of which Councilor Dondon Hontiveros was a judge).We still have the Sinulog, Mike Rama insisted in a privileged speech at the City Council Wednesday, January 13. To most people though, the Sinulog is the street dancing that culminates with the spectacular finale that used to be held at the Cebu City Sports Center and would've been held this year at SRP.If there were no more Sinulog, how could the P22 million (down from 2020's P40 million) be justified? ""Nakagasto na (we've already spent some of it),"" Rama said.Not to mention, but mentioned anyway, the Rama effort that had gone into the preparations. Mike said he already delivered 80 talks, including his January 13 Sanggunian speech, about the Sinulog, along with several planning sessions to come up with an ""unorthodox, unconventional and innovative"" celebration.To cap Mike Rama's non-physical Sinulog, there will be a Sinulog mass at Fort San Pedro Sunday, January 17. Will that count? Wait, won't that be a physical activity during a mass gathering of people?The dance contingents that have been disabled by the ban will get P150,000 per group and, maybe, another P150,000 in the middle of the year when the Philippine Christianization celebration starts. That P22 million may yet be spent.Coronavac? Bring it on, says EdCebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella is willing to be vaccinated with Coronavac manufactured by the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac, a January 13 story by John Rey Saavedra of the government-run Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.In contrast, Ed's vice mayor, Michael Rama, will submit to inoculation provided it is not Coronavac, the Sinovac product. The Cebu City Council presiding officer said at a press conference Monday (January 11) that the vaccine he'd take must also be approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The mayor trusts the vaccine that the Brazil results show is only 50.4 percent effective. ""far less effective than initially touted in that country.""The vice mayor does not.Thus, the city's two top officials present contrasting endorsements. City residents also get conflicting messages.What if Labella's pitch would draw less followers than Mike Rama's message, would that tell anything about their respective popular support? Of course not but the city's residents expectedly will choose the vaccine they trust, on the basis of information from trusted sources.Mayor Labella though already said city residents are given the right to choose the brand they prefer -- unlike presidential spokesman Harry Roque who implied that beggars cannot be choosers. As of now, though, there is no other brand except Sinovac's Coronavac that the national government has contracted for and is like to reach the city first.VM Rama won't get his vaccination yet. And his name, if the threat will push through, will go to the bottom of the list, along with other names of people who reject Coronavac.Preparations for vaccineLocal media extensively reported the budgeting of money to buy vaccines against Covid-19 because it was among the conditions of the vice mayor for the approval of the much-scrutinized 2021 appropriation ordinance.It was the only preparation that was publicized because the high officials talked just this week about the mayor forming a vaccine board given the task to lay the groundwork for the arrival of the drugs and its application when they come.They were long ready to buy but had trusted Manila to tell them how while other local governments competing for the vaccines were already negotiating with the suppliers. The January 11 list of LGUs that signed deals with AstraZeneca unsurprisingly did not include Cebu City; the city is not even in the list of those talking with the suppliers. The reason: it has left to Manila the matter of procuring the vaccines.Cebu City, a premier city, is literally behind other smaller cities on the aspect of securing the vaccines. City Hall, however, insists it is not trailing other LGUs. It has to prove that by a rollout of city-bought vaccines earlier than the other local governments, to which delivery has already been contracted.***Tell us about it.[paseares1@gmail.com]",sunstar

But they were told there is no fixed date yet on when the vaccine will actually get here, she said.Loreche said they are still trying to determine how many medical workers who are 60 years old and above will get the AZ vaccine.On Monday, the DOH 7 reported that 1,397 medical workers from the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) in Cebu City had been vaccinated with CoronaVac, the vaccine manufactured by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd., since Thursday, March 4.Of this number, 42 individuals experienced adverse effects, including dizziness, fatigue, lightheadedness, increase in blood pressure, headache, fainting and pain or numbness at the injection site.There were no reports of moderate or severe adverse effects that required hospitalization, Loreche said.The VSMMC received 7,200 doses of CoronaVac on Tuesday, March 2, the first batch of vaccines donated by the Chinese government to reach the Visayas.Loreche said if there are extra doses, these will be distributed to other DOH-manned hospitals, such as the Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital, the St. Anthony Mother and Child Hospital and the Talisay District Hospital.She said a total of 2,212 VSMMC personnel have agreed to be inoculated with CoronaVac.Loreche said they will soon distribute an additional 7,480 doses of CoronaVac to Levels 1, 2 and 3 public and private hospitals in Cebu.Of the 27,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine that Central Visayas is expected to receive, 14,680 doses have already been delivered to the DOH 7, she said.A second shipment of AZ vaccines arrived on Sunday, March 7, completing the first tranche of donations from the Covax facility.Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, received the shipment of 38,400 additional doses.These were transported by KLM Asia three days after the first shipment of 487,200 doses arrived.A total of 525,600 doses of AZ vaccine have now been delivered to the Philippines from Covax, the global initiative to ensure vaccine equity.To date, a total of 54,500 AZ doses have been deployed across the country.Of this number 1,500 doses have been sent to hospitals in the National Capital Region; 13,000 to Calabarzon; 10,000 to Cordillera Administrative Region; and 20,000 to Central Luzon.Galvez said the government aims to deploy an additional 240,720 doses to other regions this week.“Hopefully, yung Covax facility ay magdagdag ulit ng second tranche ng AstraZeneca. So ang expected natin ngayong May, pipilitin po natin matapos ‘yung lahat ng ating ospital. And then by April, magsisimula na tayo sa (vaccination ng) ibang mga sektor,” Galvez said.(Hopefully, the Covax facility will send an additional shipment of AZ vaccine. We hope to finish vaccinating all hospital personnel in the country by the end of May. And then by April, we start vaccinating other sectors.)He thanked the World Health Organization; Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund for the donation.The government has also deployed 317,350 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine for health care workers in hospitals and health care facilities in Culion, Palawan; Bontoc, Mountain Province; Marinduque; Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao; and Basilan.

Let’s put into our minds that even if we are vaccinated, we still need to observe minimum health standards,” he said.Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Steven Yu said with the arrival of the vaccines, the business community is given a renewed hope and strong confidence to hold on to their businesses and stay open in anticipation of better consumer spending.“Once we start opening up, that’s the time when consumer spending will start to increase, and in effect, more businesses will open too. Once healthcare workers are inoculated, hospital manpower will be strengthened and it will increase the capacity of the healthcare system,” he said.Yu added the vaccine rollout will then prompt the government to lift restrictions, which will eventually boost consumer spending.“Consumer spending is related to lifting restrictions and reducing fear of going out, and vaccination is the answer to that,” he said.But he emphasized that the economic recovery will depend on the speed of the vaccine rollout.“Once we hit two million vaccinated individuals, there will be an improvement in consumer spending and economic activities. It will gradually increase depending on the speed of vaccination,” he said.Filipino Cebuano Business Club chairman Rey Calooy said the vaccination program is being closely looked at by the business sector.He said companies, including those that temporarily stopped operating to weather the pandemic, are relying on the vaccine on their next business move.

Reports said that some LGUs are directly negotiating and, in fact, have already signed contracts with various vaccine manufacturers abroad. In Cebu City, detractors of Mayor Edgardo Labella lambasted him on social media for not acting with dispatch for the immediate purchase of the vaccines. They again criticized the mayor for his “inaction,” and that we have been overtaken by the LGUs of Bacolod, Iloilo and Ormoc.The mayor created a Vaccine Board to study every angle of the purchase. The board is expected to come up with recommendations. The mayor said he will just “take a cue from the national government.” The City Council appropriated P400 million for vaccine purchase, but it can pass a supplemental budget in case of a shortage. The national government, through vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, assured Labella that Cebu City is included in the priority list for the vaccination program considering that we are a highly urbanized city and had posted high positive cases in the past.Gov. Gwen Garcia is not so keen on the move to purchase vaccines for the Province’s constituents. In fact, the Provincial Board has not yet appropriated funds for the purpose. “Why in a hurry? This is not a race,” the governor was quoted as saying. Like Labella, Garcia will just take the cue from the national government.I agree with Gwen. While it is true that time is of the essence and that we need to be vaccinated as early as possible, but the hands of our LGUs are tied by policies of the national government. LGUs are under the mercy of the national government, which is the main procurer. This is not a case of buying a vinegar in a sari-sari store. Our LGUs have to be prudent in their move so as not to waste taxpayers’ money. The LGUs’ purchase is just to augment and complement the procurement made by the national government since not all LGUs can avail themselves of the free vaccination program.In a recent joint statement, it said: ‘The Department of Health (DOH), the National Task Force Against Covid-19 (NTF) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) appreciate the Covid-19 vaccine initiatives of LGUs. However, as mentioned by vaccine czar Galvez, LGUs cannot procure and roll out Covid-19 vaccines on their own. This must be coordinated with the national government through the NTF and DOH in a tripartite agreement involving local governments and pharmaceutical companies. This is meant to align the efforts of LGUs with the vaccine initiative of the national government, which integrates and consolidates all resources and initiatives.”“The FDA also clarifies that the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued by the government does not cover the commercial use of the vaccines. This means that manufacturers cannot sell directly to the LGUs or to any entity, unless they are under the vaccine initiative of the national government. Further, the DOH recognizes the equity issues raised on the distribution of the vaccine. We assured the public that the national government adheres to the principle of equity where delivery of services are biased towards the vulnerable and the disadvantaged.”So, you see, the LGUs cannot act alone. The President reminded the LGUs that the Covid-19 vaccine that they have chosen to procure should already be approved for use by the government. He said he would not interfere should LGUs get vaccines different from what the national government procured, although he clarified that no vaccine was better than the other.The chief executive explained that all medicines, including vaccines, should undergo government screening to ensure that they would be safe for consumption. “I am addressing the mayors and governors. You can choose any vaccine you like to buy. We don’t care what you choose. That’s one thing. We won’t meddle in the purchase. But you know that we have a law that says all medicines of whatever nature and whatever characteristics would have to go through the scrutiny of the government,” the chief executive said.Galvez also explained that the national government’s tripartite agreement with LGUs and vaccine manufacturers will maximize the manpower, expertise and resources to ensure a coordinated, integrated and holistic Covid-19 immunization program.So, to all those who are eager to be vaccinated, just sit back and relax. We will be there soon. But even if we have already the vaccine, we still have a problem on how to convince those skeptics to avail themselves of the program. There are so many Doubting Thomases out there, especially the vaccine made in China. According to a recent survey, there are nearly 50 percent who are unwilling to get inoculated for Covid-19 mainly due to concerns about the safety of the vaccine. In Norway, 23 people, mostly elderly with pre-existing diseases, died after being vaccinated by a US-made vaccine.",sunstar
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1877369/Cebu/Opinion/Mailiong-Vaccine,Mailiong: Vaccine,FRANK MALILONG,"November 19, 2020","After a dark summer when Cebu City oftentimes logged new cases in the hundreds every day, the Covid-19 situation eased up significantly during the last three months. The second week of November rudely jolted us, however, to the reality that what we enjoy is a temporary reprieve, that until such time that a vaccine is available, we remain vulnerable to the coronavirus.It’s not just us, if that offers any consolation. The whole world continues to suffer from the plague. The Johns Hopkins Covid-19 dashboard reported 56,178,674 cases yesterday from 191 countries and regions all over the world. A total of 1,348,348 people already died.The Philippines is number 26 in the same list with 412,097 cases. Our number of deaths is, however, lower than many countries that had lesser Covid-19 incidence. Among the smaller and less progressive Asian countries, we rank third behind Indonesia (478,720) and Bangladesh (438,795).These numbers are nothing compared to that of the United States which has 11,525,149 cases with 250,483 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. The US has been averaging over 150,000 cases daily since after their elections. The number of deaths has also been piling up at 1,900 daily, according to the New York Times.The lack of a national policy on how to control the spread of the virus is blamed for the runaway growth. States were left to decide what measures to implement and many of them came out with wearing of masks and physical distancing mandates only lately.In that regard, we are luckier than the Americans. Critics blame our government for acting late but at least when it did, the measures were strict, even draconian in the eyes of many. The quarantine is effective even if we still average about 2,000 new cases daily. If we want proof of how the quarantine has kept Covid-19 at bay, we don’t have to look far. Our experience is a model, according to the anti-Covid campaign czar in the Visayas, Roy Cimatu.Which is why people are wrong in criticizing Mayor Edgar Labella for immediately ordering strict border controls when the coronavirus showed signs of acting up. Labella showed that he was a decisive leader in doing that, according to a friend who is not exactly a Labella fan.These are interim measures, of course. Our safety from the dreaded disease still lies in the vaccine. And without meaning to ride on the misfortune of any people, what is happening to the US will ultimately benefit us. Their out-of-control pandemic is speeding the testing of vaccines, the NYTimes observed.Two companies have reported successful vaccine tests. Moderna and Pfizer said late stage trials show that their vaccines are 95 percent effective. It is doubtful though that both can roll out their vaccines within this year. And even if they do, it will take perhaps another six months before they are made available to us.Maybe, we can access other sources. Johnson & Johnson has included the Philippines in the list of countries where they will pick 30,000 who will be enrolled in their trial. And don’t forget Sputnik from Russia and the one that China has developed.Until then, let’s continue to obey the government’s strict, at times, draconian measures to keep us relatively safer from Covid-19.",sunstar

These are still for medical frontliners in both private and government health facilities, she said.“We have to understand nga dili g’yod tanan mahatagan karon (not everyone can be vaccinated now). We have to prioritize those working in Covid areas,” she said.Joseph Stephen Descallar, Philippine Nurses Association (PNA) 7 governor, said what is important is that the vaccine is approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).“The brand is just a secondary criterion, but safety is our utmost concern,” he said.He said the earlier the vaccination, the earlier herd immunity will be achieved, which will give way to the reopening of the economy and the return to normal activities.“The vaccination is not compulsory, but we encouraged our members to be vaccinated as long as there is a right to choose and the right to information,” he said.PNA Cebu has around 2,000 members.In a separate interview with the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas, Dr. Junjie Zuasula, head of DOH 7’s Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, said there is a need to “maximize” the supply of Covid-19 vaccines in the country.“Achieving herd immunity will take time. It will also depend on the supply of vaccines. But one thing is certain, we will achieve herd immunity in due time,” he said.Loreche appealed to the public to remain cautious even after they get vaccinated. She emphasized the need to observe minimum health measures, such as the wearing of face masks.“It doesn’t mean that if you get vaccinated, you no longer follow the minimum health protocols. This is our new normal already. Magpakabana gyud ta (We need to be careful),” she said.Earlier, Dr. Van Phillip Baton, DOH 7 medical program coordinator for infectious diseases, said the DOH 7 targets to vaccinate 5,634,789 individuals in the region this year.Meanwhile, Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella said he understands if some Cebuanos don’t want to be injected with the Sinovac vaccine.He said residents of Cebu City have the right to choose what brand of vaccine they want. That’s why the City Government is waiting for FDA approval before it can use the P400 million it has set aside to purchase the vaccine.“As I have said before, we will give them the opportunity to choose. They have the right to refuse and wait for another vaccine brand that the City will purchase,” he said in a mix of Cebuano and English.City Councilor Dave Tumulak, for his part, said he will be at the VSMMC on the first day of vaccination on March 4, adding that he will be among those who will be injected with the CoronaVac.Although the vaccines are intended for medical frontliners of the hospital, Tumulak said he saw the need to personally feel its effects so he can share the information with the public.In Mandaue City, the Vaccine Board has registered 1,616 medical workers out of the 2,000 priority target.These medical workers are from government-owned medical facilities, private clinics and private medical facilities, excluding private hospitals.Ernie Manatad, Vaccine Board chairman and president of the Association of Barangay Councils, said they will register local government unit frontliners and senior citizens next.Manatad clarified that individuals can refuse to be vaccinated but they cannot refuse to be registered.He said the Vaccine Board will start its information drive to make residents understand the importance of getting inoculated against Covid-19.

He said the City must set aside a budget for this as early as now.Labella said the CHD budget will also include the purchase of flu and pneumonia vaccines and other medicines needed in the fight against the novel coronavirus.For infrastructure, he said the City must set aside a budget for the completion of the Cebu City Medical Center, city roads, traffic improvement and other projects that will “spur economic development.”For education, Labella said the Department of Education is trying to come up with programs that will complement distance learning while face-to-face classes are prohibited.He said there is an ongoing pilot study for the use of laptops and tablets in Barangays Tisa and Carreta and a pilot study for the installation of Wi-Fi in Barangays Labangon and Tejero.The Department of Social Welfare and Services is also expected to get a large budget since it is charged with providing assistance to different sectors affected by the current health crisis.He said the budget will also include programs for the City’s economic recovery.Labella expects the deliberation to be completed within this week.Meanwhile, Labella assured that the City’s essential programs will not be compromised.“We will catch up.

They have to go out every day to conduct their businesses. If they are already vaccinated, the spread of local transmission can be stopped,” he said.Eight places in the country are currently under the more restrictive general community quarantine classification: the Cordillera Administrative Region, National Capital Region, Batangas, Tacloban City, Davao City, Davao del Norte, Lanao del Sur and Iligan City.

This raised again the question on the safety of these vaccines. Would people, regardless of age group, get the same vaccine doses? Or will older people get a different kind of vaccine?Twenty-three elderly patients died in Norway following their vaccination with the Pfizer-BionNtech mRNA vaccine against Covid-19. Following this, the Norwegian government launched a detailed investigation into the reported fatalities. More than 30,000 people have received the first shot of the Pfizer or Moderna Covid vaccines in the Scandinavian country since the end of December.Doctors in Norway have been asked to conduct a more thorough evaluation of every frail elderly patient in line for the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine following the reported deaths. But some experts say it may just be a coincidence. There is no established connection between these deaths and the vaccine. But whatever it is, the Norway cases have raised alarm on the possible end-users of these vaccines. Filipino senior citizens are skeptical over our forthcoming vaccination program for fear that what happened in Norway might happen to them.According to an article published by The Guardians written by Nicola David, “Concerns around the efficacy of the Oxford University/AstraZeneca coronavirus jab in older people could lead to different age groups being given different vaccines, expert have said. The Oxford/AstraZaneca announced that the vaccine had a 70 percent efficacy overall. For most trial participants given two full doses, spaced a month apart, efficacy was 62 percent, but for 3,000 participants mistakenly given half a dose for their first jab, the efficacy was 90 percent. No participant, regardless of dose, developed severe Covid or was hospitalized with the disease.Regulatory bodies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have previously said they would approve a vaccine that prevents Covid or reduces the diseases’ severity in at least 50 percent of vaccinated people. The Oxford/Astrazeneca results caused more excitement, with the 90 percent figure rivaling those vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer/BionNtech.However, it has emerged that the group that received the low dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine did not include any participant over the age of 55, meaning it is unclear whether the 90 percent efficacy holds for older adults who are at high risk from Covid. This has led the company to announce a new trial using the lower dose regimen until it was approved by regulatory bodies and being rolled out in UK and Europe.Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez said that in view of the Norway incident, the National Vaccination Program has changed strategy. They want to vaccinate only those aged 16 years old up to 65 years old. They will look for a vaccine that would be used for those 65 years old and above. Senior citizens were supposed to be in the priority list for the vaccination program, but in view of the Norway incident, they would be excluded in the list.But it is not a guarantee that you will not be infected with the disease once you get vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is recommending the following for people who get vaccinated against Covid-19, especially older adults: 1) Even after people get both doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, they must remain vigilant at protecting themselves from catching the virus and spreading it to others; 2) Everyone needs to continue social distancing, wear face masks and practice hand hygiene; 3) Older adults, who are at an increased risk for severe illness or death if they get Covid-19, should stay in close contact with their doctors and tell them about any changes in their health. After they get the Covid-19 vaccine jab, they should also let their doctor know about any side effects they experience.If this is the case, the more people will not submit themselves for vaccination.

BAJENTING,"March 04, 2021","MAJOR business chambers in Cebu are now working on securing vaccine doses against Covid-19 for their employees.Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Felix Taguiam said they participated in the vaccine procurement through the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Go Negosyo project of Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion.“The groups have already done four seminars with the big vaccine makers accepting pre-order status. Many companies have signed up and taken part in the reservation of the vaccines,” he said.He noted companies are still waiting for the actual delivery dates amid pending suppliers’ documentation and authorization.“All these companies that ordered the doses are for their employees’ use. With the arrival of Sinovac, we hope this will signal for other vaccines to come also. The sooner, the better,” he said.At least 7,200 Sinovac doses were transported to Cebu via a Philippine Airlines flight on Tuesday, March 2, 2021.Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) president Steven Yu said more than 100 companies have signed up for private initiatives to secure Covid-19 vaccines.“Aside from the big companies who joined the ‘A Dose Of Hope’ of Secretary Concepcion, the MCCI is probably one of the few lead business groups that partnered with International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICTSI) in procuring Moderna vaccines for its member and affiliate companies,” he said.While the MCCI has secured a firm allocation from ICTSI, ICTSI has yet to sign the tripartite agreement with Moderna in relation to the concerned allocation.“These are purely non-profit and corporate social responsibility endeavors of the MCCI. These are the updates as of this writing. ICTSI is firm on its commitment to help vaccinate the Philippine population, and help the country attain herd immunity. As they say, ‘No one is safe until everyone is safe,’” he said.Yu said they can’t reveal how many doses are in the process of being procured due to confidentiality agreements. But he noted that companies, big and small combined, are willing to procure at least 100,000 doses for their employees.Filipino Cebuano Business Club chairman Rey Calooy, on the other hand, said they will wait for the government to procure more vaccines.“We will stay posted for any advisories coming from the government because we know that the process must be authorized by them first,” he said.Voluntary, highly encouragedMeanwhile, the business leaders said it is up to the employees if they will participate in their company’s vaccination program.But they said it is highly encouraged.“It’s the employees’ decision. I would suggest that employees take the vaccines because companies are really investing in employee training and others,” Taguiam said.He said part of the process is to make sure that all are vaccinated to protect each other in the workplace so the economy can keep on going.Yu said they already informed their members that vaccination should be voluntary.“We, in MCCI, have informed our members that vaccination is voluntary, and minimum health protocols should still be followed. They are free and encouraged to do information awareness to their employees on the positive effects of the vaccine,” he said.Calooy also said vaccination remains voluntary and not mandatory, adding that it is up to the employees to weigh the pros and cons of having themselves vaccinated against Covid-19.",sunstar

We request for the timely provision of clear and transparent guidelines and trainings on vaccine-related procedures,” the statement further read.“Nurses are the biggest healthcare workforce against this pandemic. Our contribution to this global healthcare burden has been valuable and remarkable in so many ways,” the group said.The PNA-Cebu reiterated its appeal to government for the rational provision of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and the augmentation of basic salaries and benefits, especially for nurses working in private hospitals.“Nurses are also family members, friends and ultimately persons who equally need to be cared for. Let us show our care by fighting on the side of our nurses and other healthcare providers,” the group added.When Cebu’s daily reported Covid-19 cases rose to three-digit numbers last year, PNA-Cebu revealed that some local nurses had wanted to quit their jobs due to low pay coupled with fears of getting infected with the virus.Local government units like Cebu City then promised to assist nurses assigned in public and private hospitals through cash incentives.
Covid tests
Meanwhile, pooled tests using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique will be conducted on taxi drivers plying Cebu City streets beginning Tuesday, Feb. 16.Mayor Edgardo Labella said the RT-PCR tests aim to check if there are taxi drivers in Cebu City who are asymptomatic of the coronavirus disease.Labella, in a virtual press conference on Feb. 11, said drivers who refuse to be tested could have their operations temporarily hampered.There are an estimated 1,500 taxi drivers plying Cebu City.Labella said if there are drivers who test positive for Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, they will be sent to barangay isolation centers (BICs).Labella said drivers who can afford may also opt to stay in accredited hotels during their mandatory quarantine period.The Covid test for taxi drivers will be done in coordination with the Department of Health (DOH) Central Visayas, GoNegosyo, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC), and UC-Med.

On Nov. 9, 2020, vaccine developer Pfizer Inc. announced it could have 50 million doses available globally by the end of 2020, enough for 25 million.“A game changer” and “a ray of hope,” Philippine officials were quick to respond.Mary Jean Loreche, Department of Health (DOH) 7 spokesperson, said Pfizer’s pronouncement offers a ray of hope that the pandemic would soon be contained. “We only need around 60 to 70 percent of effectivity to tell if it achieves its role. For the 90 percent effectivity, that is good if it’s true,” she said.Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said, “The availability of the vaccine will be a game changer, where we go from avoidance to actively minimizing the threat of infection.”What can easily get lost in the excitement is that the vaccine developers are also currently facing a challenge more prosaic than just making the vaccine safe. The problem of efficient transport of the vaccine is still something to be solved.A recent study by courier companies found that the vaccine, which requires stringent temperature controls, may only be accessible to about 2.5 billion people in 25 countries.Pfizer had customized transport containers for the boxes that can carry 10 to 20 doses of the vaccine and are embedded with GPS-enabled thermal sensors so their locations and temperature can be easily tracked. As they come in glass vials, the risk of breakage under extreme temperature is most likely. As of now, manufacturers are developing glass vials that can survive under negative 80 degrees Celsius.Which brings us to the state of logistical capabilities the Philippines’ healthcare system has. Do we have enough cold storage facilities to store volumes of the vaccine supply?Research firm Center for Strategic and International Studies pointed out the complexities of the delivery side of the vaccine, the demand for strict temperature control might render many developing countries in the world incapable of receiving sufficient vaccine supply.As of the moment, Roque revealed that the Philippines only has one facility that is capable of bulk cold storage, which is the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in Muntinlupa. Government may have to build more storage facilities.DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said government prefers that each region or province will have its own cold storage facility.While Pfizer, likely forerunner in the vaccine race, will be deploying supplies by early next year, transport and recipient storage are another story altogether.",sunstar

This planet is full of weirdos.Last Sunday in Los Angeles, California, around 50 demonstrators blocked the entrance to the Dodgers Stadium for about an hour even as a long column of motorists waited outside to have themselves vaccinated. The protesters did not believe in the vaccine, dismissing it as another scam, which, it must be stressed, is within their right to do. But the idea of the minority imposing their belief on the many is simply ridiculous.I do not think that this behavior will show its face here, notwithstanding the skepticism by some towards the pandemic and consequently towards the vaccine. In the first place, I do not think our authorities will be as tolerant as their American counterparts who let the LA protesters go and did not file any charges. Our policemen will only be too willing to haul off to jail anyone who causes a similar disruption.Which reminds me, how soon can we start vaccination in Cebu? Sooner than earlier planned, I hope. The current surge in coronavirus infections should prod our officials to readjust their timetable to an earlier date.As a matter of fact, our officials should already have a plan on the mechanics of the rollout this early. Compared to the other vaccines, the one for Covid is said to be more perishable. Do we already have a plan where to store them and how quickly we can inject them to the people?And who are the people who will get the vaccine in Cebu City, for example? Should they be limited to the city residents only? What about those who reside outside but work in the city? Shouldn’t they be the concern of the city government, too?If the first batch of vaccines is not enough for every Cebu City resident, who will enjoy priority? We are not known to patiently wait for our turn. If we do not have a plan now, there will be confusion. Other countries, including the US, went through that. Let’s learn from their experience.",sunstar
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1883742/Cebu/Opinion/Editorial-Securing-vaccine-equity,Editorial: Securing vaccine equity,,"January 24, 2021","NOBODY is left behind. This is equity in plain terms.Upholding the principle of equity is a challenge for society, more so equity in immunization, particularly to inoculate people against infection of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).Yet, vaccine equity should remain a priority for governments, particularly the Philippines where deep social disparities create in the population large swathes of vulnerable citizens.Reducing the vaccine inequity begins by identifying and addressing its root causes, advocates the World Health Organization.Equity should be prioritized along with efficiency in the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccines in the country.The Philippines has a total population of approximately 108 million, 70 million of whom are targeted for vaccination by the government.This is according to Department of Health (DOH) 7 Director Jaime Bernadas, as reported on Jan. 20, 2021 by Wenilyn B. Sabalo and Philip A. Cerojano in “SunStar Cebu.”Bernadas said the government aims to vaccinate 35.1 million Filipinos in 2021. The prioritized include “senior citizens, indigents, frontliners, and government employees.”The rest of the 70 million will be vaccinated by the government in 2022. By 2023, all Filipinos should be inoculated, said Bernadas.To prepare for the rollout, the DOH 7 began briefing its personnel and employees of local government units (LGUs), with the LGUs expected to “cascade” the information to the communities.Bernadas said the DOH has scheduled briefings with private medical practitioners next week. This leveling-off of information about the vaccines among the stakeholders is expected to avoid spreading contradicting, conflicting information, he said.The DOH’s preference for a “trickle-down” program of information, education and communication (IEC) is centralized, time-consuming and not guaranteed against misinformation and misperception, particularly in untangling the deep-set biases of many Filipinos against free government vaccines, following the Dengvaxia controversy in November 2017.Fears and suspicions stirred up by conflicting health claims in media lingered and turned many parents against the government’s immunization campaigns even a year later, with only about 50 to 60 percent of Filipino children covered in vaccination programs compared to pre-Dengvaxia coverage of 90 percent, said DOH Undersecretary Enrique Domingo in September 2018, according to a Rappler report on Sept. 27, 2018.Getting the trust back of the people in a vaccine, primarily its safety and efficacy, is crucial for vaccination to take place.Regaining public trust will hardly result from a centralized IEC strategy, as gauged from low immunization rates following the 2018 DOH “Ligtas Tigdas” supplemental immunization activities and the school- and community-based immunization programs following the Dengvaxia scare.Parents refused to give their consent for their children to participate in school immunizations. When health workers went house-to-house for vaccination, mothers hid their children. In Metro Manila, health workers spent as long as 30 minutes to try to convince parents to let their children be vaccinated, said DOH National Immunization Program Manager Maria Silva to Rappler in 2018.The DOH, LGUs, and other public and private stakeholders should refocus their IEC campaigns on the Covid-19 vaccines in the communities, tapping influencers and the trimedia and social media, if applicable.Citizens have questions about the safety and the efficacy of the vaccines, given the varying manufacturers and storage requirements.For raising public confidence in the Covid-19 vaccines, particularly against the new strains, the public participation of key public figures, such as President Rodrigo Duterte, may counter citizens’ anxieties and contribute to achieving the vaccine equity that will be the key out of this pandemic.",sunstar
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1885287/Cebu/Opinion/Cabaero-Vaccine-jab-on-FB-Live-or-TV,Cabaero: Vaccine jab on FB Live or TV,NINI CABAERO,"February 08, 2021","THE common response to a recent survey on whether they would take the vaccine against Covid-19 was that of wait and see–wait for what will happen before we decide, or let others be first then we will see.Well, the list of people wanting to go first to help boost confidence in the vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is growing longer. And they’re willing to do it in public. Perhaps à la influencer on social media for better impact and wider reach.The government’s vaccination program is working on a priority list based on World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. At the top of the list are medical frontliners who have to be strong enough to care for the sick, followed by the elderly, indigent and law enforcers.To try to convince majority of Filipinos to have themselves vaccinated, there are local government officials and Church leaders and members who are offering themselves to be among the first to get inoculated in order to show others that the vaccine is safe.Church leaders and priests are among those joining the line to have a jab, and there’s the suggestion that they do it in public or on television so more people can watch.Take the case of Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, a Filipino Dominican priest and molecular biologist, who said in mid-January that once the vaccine will be available and he is eligible, he will avail himself of it. He will also have his elderly mother get vaccinated if possible. Austriaco then suggested that local officials and priests have themselves vaccinated on television. Not a bad idea for influencers and leaders to have it on Facebook Live or on television.Pope Francis and Pope emeritus Benedict XVI have both received their second and final dose of the vaccine. Church sites in Manila and a Catholic school in Davao are being offered as vaccination sites. These are examples of how the Church is doing its part in the effort to allay fears.Austriaco became emotional when he said he hoped people will allow themselves to be inoculated because the vaccine is there to help them. He said side effects are normal for some people and the few who died could have been because of their other medical conditions.For those who do not want the vaccine, the message is this: If you do not want to get vaccinated, think of the people around you who can be infected if you have the virus. To protect them, get the vaccine so you do not spread the virus.I’m not a social media influencer, but I would like to have my vaccine as soon as possible, or as I become eligible, to protect myself and others.* * * Read the four-part special report by Marites V.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1888315/Cebu/Local-News/AstraZeneca-vaccine-set-to-arrive-in-Central-Visayas,AstraZeneca vaccine set to arrive in Central Visayas,,"March 09, 2021","AROUND 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine against Covid-19 are set to arrive in Central Visayas on Wednesday, March 10, 2021.This was confirmed by Department of Health 7 spokesperson Dr. Mary Jean Loreche during a Project Balik Buhay (PBB) briefing on Tuesday, March 9, the sixth day of the vaccination rollout in the region.The Philippines is the 16th country worldwide and the third Asean member-nation to receive vaccines from the Covax facility within the first few days of its global rollout.The vaccines, donated by the Covax facility, were transported by Unicef via a commercial flight of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines earlier this week.The AstraZeneca vaccines will be stored in the DOH 7 cold chain storage.Loreche said they are still in the planning stage for the distribution, but she said the DOH 7 emphasized that healthcare workers (HCWs) in their 60s and above will get the vaccine jabs first and the excess will be rolled out to other HCWs ages 18 to 59.CoronaVac jabs
Some private hospitals in Cebu have started vaccinating their healthcare workers with CoronaVac, a vaccine developed by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech Ltd., that was provided by the National Government.The first private hospital in Cebu to vaccinate its frontline workers was the Cebu City branch of Chong Hua Hospital (CHH) on Monday, March 8.CHH was allocated more than 3,500 doses of CoronaVac by the DOH 7, and the hospital already started its initial rollout on Monday with 160 frontliners vaccinated. The vaccination of frontliners continued on Tuesday, March 9.On Tuesday, March 9, other private hospitals, Perpetual Succour Hospital and Cebu Doctors’ University-Hospital (CDUH), also inoculated medical frontliners and other vital staff members from their administration, maintenance and security.Loreche said CHH Cebu City has an allocation of 2,468 CoronaVac doses; CHH Mandaue City, 1,111; CDUH or CebuDoc, 1,585; Cebu South General Hospital (SouthGen), 414; Cebu North General Hospital (NorthGen), 364; and Mactan Doctors’ Hospital (MactanDoc), 560. CebuDoc, MactanDoc, NorthGen and SouthGen are part of the CebuDoc Group.Around 70 percent of the CHH staff, including doctors, nurses, maintenance, security and other support staff, agreed to be vaccinated with CoronaVac. As of 3:30 p.m., 245 CebuDoc Group health workers had been vaccinated and only two experienced adverse effects.Positive response
Dr. Faith Villanueva, an infectious disease specialist and head of CHH’s head of Covid-19 vaccination task group, described the turnout as a positive response and a boost of confidence to the country’s ongoing nationwide vaccination program.CebuDoc Group also started its vaccination program against Covid-19 on its healthcare workers on Tuesday, with a ceremonial vaccination held at the CebuDoc Group Vaccination Center located at the parking area of Medical Arts Building 1.Dr. Potenciano “Yong” Larrazabal III, president and chairman of the board, received the first dose of CoronaVac to kick off the vaccination rollout in CebuDoc Group and to boost the confidence of CebuDoc Group Healthcare workers in the vaccine.“Vaccination is the way to go if we want to attain herd immunity,” he said in a press statement, adding, “I believe the best vaccine is the first vaccine on hand.”The Covid-19 vaccine recipients will be given two doses. They will also undergo a six-step process—registration, orientation, assessment, actual vaccination, post-vaccination monitoring, and post-vaccination documentation.For the first batch, 1,460 out of the nearly 3,000 healthcare workers of CebuDoc Group are expected to get vaccinated from March 9 to 12, 2021. They will receive the second dose after a month.“This is just the beginning. Once all our frontliners are already inoculated, we also hope to roll out our supplementary vaccination for our family members. We will also be extending assistance to the different LGUs (local government units) in Cebu for the vaccination of the Cebuanos,” Larrazabal said.Sinovac’s CoronaVac is the third Covid-19 vaccine brand to be approved for emergency use after Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.Larrazabal said they are ready for future mass vaccination programs.“We have systems in place. Our team is ready to do the mass vaccination once the LGUs and other sectors start tapping us to administer their vaccination,” he said.At Perpetual Succour Hospital (PSH) in Cebu City, 120 of its employees—doctors (70 percent), and nurses, allied health professionals and security personnel (30 percent)—were inoculated with CoronaVac during its rollout of the vaccination Tuesday.The CoronaVac will be administered to health workers who are 18 years old up to 59 years old; however, PSH will allow health workers above 60 years old to be vaccinated as long as they sign a waiver, said Dr. Elrey Inocian, head of the PSH vaccination team.On Tuesday, PSH medical professionals Dr. Fe Marie Perez, 62, and her husband Dr. Monico Perez, 63, were vaccinated with CoronaVac.Monico said they have friends in Hong Kong who were vaccinated with CoronaVac who told them that there is no age qualification to get the vaccine.Monico and his wife decided to get inoculated because it is better to feel the adverse effects than to get infected with Covid-19.Dr. Ian Teodorico, an allergy specialist and head of the post-vaccination and monitoring team of PSH, was one of the doctors vaccinated at Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC).Teodorico has a history of allergic rhinitis, severe atopic and allergic reactions to crabs. Despite his condition, he did not feel any adverse effects after he was vaccinated.He said being allergic to food or medicine is not a contraindication against the vaccine as it has different components. So, he said, there is no need to be afraid of getting vaccinated since there is a specialist who will monitor the recipient’s condition.After the vaccination, the recipient will have to be monitored on-site for 30 minutes to an hour, then they are advised to go home and rest.Teodorico said they will continue to monitor the condition of the recipients for the next four hours for any adverse effects.He said the adverse effects will only last one to three days, and the easy remedy includes taking paracetamol and other pain relievers.More than 50 percent of PSH health workers, or nearly 600 out of 1,107 employees, agreed to be inoculated. The hospital’s first vaccination rollout will end on Sunday, March 14.The rest of the PSH medical workers who chose not to get CoronaVac jabs said they will wait for the other vaccine brands to arrive, said Inocian.Recipients
Loreche said 12 private and public hospitals in Central Visayas already received the CoronaVac doses allocated for them, while 28 medical institutions are set to receive their vaccines.As of March 9, a total of 1,904 VSMMC health workers had been vaccinated. Of the number, 52 experienced adverse effects.Some of the adverse effects felt by the vaccine recipients were lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling tired, numbness at the injection site, itching, hypertension, headache and fainting.In Bohol, a total of 277 medical workers at Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital have been vaccinated since March 5.Also on Tuesday, the vaccination at Lapu-Lapu City Hospital started, and the first recipient was its administrator, Dr. Ronald Oporto. Mayor Junard Chan attended the event, but he was not inoculated as the medical frontliners are prioritized to receive the CoronaVac jabs.Oporto said 102 hospital personnel will be vaccinated in the next three days.Teachers encouraged
At the Department of Education in Cebu, Dr. Marilyn Andales, Cebu Province Schools Division superintendent, urged her fellow teachers to get inoculated if it is already time for their vaccination.There were teachers who agreed to get the vaccine.However, Andales said there were teachers who feared the Covid-19 vaccine would cause them to fall ill, while others said they would choose not to receive the vaccine because they have pre-existing illnesses.

If the need for an additional budget arises for the vaccine acquisition, a supplemental budget must be passed, Labella said.The first-term local executive believes the confidence level of the business community and the public will go up if a vaccine is already available in the city and a targeted demographic is already inoculated.“I hope the vaccine will be made available so everything will go back to normal,” Labella said.Hopeful, vigilantFor the business community, remaining hopeful and vigilant go hand in hand as enterprises greet the new year with subdued fervor.Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI) president Felix Taguiam said 2020 was a challenging year for everyone.“Let’s start 2021 with a ray of hope and a Covid-free environment. We all have to start rebuilding what we lost and we have to rebuild consumer confidence and spending to alleviate (the plight of) our micro, small and medium enterprises, which is the backbone of our economy,” he said.Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Steven Yu said they expect the year 2021 to start with a steady first quarter as nations figure out the new virus strain, which he saw as a “minor hiccup” as “vaccines will still cover its implications.”“For Cebu, the Sinulog festivities, hybrid they may be, will still usher in the mood for celebration among the Cebuanos. With a P25 million budget, it is expected to stage a good overall presentation and package. The Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day celebrations will be muted and celebrated sparsely,” he said.Entrepreneurs, said Filipino-Cebuano Business Club chairman Rey Calooy, “must not be afraid of the unknown.”He further said: “We are all adventurers in the year ahead, and we seldom fear any hardship or difficulties.”Labella’s other targetsAt the Cebu City Hall, several projects for 2020 were not realized as they took a backseat because of the pandemic; one of these was the proposed establishment of the Cebu City College (CCC).Labella vowed to work for the realization of CCC this year.The proposed ordinance for the creation of CCC, authored by City Councilor Raymond Alvin Garcia, has been sitting in the City Council for almost a year now.The City Council made some modifications as there was already an approved ordinance in 2012 for the creation of a city college. The legislation was authored by City Councilor Joy Augustus Young.The CCC, once finalized, will offer four-year programs on solid waste management, flood control, traffic systems, environmental management, water systems, nutrition science, hospital administration and nursing.It will also offer two-year programs on caregiving, welding, the hotel and service industry, sustainable farming and robotics.New CCMC buildingTo address public health concerns, Labella said more departments of the Cebu City Medical Center (CCMC) are set to be opened in 2021.Despite the Covid-19 pandemic, Labella said he was glad that the new CCMC building was able to partially open and operate its outpatient department on Dec. 28, 2020.Labella said more departments will be opened.These are the emergency department and the imaging department that conducts digital x-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); delivery and operating rooms; and a few wards.Labella said the imaging department will be opened next to the outpatient department so Cebu City residents do not need to go to other clinics and hospitals.Improving tax collectionFor this year, Labella said a tax mapping has to be made as it can help correct the tax collection of the City.Labella said there were some establishments that had been registered as residential units, but they were later converted into condominiums. He said these properties must be traced for proper tax collection.“There is no need to increase the tax payment. We only need to have proper tax collection,” he said.Helping business sectorLabella said the drivers of the City’s economy, the business community, will also be focused on.He hoped that in 2021, the business concierge, which is in partnership with CCCI, will be in full operation.The Cebu Investment Development Concierge Center is a one-stop trade and investment center for businesses and investors interested in locating and investing in the City and Province of Cebu and is a flagship Public-PrivatePartnershipLabella said both the City and CCCI had started to develop and disseminate information on it to the foreign investors. But the project was paused because of the pandemic.Cebu City, being the business hub and gateway in Central Visayas, has to bring its investment climate back to normal again, Labella said.Maintaining servicesDespite the pandemic, Labella was glad that the City was still able to implement and maintain some of its services.The pandemic, he said, made the City Government innovative like how it did with the financial assistance distribution for the persons with disability (PWDs) and senior citizens.The City opted to distribute the cash aid to the houses of the beneficiaries, and it is now on its way to using cash cards.The City also implemented radio-based learning to answer the concern of some parents who are having a hard time teaching their children in distance learning.The other programs and projects the City was able to implement in 2020 include the maintenance of parks and playgrounds and comprehensive garbage collection; brightened lamp posts with the use of LED lights and repair on damaged roads; construction of school buildings and medium-rise buildings, and conduct of river cleanup activities.Labella’s hopeFor 2021, Labella hoped that the city will be able to maintain its community quarantine status and its inclusion in areas considered as low risk.Cebu City is under modified general community quarantine until the end of January. / WITH JOB",sunstar

Delivery of the vaccine, however, has been delayed.On the other hand, Domingo said ongoing clinical trials in Indonesia and Turkey, which involve clinically healthy individuals 18 to 59 years old, have yielded efficacy rates of 65.3 percent and 91.2 percent, respectively. Indonesia has also certified the Sinovac vaccine as halal.SafetyDomingo said ""it is reasonable to believe that the Sars-CoV-2 vaccine (Vero Cell), inactivated (CoronaVac), may be effective"" in preventing Covid-19.""The benefits of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risks,"" he added. The vaccine will be administered in two doses, 0.5 ml each, given four weeks apart.Adverse reactions to the Sinovac vaccine were transient, and mostly mild to moderate, similar to common vaccine reactions, Domingo said.""No specific safety concerns were specified, but it must be noted that this only reflects limited follow-up and more adverse effects will emerge, that's why close surveillance and monitoring is needed after the immunization,"" he added.Domingo also said the Sinovac vaccine is a good option for individuals who have allergies to components of other available vaccines. The World Health Organization earlier advised against giving the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to individuals with a history of anaphylaxis to polyethylene glycol (PEG).The government is expecting delivery of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine on February 23.The shipment includes 100,000 doses that were donated by the Chinese government to the Department of National Defense (DND).Sinovac is the third vaccine developer to get an EUA in the Philippines, after Pfizer and AstraZeneca on January 14 and 28, respectively.Other vaccinesThe Philippines has been allotted 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine by Covax, the WHO initiative to ensure global equitable access to vaccines. This will be administered to healthcare workers from 32 facilities in Metro Manila, Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City.Covax has also committed up to 9.29 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Philippines in the first half of 2021.Read: Covax allots 9.4M doses of Pfizer, AstraZeneca vaccines for PHApplications for EUA that are still pending in the Philippines are those from Gamaleya and Bharat Biotech.Domingo said Gamaleya submitted the requirements on Friday, February 19. Bharat, on the other hand, has not submitted its clinical trials data.The EUA, effective only for the duration of the public health emergency, is not a marketing authorization nor a certificate of product registration. It can't be sold commercially, Domingo stressed.Sinovac's local partner, IP Biotech, can only sell the vaccine to the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against Covid 19 or their local partners in the immunization program.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1887844/Cebu/Local-News/First-vaccinations,More VSMMC healthcare workers say yes to Sinovac,WENILYN SABALO,"March 04, 2021","THOUGH hesitant at first, the number of healthcare workers (HCWs) at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) in Cebu City who consented to be inoculated with Sinovac’s CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine has increased as of Wednesday, March 3, 2021.VSMMC chief Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr. said 1,246 HCWs of the hospital have already agreed to be vaccinated.Aquino, 56, was the first to get the Sinovac vaccine during a ceremony for the first vaccine rollout in the Visayas and Mindanao held inside the new Center for Behavioral Sciences building of the VSMMC at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 4.After Aquino, Dr. Juanito Tiu of St. Anthony Mother and Child Hospital, Dr. Pythagoras Zerna of Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital, Ret. Maj. Gen. Melquiades Feliciano of the Inter-Agency Task Force Central Visayas, and Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, Department of Health (DOH) 7 spokesperson and chief pathologist, also received Sinovac’s vaccine.Cebu City Vice Mayor Michael Rama, Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes, Lapu-Lapu City Mayor Junard Chan and Chinese Consulate-General Jia Li were present to witness the inoculations.“There was just a little pain on the injection, just like the ordinary vaccination. Other than that, they kept on monitoring my vital signs and BP (blood pressure) and it was okay,” Aquino said during the post- vaccination briefing.Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo of the Field Implementation and Coordination Team administered the vaccine on Aquino.For her part, Loreche said now that they have “shown the way,” they expected fellow healthcare workers, frontliners and Cebuanos to see that the Sinovac vaccine is really safe.“We believe that we have to have the vaccine as it is now because this the best vaccine that we have at this moment,” Loreche said.Loreche dedicated her voluntary vaccination with the Sinovac vaccine to the medical frontliners who have lost their lives in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.“I would always remember our fallen colleagues as they fought Covid with us,” she said.Around 50 to 70 VSMMC healthcare workers were scheduled to be vaccinated along with the hospital’s officials on March 4.Thereafter, the DOH 7 targets about 500 healthcare workers a day for vaccination in the coming days.Aquino said the inoculation of nurses and doctors at the Philippine General Hospital in Manila helped boost the confidence of the HCWs in VSMMC to have themselves vaccinated with the same Sinovac vaccine.The VSMMC received 7,200 doses of CoronaVac on Tuesday, March 2, the first batch of vaccines to reach the Visayas.Aquino said these will be enough to cover the second or last dose of the vaccine for the complete vaccination of priority medical frontliners.On the first day of the vaccine rollout on Thursday, 15 vaccinators were deployed by the VSMMC.Aquino said based on the guidelines, HCWs have the option to wait for their preferred vaccine brand without losing their priority status.But he said he hoped more VSMMC HCWs would trust and agree to be given CoronaVac in the coming days.Aquino said if some VSMMC health workers decline vaccination, the unused Sinovac vaccines intended for them will be forwarded to other government hospitals in the region.“I told the rest of the team of the hospital, maybe in the next third or fourth day, they can send it to whoever is on the list for vaccination,” Aquino said in a mix of Tagalog and English.
Order of priority
Those prioritized in the vaccinations are medical workers in hospitals catering to Covid-19 cases, followed by health workers in other hospitals and government-owned community-based primary care facilities.Next in line are those working in private healthcare facilities and institutions.As of March 2, 20 local government units (LGUs) in Central Visayas including the tri-cities of Cebu, Lapu Lapu and Mandaue, have created their Vaccination Operations Center (VOC) following a directive issued by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).The VOCs are tasked to prepare the masterlist of priority eligible vaccinees, existing human resources and the LGU’s needed personnel in the vaccination program.DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III who was expected to join the first vaccinations in Cebu on Thursday was unable to attend the ceremony due to the arrival of 487,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the country Thursday night.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Central Visayas will have an allocation of the AstraZeneca vaccine; however, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group will still have to deliberate on the exact number of doses to be allocated to the priority sectors.
Postponed vaccinations
DOH 7 medical program coordinator Van Phillip Baton in an earlier presentation of the region’s Covid-19 vaccination plan during the first Regional Development Council 7 full council meeting for 2021, said there will be qualified individuals whose vaccination will be deferred depending on the assessment of a medical doctor.He said those manifesting Covid-19 symptoms on the day of their vaccination will have to be rescheduled until they are fully recovered.The symptoms include fever, chills, headache, cough, colds, sore throat, fatigue, weakness, loss of smell or taste, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing.Meanwhile, those with a history of exposure to a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 case in the past two weeks will also have to be deferred until after completion of the mandatory quarantine period.Those previously treated for Covid-19 in the past 90 days will also be rescheduled after 90 days, as well as those who received convalescent plasma or antibodies.HCWs who are pregnant in their first trimester will be vaccinated only after the first trimester, while those who received any other vaccines in the last two weeks will be rescheduled after completion of the two-week interval.Those inoculated with the Covid vaccine will be assessed 25 to 35 minutes after the vaccination for possible adverse effects.Available vaccines
Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella is willing to be vaccinated should the vaccine be made available to officials.“Kung ako la’y mosunod, magpabakuna ko oy (If I had a choice, I would want to be vaccinated),” Labella told reporters.Labella said he will also not mind if he will be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine, as this has been proven effective in other countries.The Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV) Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales said 8,400 doses of Sinovac will be delivered to Bohol while 1,200 doses will be sent to Negros Oriental on Friday, March 5.Gonzales said the doses will be delivered to the Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital in Tagbilaran City, Bohol and the Silliman University Medical Center Foundation Inc. in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.In the National Capital Region (NCR), at least 9,000 received the Sinovac vaccine from March 1 to 3, 2021, data from the National VOC showed.A total of 1,184 people were vaccinated at the Philippine General Hospital, 221 at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, 148 at the Lung Center of the Philippines, 82 at the Quezon City General Hospital, 300 at the Pasay City Health office, 86 at the Ospital ng Muntinlupa and 185 at the National Children’s Hospital.A total of 264 healthcare workers were inoculated in three private hospitals: The Medical City (4), St. Luke’s Medical Center (SLMC) in Quezon City (80) and SLMC in Bonifacio Global City (180).At the Philippine National Police (PNP) General Hospital, 810 personnel were vaccinated as of Wednesday, according to PNP Deputy Chief for Administration Guillermo Eleazar.The government started implementation of the vaccination program following the arrival of China’s donation of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac Biotech.Of the number, 100,000 doses were donated by China to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1885777/Cebu/Opinion/Nalzaro-Convincing-vaccine-skeptics,Nalzaro: Convincing vaccine skeptics,BOBBY NALZARO,"February 13, 2021","My main employer, GMA 7 Network Inc., has conducted a survey among employees who want to be vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). Maybe the company is planning to purchase its own vaccines for its employees and will not wait for the government‘s free vaccination program. Media people are not on the priority list of those to be inoculated.Admittedly, I am still undecided whether to avail myself or not if there is any vaccine to be given for free from the management. If I will submit myself, maybe I will choose the brand of vaccine. Not because I am against vaccination but I have just a little reservation like so many others. This is maybe because I give more weight to the negative results of the vaccine based on the articles I have read. I have some friends even from the medical profession who, like me, are skeptical about the vaccine. But if the company’s vaccination is a must among GMA 7 employees, then who am I to refuse?A coronavirus vaccine has been heralded as the key to returning to some semblance of normal life but public health experts will first need to convince people to take it for it to be effective.Even though vaccines have virtually eliminated the risk of many preventable diseases, there have been an increase in refusal and hesitancy over the past decades. In the United States, vaccine refusal is most prevalent in wealthy, white areas and marginalized communities. Here in the country, it is a cross section in the community who are hesitant specially the parents because they still have a phobia of Dengvaxia, the anti-dengue vaccine, where many children died. Even professionals and those in the higher strata of society are hesitant because of what happened in Norway where several people aged 80 above died after being vaccinated.In January, a survey conducted by Octa Research, an independent survey group updating Covid-19 cases, showed that only 25 percent of respondents in Metro Manila are willing to get an anti-coronavirus vaccine shot when it is available. Of the 600 respondents aged 18 and up, only 25 percent are willing to be vaccinated. Most of the 29 percent of those inclined to get a vaccine were from the upper income class and middle class. Only one out of four people wants to be vaccinated, the survey showed.You see the percentage of those skeptical? The number one reason these people are hesitant is because they fear for their safety. It is now the problem of the government to convince them otherwise. It is tempting for public health communicators to dismiss those who are refusers or hesitant by broadly labelling them as conspiracy theorists or misinformed skeptics who would come around if given the facts. But mistrusting the coronavirus vaccine process — from development to trials to distribution — cannot merely be dismissed as “anti-science” thinking. It is not just an outcome of this moment’s political polarization and dangerous misinformation coming from the highest level of leadership.There are so many black propaganda and fake news about the vaccine which is one of the reasons some people are skeptical. One is because of religion or faith. In Iran, a religious leader told his supporters, especially males, not to submit themselves for vaccination because it will turn them gay.Pagkatoytoy!Ayatollah Abbas Tabrizian made these claims on messaging platform Telegram, where he has almost 210,000 followers, The Jerusalem Post reported. According to the publication, Tabrizian wrote on the platform, “Don’t go near those who have had the Covid vaccine. They have become homosexuals.” But the Iranian cleric was criticized by the LGBT community for “demonizing both the vaccine and gay community.” The claim of Tabrizian combines scientific ignorance with a crude appeal to homophobia. Homosexuality is prohibited in Iran, an Islam dominated country.Some misleading information against the vaccine is nearly identical to claims made about smallpox immunization 120 years ago. The ingredients are toxic and unnatural; the vaccine is insufficiently tested; the scientists who produce them are quack and profiteers; the cell cultures involved in some shots are an affront to the religious; the authorities work to protect public health are guilty of tyrannical overreach; and many others.How to counter these black propaganda is the problem of our government. In fact, only very few parents have allowed their children to be vaccinated in the ongoing immunization program for measles, rubella and polio because of fear.Maybe I want to see President Duterte get vaccinated in public before I submit myself to one. He is the number one endorser for the vaccination program. In the meantime, just give me enough time to think.",sunstar

'Cancelling' Tomas, Edgar and Mike. Gwen, the T word.",PACHICO A. SEARES,"December 30, 2020","FUSS OVER '50-50' VACCINEWhat we know: (1) The FDA or Food and Drug Administration said it has not authorized any Covid-19 vaccines. It will go after distributors of ""illegal and unregistered"" vaccines, FDA chief Eric Domingo said Monday, December 28.(2) Many people in the country were already inoculated with China's Sinopharm vaccines, President Rodrigo Duterte said Saturday, December 26.(3) That means, the law was violated and high officials of the land were complicit to the violation. But then who will sue high officials who ordered or allowed the vaccination? Not the FDA.How about those who submitted to the made-in-China vaccine? They assumed the ""50-50"" risk (""their personal choice""; ""no law against suicide""), unless they, especially the Cabinet secretaries and PSG members, submitted to an order they could not refuse. But then who will be sued and by whom if people die or become ill from the un-approved vaccines?Cancelling Tomas, Mike, EdOther candidates: A Facebook post by a radio broadcaster ruled out these probable candidates in the 2022 Cebu City election for mayor: [1] Tomas Osmeña, multiple-termer mayor -- ""sickly and old"" (73 next July 26); [2] Edgardo Labella, incumbent mayor, ""indecisive""; and [3] Mike Rama, ""too much in love with his voice."" ""Wa nay lain diha""? the broadcaster asked.There are other mayorables. On the BOPK side, Representative Bebot Abellanosa of the south district might run for mayor, with Councilor Franklyn Ong, Association of Barangay Councils (ABC) rep in the City Council, as vice mayor. The other probable bets are former, three-term councilor Margot Osmeña and her husband Tomas who cannot be ruled out despite Margot's reported edict against his return to politics as a candidate.In the Barug camp, Mayor Labella holds the ""equity of the incumbent"" unless plain weariness of the job or Mike Rama's persistence to make a comeback would persuade him to skip the next race. Mike is the ubiquitous factor, always in the picture as a probable runner, against the BOPK contender or even Labella himself.Or Mike might opt for the slot of congressman that Abellanosa will vacate. Three-termer Bebot might decide not to pass on to a son the slot for the seat that has kept him in the House for nine straight years. If Mike chooses to shift forums -- from the City Council as presiding officer to Congress as one among 304 congressmen and congresswomen -- he will have to persuade former councilor Joy Pesquera not to run again (her second, after her loss to Bebot in 2019).Regarding the broadcaster's reasons for cancelling Tomas, Edgar and Mike, none of those ""disabilities"" or weaknesses have stopped voters not to vote for them. Cebuanos have repeatedly sent them back to City Hall -- unless they'd set a new bar: their performance during the pandemic.Gwen 'reviled, praised'Using the 'T' word: In one of her recent press conferences from Cebu Capitol -- when she talked about the Carmen Copper landslide, the president's policy on Covid-19, among others -- Governor Gwen Garcia said about being ""both reviled and praised"" and not caring anymore about what people would say. And she slipped in the Cebuano self-deprecating phrase ""Tiguwang na ko.""It was obviously an aside, a parenthetical detour, a put-down aimed to support her unconcern about criticisms on policy or official behavior.When she said the ""T"" word, her supporters must have quickly looked at the screen on phone, tablet or PC -- and were totally unconvinced.VFA, visas; what's the dif?Element of threat: The US Government struck back at Filipino officials who are suspected of violating human rights and, more recently, harassing journalists. How? By denying the ""erring"" officials visas to the United States through a provision in separate laws.President Duterte threatened to terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) if the US would not deliver 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines.Grant of visas is the sole prerogative of the US government, which was not among the terms of the VFA. And the vaccines cannot be made a condition in the VFA since they are Pfizer's private property, unless the US government pays for the vaccines or gets it from the federal stock to deliver to us.Besides, the threat converts the request into some form of blackmail, which is in bad taste to Filipinos, if not the Americans.",sunstar

We have a total of 110 million people and around 40 million are below 18 years old, and the medical authorities do not recommend them to be vaccinated,” he said during the interview.Dominguez said 57 to 60 million people will be inoculated by the national government, accounting for the 55 percent of the population. Some 10-13 million would be inoculated by the private sector and local government units, and include those adults who don’t wish to be vaccinated.Sought for comment, Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Steven Yu said the earlier some of the citizens can get inoculated, the earlier the economic recovery will be.“The earlier we can inoculate a majority of our population and achieve herd immunity, the faster our economic recovery will be. The end of year 2021 target is already very good if it will be realized. We thought that we would reach the third quarter of 2022,” Yu said.Yu said if the prioritization and segmentation are done right, the country can achieve herd immunity with only 55 percent inoculation.“The vaccine boards of each local government unit will help, if not take charge, of the prioritization list,” he said.In an earlier interview, Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Felix Taguiam called the vaccine the “light at the end of the tunnel.”Business leaders have been banking on the vaccine to hasten the economic recovery of the country, which has been badly hit by the pandemic.

One even doubts now if America has still the moral ascendancy to lead the world and sanctimoniously preach the tenets of freedom, justice and democracy or even have the audacity to send members of Congress to third world countries to observe its election process after what the whole world have just witnessed the Trump-era election shenanigans.But that is neither here or there. What I am just saying is that with president-elect Biden at the helm of US government there is some measure of hope that he is willing to take the pandemic seriously, as he already did, by creating a team of legitimate scientific and medical experts to lead in battling one of the worst public-health crises in world history and sending a strong message that science and not politics would dictate the fight against the virus.It is simply unbelievable, as it is ridiculous and an embarrassment, that politics and political survival have been prioritized over and above the well being of every American. By sacrificing science-based practices to prevent the deadly spread of the virus America now leads in number of Covid-19 deaths worldwide – 248,585, as I write. If this is not failed leadership and an utter lack of empathy by the Trump administration, I do not know what is.What is heartening, however, is that after waiting on a Covid-19 vaccine for months, pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and BioNTech announced that it has a vaccine that it says proved 90% effective in people who aren’t known to have the coronavirus, as a result of its trials so far. The company says it tested the vaccine on 43,538 people in six countries, with no serious safety concerns found. BioNTech is a German company working with US-based Pfizer to develop a new vaccine. Other promising vaccine producers are AstraZeneca, Sanofi-GSK, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV, CureVac and Moderna..It may be relieving to know, although the reality is that being in a third world country, the waiting will be painfully longer, but still I am optimistic that the Biden presidency will lead the world in ensuring that the vaccines are safe, effective and distributed efficiently and equitably so that third world country allies can also avail themselves of it.Suffice it to say that the Biden presidency is a whiff of fresh air replacing the rancorous and fetid Trump-era presidency.",sunstar

Do our major cities have their vaccine rollout plan ironed out?Had Cebu City’s executive department been proactive in coming up with a comprehensive vaccine procurement and rollout plan as early as when pharmaceutical companies were still in the race to complete their tests, there would not have been a need for a Councilor Alvin Dizon to keep banging the Council for a Covid vaccination program (CVP).To recall, Dizon filed before the City Council on Dec. 16, 2020 a draft ordinance entitled “Covid-19 Vaccination Program Ordinance of Cebu City.” The draft ordinance provided for heavy community partnership and data-driven intervention.Dizon’s measure also mandates the creation of the “Multisectoral Covid-19 Vaccination Program Council,” which will be tasked to oversee the planning and implementation of the vaccination program. The mayor will head the body while the Council’s health committee chair will be second lead. All in all, Dizon’s draft laid out pretty much the specifics already, including schedule and venues for vaccination, and on top, mandating the City Health Department to formulate the implementing rules and regulations for the CVP.Had foresight and execution been the Cebu City Government’s foremost talents, we would have by now the mayor proudly publicizing its comprehensive plan. If the City can read the public, it would have thought that that would make a more interesting announcement than the P100,000 reward for Covid-free barangays because, really, what would the latter mean to ordinary citizens anyway.Other cities beat us to it. Makati City, for instance, had already set P1 billion for vaccine procurement. “Makatizens” can pre-register online after the City had set up a system under its comprehensive vaccination program to ensure a more systematic and safe implementation. Quezon City, on the other hand, also had allocated P1 billion for its vaccine program. The City is set to sign in the next few days with a leading supplier for its program’s first phase, which will prioritize vulnerable sectors. Like in the case of a more systematic and innovative contract tracing system, the City has to seek the expert advice of someone from far north of the country.Cebu City, which has twice the population of Makati City has, in its 2021 budget, initially set P500 million for vaccine purchase. On Dec. 15, 2020, the mayor said the money is covered by a supplemental budget in January. But, as of now, we hear from Dizon alone a more meticulous plan of a vaccination rollout. And what of the cities of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu?",sunstar

SEARES,"March 02, 2021","QUICKLY, THE SITUATION. [1] CoronaVac/Sinovac vaccines for Cebu City may arrive Tuesday, March 2. Only 3,500 doses for health personnel of Vicente Sotto hospital. None yet for the rest of the community.About 2,480 VSMMC health workers signified willingness to get the China made vaccine against Covid-19. Initial shipment to the city will be from the 600,000 doses of CoronaVac/Sinovac that arrived Sunday, February 28, in Pasay City as donation from China.[2] The Cebu City Council Monday, March 1, in a special session, authorized the city mayor to send a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) to Faberco Life Sciences Inc., which markets Covovax, signifying its plan to buy the vaccines developed by an American technology firm in Maryland, USA and manufactured by Serum Institute of India. It also gives the same authority for AstraZeneca, the vaccine produced by the British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical firm with headquarters in Cambridge, England.[3] The City Council excluded from the LOI the vaccine CoronaVac/Sinovac, produced by Sinovac Life Sciences in Beijing, China, saying it will wait for guidelines from the national government before the city will buy the vaccine, on top of the number of doses the IATF will allocate for it.[4] How long will Cebu City have to wait before getting the vaccines it will order? Vice Mayor Mike Rama, who presided Monday's special session, said national vaccine czar Carlito Galvez had told him it would take about six months. A Covovax representative told the Sanggunian that orders will be filled from the shipment it will receive this year and the excess orders in the next year's shipments.In sum, the City Government is closer to getting vaccines from the national government than from its own purchase.[5] Cebu City is ready with 10 vaccination centers, with each site having four teams that jab 100 persons each. A vaccinee has to stay for 30 minutes to one hour to be observed; thus drive-in vaccination, proposed by Councilor Noel Archival, is ruled out. Inoculation for home-bound seniors, proposed by Councilor Alvin Dizon, is considered feasible.DOES CITY LAG BEHIND? Majority Floorleader Councilor Raymond Garcia told resource persons from Faberco and Covovax the city administration is being blamed by some persons in the private sector for having not signed a vaccine supply agreement yet with any pharmaceutical firm.A Faberco representative confirmed that they ask for a letter of intent to know the number of doses the LGU needs. The firm has been working on a supply agreement with the national agreement, which it expects to finalize next week, to cover the purchase of 30 million doses of Covovax. Once that is done, the term sheet and the supply agreement with the national government will be used for the separate deals with LGUs.So no supply or purchase agreement with any LGU yet? Councilor Garcia pressed. ""None,"" the Faberco rep confirmed.That's as far as Covovax is concerned, since the cities and provinces that were earlier reported to have ""inked deals"" over vaccines contracted also with other firms such as Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Marketing procedure and policy of those firms were not known yet.Only reps from Faberco/Covavac showed up at the City Council session. A DOH official discussed safety and efficacy of Sinovac/Coronavac but not the marketing aspect.TIED TO NATIONAL GOVERNMENT. The dialogue at the special session showed that, at least with Covavac and its distribution arm Faberco, the city has to depend on national government moves and decisions.Even after the mayor issues the letter of intent to Faberco for the Covovax vaccines, they still have to wait for: (a) the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the vaccine; (b) finalization of the supply agreement over 30 million doses the national government will buy; and (c) the term sheet for the said purchase, which will be used for the LGUs' purchase.City Hall had waited for guidelines on buying, which have still to come, except for the general advice that a tripartite agreement would be needed. Now again, as far as Faberco/Covovax is concerned, after submitting its LOI, it must await the supply agreement with Manila, the EUA for the vaccine, and term sheet for the purchase.Even on the number of doses to order, City Hall must guess as it does not know how many it will get eventually from the national government. IATF was reported to have ordered 30 million doses of Covovax and 17 million doses of AstraZeneca. Neither the Sanggunian nor the officials planning the vaccine rollout have been told how many vials are allocated for Cebu City.VOLUME, PRICE. The Vaccine Convenors, which the City Council formed with the executive department, gathered consensus from government agencies and sectors in several virtual and physical meetings. Presumably it also got inputs from the Vaccine Board earlier created by the mayor.Before the Sanggunian met March 1, the convenors had reduced the number of vaccines to consider from 10 to three. Representatives from the three brands were invited to the dialogue. Only the Covovax/Faberco reps showed up. At session's end, the City Council decided to authorize the mayor to issue the LOI to buy Covovax and AstroZeneca with the volume not mentioned. Faberco told the Council members the city could send a follow-up letter that will cite the number of doses.The cost also was not mentioned. Faberco/Covovax said it still has to be set. The price they give to IATF will be the same price for local governments.",sunstar

This has become personal to a number of us, with friends and acquaintances succumbing to the virus.There can be no end to this pandemic until the vaccine is discovered, distributed and injected to those who are in need. Hopefully it will come sooner than later. In the US, there is mention of an “October surprise,” as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has scheduled the distribution of a vaccine by Nov. 1. Some experts are questioning how this is possible and warn that the US government may be cutting corners to get the vaccine out, not because to save lives, but out of political considerations as the US presidential election draws nearer.The World Health Organization has provided a draft landscape of Covid-19 candidate vaccines as of Sept. 3, listing 34 in clinical evaluation. It makes a disclaimer that the landscape documents have been prepared for information purposes only and that inclusion does not constitute any approval or endorsement by WHO of such product or entity.

Not one has reached Phase 4, which is the post-marketing surveillance in public.On Aug. 24, it was reported that 172 economies are now engaged in discussions to potentially participate in Covax, a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, once they are licensed and approved. Also, a collaboration between Serum Institute of India (SII), Gavi (The Vaccine Alliance) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation early in August will ensure up to 100 million doses of AstraZeneca or Novavax’s candidate vaccines, if successful, these will be available to low- and middle-income economies through the Covax Facility at just US$3 per dose.If Bill Gates wants to prove himself wrong in predicting that it will take years to develop a cure against the virus, then there is hope.

In fact, we won’t have any second thoughts in procuring the vaccine. However, if the National Government can provide it, then that will be better,” the mayor said in Cebuano.During Sen. Bong Go’s visit in December, Go said Mandaue City would be prioritized in the acquisition of vaccines.Cortes said he took it to mean that the City would just have to wait for the vaccines to be distributed, but it still has to coordinate with the National Government.If this doesn’t push through, Cortes said he will discuss the matter with the budget officer so they can come up with an amount that will need to be realigned.“We can tap the DRRM (Disaster Risk Reduction Management) fund. We can even sacrifice the confidential funds because our asset is the health of the Mandauehanons,” Cortes said.In a separate interview, Mayor Glenn Bercede said the procurement of the vaccine was not included during the budget hearing since it wasn’t available yet.“Naa tay budget, gani kuwang tingali basin mag-supplemental ta (We have a budget, but if that’s not enough then we’ll just pass a supplemental budget),” Bercede said.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1879860/Cebu/Opinion/Cabaero-What-passport,Cabaero: What passport?,NINI CABAERO,"December 12, 2020","With vaccinations against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) already started in several countries, there are now proposals on ways to track those protected and who may return to having unrestricted movement.The idea of a vaccine passport, also called a health passport, has been brought up in several countries, especially those that have started inoculating their citizens against the virus that causes Covid-19. What’s funny is that the Philippines is also talking about a vaccine passport even though there is no clear timetable yet when the vaccine will arrive.The vaccine created by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech has been given to the people in Britain, which authorized its use on Dec. 2, 2020, in Bahrain and then Canada last Wednesday, Dec. 9. The United States may begin its vaccination program this week following approval by a panel of experts who recommended that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.The approval of the vaccine by these countries is a step to slow down the spread of the virus and prevent serious illnesses and death. It is also seen as a way to bring back the economy and allow those protected to travel again.What is being tested is the CommonPass, a mobile application to document a traveler’s health status and as a way to bring back global travel and trade to pre-pandemic levels. Another application being developed is by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) called the IATA Travel Pass. It will document the traveler’s testing, vaccine and health waiver. This is the app that the Department of Tourism (DOT) is supporting to “restore trust and travel confidence once Covid-19 inoculation rolls out across the world.” Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat was quoted as saying the proposal for a “Covid-19 passport” is welcome and will be looked into by the DOT and the country’s Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases.Those preparations for a health or Covid-19 passport are all good as several countries start distributing the vaccine to their citizens. Such is not the case in the Philippines. The optimistic forecast is that a vaccination program can begin in the Philippines in March, but Health Secretary Francisco Duque III himself said it could start within the first half of 2021.It seems we get a different timeframe every time a government official opens his mouth to speak about when vaccination can begin in the Philippines. An early estimate was for March next year. President Rodrigo Duterte, at one point when he offered himself as among the first to receive the vaccine, said this would happen realistically in May or June. Duque’s own forecast is by June at the latest. But there were reports identifying a timeframe of within the last months of 2021 or in early 2022.Why speak of a vaccine passport when there is still no clear date on the arrival of the vaccine? Bring that vaccine here first.",sunstar

WENCESLAO,"December 09, 2020","YESTERDAY was a historic day, sort of, for mankind and a Filipina was in the midst of it. In Coventry, central England, 90-year-old Margaret Keenan became the first person to receive a Covid-19 vaccine at the start of what has been considered the biggest vaccination program in that country’s history. Britain, after all, is one of the countries worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also the first country to approve the vaccine produced by the giant pharmaceutical firm Pfizer-BioNTech. Interestingly, the vaccine was administered on Keenan by Filipina nurse May Parsons.This means that the worldwide fight against the Covid-19 pandemic is about to be won although it will take months before our fears will finally be driven away. It is fitting that a Filipina frontliner would be in the midst of this because of the role Filipinos played worldwide in easing the negative effects of the pandemic as frontliners.It is just unfortunate that at a time when we have seen the light at the end of the tunnel, dark forces are also casting shadows in social media. Anti-vaccine posts are being spread around, some of them fake news about the supposed bad effects of the vaccine on the body. This should concern us more considering how some people demonized the anti-dengue vaccine the administration of former president Ninoy Aquino purchased.And here’s another worry. The Duterte government seems to be leaning towards Coronavac, the vaccine produced by the Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, which has a record of bribing Chinese regulatory officials in relation to vaccines for other illnesses that it produced. This, plus our usual bias against Chinese-made products, should dent efforts to make the Covid-19 immunization in the country universal and effective. Of course, authorities are also looking into the efficacy of vaccines from Western firms like AstraZeneca.Then there is the cost. Coronavac’s price ranges from $30 per dose to $60 per dose. To acquire 50 million doses at $30 per dose, the government would need around P75 billion. I don’t know how big the Duterte administration’s budget is to purchase the vaccine. This would mean that administering the Covid-19 vaccine for the entire population would be slow.One advantage for Coronavac is that it can be stored without costly refrigeration. Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be shipped at -70 Celsius, which is supposedly colder than the average winter temperatures at the South Pole. Coronavac can be stored at temperatures roughly equivalent to that of a home freezer. That is one of the reasons Indonesia chose Coronavac and will start mass inoculation ahead of us.President Duterte preferred frontliners and the marginalized to be the first in line when the mass inoculation starts in the country. Senior citizens will also be given preference. The other sectors will have to wait. Which means that the whole of next year will be crucial. In the meantime, we should continue to strictly follow health protocols.",sunstar

I have no problem with that,” Labella said.“Overall, I am satisfied,” he said.Major cutsLabella’s proposed confidential funds were among those cut. Instead of the proposed P30 million, Labella’s office will get only P20 million in confidential funds.Garcia said the biggest cut was the P250 million proposed for the Phase 3 implementation of the artificial intelligence traffic system (AITS).He said there was no need to set aside funds for Phase 3 because Phase 2 of the program has not even started yet.The proposed P200 million budget for the economic recovery program was reduced by half to P100 million because there is still an existing P100 million fund for the program under the third supplemental budget approved in June 2020.The P280 million budget for the renovation of the Legislative Building of City Hall and establishment of the archives building was cut to P155 million.The approved budget for garbage collection under the Department of Public Services (DPS) was P500 million, P100 million lower than the proposed P600 million.Cebu City Councilor Alvin Dizon observed that the budget for the purchase of new motor vehicles for three offices was also removed.The executive department had proposed allocations of P12 million, P4.5 million and P5 million for the purchase of new motor vehicles for the offices of the mayor, vice mayor and city administrator, respectively.Other items that were cut from the approved budget were not specified.Dizon, in a corollary motion adopted by the Council, requested the executive department to regularly submit a report on pandemic response expenditures under the 2021 budget.The Council also requested the civil society members of the Cebu City Development Council (CCDC) to “actively” monitor the execution of the 2021 budget.Labella welcomed the Council’s request, saying it promotes transparency and acknowledging that it is the Council’s job to protect public funds.Supplemental budgetThe approved budget contains an allocation of P371 million for the South Road Properties (SRP) loan payment.Garcia said this will be augmented by a supplemental budget that will be passed in January.He said they will allocate the P830 million slashed from the 2021 expenditures program for the supplemental budget so the City can pay P1 billion for the SRP loan.Garcia said his committee had taken into consideration around 95 percent of the recommendations made during the two-week budget hearing.Dizon had objected to the proposed P120 million budget for the establishment of a command center, saying it is not urgent.Dizon previously said he was in favor of the establishment of the command center, but the allocations should be staggered.The City passed four supplemental budgets in 2020.Supplemental budget (SB) no. 1, amounting to P55 million, covered the cash incentives for City Hall employees in celebration of the Cebu City Charter Day in February.SB 2, amounting to P1 billion, covered the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) in March as part of the City’s coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) response.SB 3, amounting to P1.9 billion, was passed to augment the City’s expenses in its fight against Covid-19.The recently approved SB 4, amounting to P745 million, was used to finance the hazard pay and cash incentives, among others, for City Hall and barangay workers.

But with still no approved vaccine, she said they are also struggling to have access.With the uncertainty of the vaccine's arrival in the country, Duterte-Carpio said the City Government will continue to implement Covid-19 restrictions, particularly on mass gatherings for the next two years.She added that not all will be vaccinated due to the limited supply.The mayor said the city will be regulating mass gatherings and special occasions, including weddings and baptism.""There will still be a limitation in the mass gatherings because the pandemic will still be there next year. Tibuok 2021, naa gihapon ang pandemic. As I said kaniadto (The pandemic will still be there in 2021.

The activity is also expected to be conducted ""towards the end of second week"" or ""probably third week"" of February.The councilor described the process of the vaccination exercise wherein those who will be getting the vaccine will be placed in a waiting area before undergoing registration. Before they will be vaccinated, she said, there will be a pre-vaccination counseling, then health screening, and signing of informed consent.There will be monitoring from 30 minutes to one hour after the individual is vaccinated.With the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 being the first Covid-19 vaccine to arrive in the city, Villafuerte said the national government, through the Department of Health, is expected to ship an ""ultra low freezer"" wherein the vaccines will be stored.According to reports, BNT162b2 vaccine requires a -70 degrees Celsius storage temperature.Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio admitted in a recent interview that the city lacks adequate cold storage facilities that can meet the requirements of the vaccines.Villafuerte said the freezers will most-likely be placed at the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) the workers will be the first prioritized recipients of the vaccine.While the city Covid-19 task force has yet to finalize the identified vaccination hubs, Villafuerte said a house-to-house vaccination is not possible and is not being considered due to the vaccine's ""logistical concern"".""Kung asa naay ultra low freezer didto lang pwede magbakuna sa palibot. Dili siya pwede i-transport og layo because dili na siya mahimong effective kung mag melt siya og sayo, and ma-expose sa sunlight (The vaccination process must be conducted where the ultra low freezer is.

Among the considerations is the physical and emotional aspect of those who will get the vaccine.""On the day of vaccination, didtoa pa nato mahibaw-an kasi [through] screening if eligible sila (we would then know, through screening, who will be eligible) for the vaccination on the day. Kasi baka may sakit sila,” she said.She also assumed that those who registered are willing to get the vaccine.""We assume that if you register for the master list, you are willing to be vaccinated because part of the registration is naa kay (that you will be giving) final consent for the vaccination on the day of the vaccine. It's already a willingness yung (coming from) 3,200 plus employees,"" Ferrer said.Among the factors Audan cited is the ""Dengvaxia scare,"" which affected some of the workers’ trust and confidence towards the vaccine. The Dengvaxia of Sanofi Pasteur became an issue in 2017 after some recipients of the vaccine, mostly children, had allegedly suffered adverse effects.Audan admitted they cannot compel their employees to get vaccinated, but he emphasized that their willingness is important.""Of course we cannot force them. We are always informing them that this is not mandatory because right nila (that is their right). But we are encouraging them to have the vaccination,"" the SPMC chief said.SPMC workers will be the pilot beneficiaries of the initial rollout of vaccines coming from the national government.During the press conference, Department of Health-Davao Region (DOH-Davao) revealed that they still do not know what Covid-19 vaccine Davao City will be receiving and that they are still awaiting the national government's confirmation.She said based on information they received, vaccines are set to arrive in the country on February 12, which will most likely arrive in the city on the same day.Audan said they still have to conduct a separate simulation exercise for the vaccination rollout in the hospital.Ferrer said they will conduct the vaccination in batches to avoid overcrowding and to ensure that operations of the hospital won't be affected.In a previous SunStar Davao report, Davao Medical Society (DMS) president Dr. Jose Beltran Jr. said some medical practitioners are having reservations about getting the Covid-19 vaccine due to various reasons.He said this was the sentiment of some of their members who are from different medical fields and specializations.Some of its members said they do not want to be inoculated with Covid-19 vaccines coming from China, India and Russia.""Kung dili kuno gikan sa US (United States) or Europe, dili sila magpaturok (If the vaccines will not be coming from the US or Europe, they won't be vaccinated),"" Beltran said.He explained that they are critical about the efficacy rate of the vaccines coming from these countries.",sunstar

If they will say yes, then we will start the process of contracting with other companies.

There is also no guideline yet if the local government units (LGUs) will be allowed to coordinate with vaccine manufacturers on their own.In a previous report, the mayor said the City Government first approached an official of one of the drug companies, who told her to formally write to them but later on replied that it is not for profit and would only set it to the Department of Health (DOH).The other company encouraged the city government to participate in Phase 3 of the clinical trial.In her latest interview, she said another foreign drug official reached out to her days after her pronouncement on the city's move to buy vaccines. The mayor said their country allows them ""to sell [the vaccines] to whoever is the buyer.""The official, however, said they cannot deliver the vaccines in the country since it needs approval from DOH and Food and Drug Administration (FDA).As of Friday, the national government has not granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to any vaccine brands.An EUA is a formal document that will speed up the processing time for approval of a certain vaccine, particularly for Covid-19, that will enter the country – from six months to 21 days.President Rodrigo Duterte in early December signed Executive Order (EO) No. 121, which grants FDA the authority to issue EUA for Covid-19 treatment drugs and vaccines that are still under development.""We are waiting for that document so that we may know what brand sa mga (of) vaccines ang gitagaan og EUA sa national government so that maka-pursue pud ta sa ila (that could have been granted EUA by the national government so that we could pursue to them as well),"" Duterte-Carpio said.For now, the mayor said all their negotiations are only “explanatory talks,” adding that having an authorization document could help them in their negotiations with vaccine-makers.The mayor said the local government deemed that they have ""local options"" in accessing the vaccines to help the national government in expediting vaccine access faster within localities.""Naga-try na ta og seek out og mga kompanya nga makita nato sa mga balita nga duna nay mga bakuna because wala may mawala sa atoa if they say no (We are trying to seek out companies, based on news reports, that have already produced the vaccines.

Nahatagan na pud ta og authority gikan sa Sangguniang Panlungsod para mopirma. Gi-submit na nato tanan sa ilaha,"" Duterte-Carpio said on Monday, January 11, 2021.(All the necessary contracts that AstraZeneca asked from us have been signed and submitted to them. The Sangguniang Panlungsod has given us the authority to sign the documents.)But what are the details behind the vaccine of AstraZeneca? Here is #AllYouNeedToKnow about Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZenecaThe Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, also known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and AZD1222, is a viral vector Covid-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom (UK).According to AstraZeneca, its vaccine ""uses a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees and contains the genetic material of the Sars-CoV-2 virus spike protein.""""After vaccination, the surface spike protein is produced, priming the immune system to attack the Sars-CoV-2 virus if it later infects the body,"" the pharmaceutical company said.According to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, ""Viral vector-based vaccines differ from most conventional vaccines in that they don’t actually contain antigens, but rather use the body’s own cells to produce them.""""They do this by using a modified virus (the vector) to deliver genetic code for antigen, in the case of Covid-19 spike proteins found on the surface of the virus, into human cells. By infecting cells and instructing them to make large amounts of antigen, which then trigger an immune response, the vaccine mimics what happens during natural infection with certain pathogens - especially viruses,"" Gavi explained. The harmless virus delivering the genetic code is called an adenovirus.This is the same technology being used by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology for Sputnik V. This is also being used by China’s Cansino Biologics, Inc. for their Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate and Johnson & Johnson's Janssen for their JNJ-78436735. All three and AstraZeneca are currently in Phase 3 of their vaccine development.Safety and efficacyBased on the interim analysis by Oxford University, which has been peer-reviewed and published in The Lancet on December 8, 2020, Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca ""has an acceptable safety profile and has been found to be efficacious against symptomatic Covid-19 in this interim analysis of ongoing clinical trials.""Trials were conducted in Brazil, South Africa and the UK.""The participants were from diverse racial and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions,"" AstraZeneca said.In a statement, AstraZeneca said the study showed that the vaccine efficacy of Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca was at 90 percent when given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart. This dosing regimen was given to 2,741 participants.In another dosing regimen, the vaccine showed 62 percent efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart. This dosing regimen was given to 8,895 participants.""The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent,"" AstraZeneca said.The efficacy of the vaccine was based on the trials of participants from the UK and Brazil.Meanwhile, safety data showed that Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca ""was well tolerated and that there were no serious safety events confirmed related to the vaccine."" The safety study was based on trials participated by over 20,000 participants from Brazil, South Africa, and the UK.""The participants were from diverse racial and geographic groups who are healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions,"" AstraZeneca said.According to the study published in The Lancet, the vaccine ""is tolerated and that the side-effects are less both in intensity and number in older adults, with lower doses, and after the second dose.""However, researchers of the study also pointed out that ""careful monitoring of safety, including neurological events, continues in the trials.""Researchers also said in the interim analysis of Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, they ""have not been able to assess duration of protection, since the first trials were initiated in April 2020, such that all disease episodes have accrued within 6 months of the first dose being administered.""The vaccine can be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.AstraZeneca and PhilippinesAstraZeneca's vaccine has become a popular choice among local government units in the Philippines.As of January 15, 39 local government units have signed agreements with AstraZeneca, National Task Force Against Covid-19, and the Department of Health. Some 300 private companies have also signed a tripartite agreement with AstraZeneca and the government.Quezon City has the largest purchase order with 1.1 million doses of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca. Makati City has the second largest order with 1 million doses.Other LGUs that have signed purchase deals are City of Manila (800,000 doses), Valenzuela City (640,000 doses), Iloilo City (600,000 doses), Caloocan City (600,000 doses), Zamboanga City (410,000 doses), Pasig City (400,000 doses), Baguio City (380,000 doses), Las Piñas City (300,000 doses), Ormoc City (270,000 doses), Parañaque City (200,000 doses), Ilocos Norte (120,000 doses), Oroquieta City (120,000 doses), Vigan City (100,000 to 120,000 doses), Navotas City (100,000 doses), Muntinlupa City (100,000 doses), Bacolod City (P300 million), Mandaluyong City (P200 million), San Juan City (P50 million), Taal City (40,000 doses),Davao City (no available data), Taguig City (no available data), and Pasay City (no available data).On January 15, Island Garden City of Samal Mayor Al David Uy said the city government will sign an agreement with AstraZeneca for the procurement of around 50,000 to 60,000 doses.General Santos City is also working on its agreement with the pharmaceutical company to secure vaccines. Mayor Ronnel Rivera said that based on the proposed deal with AstraZeneca, it may be getting around 330,000 doses.On January 14, 2020, AstraZeneca, the business community, and LGUs had a ceremonial signing for the procurement of 17 million doses, including the first vaccine deal of 2.6 million doses in November 2020, of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca.""We are delighted to conclude 17 million doses, which can reach millions of Filipinos through the close collaboration between AstraZeneca, the Philippine government, local government units, and private sector donors,” Lotis Ramin, AstraZeneca Philippines country director, said during the signing ceremony.At present, AstraZeneca's application for the emergency use authorization of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is now pending with the Food and Drug Administration.The Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca is expected to arrive in the Philippines around the second half of 2020.Davao CityDuterte-Carpio, meanwhile, said AstraZeneca has informed the city government that their vaccine could arrive around the third quarter this year.AstraZeneca is the first vaccine manufacturer that the city government has entered a deal with for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines.Duterte-Carpio said they have informed AstraZeneca in October 2020 of their intent to procure Covid-19 vaccines.""As early as October nagsulat na ta sa ilaha na dunay ta'y interest nga mupalit og bakuna sa ilaha. They were aware of that intent since October (They were aware of our intent to purchase vaccines from them since October last year after we reached out to them),"" the mayor said.However, compared to the other LGUs that are getting doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca, the mayor said the number of doses the city is getting from the company is not that many.""Katong order nato with AstraZeneca, gamay ra kaayo to compared sa makit-an nimo sa orders sa ubang LGUs (Our orders from AstraZeneca, is quite small compared to the other LGUs that ordered from them),"" she said.Hence, the city will be multi-sourcing its Covid-19 vaccines to be able to vaccinate its target of some 1.2 million residents of Davao City.She said at present, no Covid-19 vaccine manufacturer could immediately meet the needed doses of vaccines. This is due to the high demand but limited supply of Covid-19 vaccines nationwide.Therefore, the need for the city to procure vaccine from other pharmaceutical companies. Last week, the mayor said they are in talks with another company.Multi-sourcing will also allow the city to lower the risk of having a large group of the population experiencing adverse side-effects from a vaccine.""Tungod kay kining vaccine bag-o, wala ta kabalo unsa side effects niya... We were thinking, dili tanan apektado sa complications sa isa ka bakuna (The vaccines are new and we do not know much about its side effects yet. We were thinking that we do not want everyone experiencing complications from a single vaccine),"" she said.As to the budget, the mayor said there will be no limit to how much the city can spend for the vaccine, as long as it will meet its target number of individuals that need to be vaccinated.Global sceneTowards the end of 2020, AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine was approved for emergency supply in the United Kingdom.Argentina's National Administrator for Food and Medical Technology also approved the vaccine for emergency use around the end of December 2020. The South American nation will buy 22.4 million doses of the Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, according to reports by Reuters.It has also been granted emergency use in India, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, and Morocco for the active immunization of adults.",sunstar

The American firm recently signed an agreement with Serum Institute of India for mass-scale production of the vaccine for developing and low-income countries.""We're starting our documentation karon [aron] magpalit og certain number of doses sa (for us to secure several doses from) Novavax,"" the mayor said.She said the city government's action is in anticipation when ""the national government will not be able to fulfill its commitment in augmenting vaccines for all"".""Because wala'y anything on paper with regard to sa number of doses nga pwede nila ihatag sa LGU (it is not stated on paper with regards to how many doses they can allot for LGUs),"" Duterte-Carpio said.Duterte-Carpio also confirmed in a recent interview that the City is also under negotiations with Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Johnson & Johnson) for the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines.The city is targeting to immunize at least 1.2 million out of the 1.8 million total population of the city to achieve herd immunity.",sunstar

Karon mas kompleto na (that we need to add things in our ordinance. This time, it is more complete),"" Villafuerte said in an interview on 87.5 FM Davao City Disaster Radio on January 29.During the second reading, the councilor said they already identified the priority eligible groups for the vaccination.According to the ordinance provision, ""the implementation of the actual phases depends on the delivery (timing, available doses, logistical requirements) of vaccines to the country.""It also states that the deployment shall be based on the sectoral approach within each priority group. If possible, the ordinance said, the guidelines in the Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for Covid-19 Vaccines will be followed.Priority groups are Group A which include the frontline health workers, both public and private, indigent and non-indigent senior citizens, indigent population as determined by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), and all enlisted uniformed personnel.Group B includes all teachers and school workers, government workers, essential workers who are similarly providing basic services during the pandemic as determined by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), socio-demographic groups at significant higher risk other than senior citizens such as persons deprived of liberty (PDLs), persons with disabilities (PWDs), indigenous people and those living in high-density areas.Also included in Group B are those eligible students in all levels upon the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (Nitag), Filipino migrant workers who reside in another country for a limited period of employment that were not vaccinated, and all workforces as determined by DOLE, DTI, and the Civil Service Commission (CSC).All remaining Filipino citizens not mentioned in Groups A and B are part of Group C.The ordinance also states that the immunization program will run until at least 70 to 85 percent of the population in the city is immunized for the purposes of herd immunity.Villafuerte said they have also decided to create a Covid-19 Immunization Program Task Force and a Vaccination Operation Center. The Local Adverse Event Following Immunization Committee was also necessary for any events during the vaccination campaign.She added that they have also presented in the Task Force Covid-19 and the city council a penalty clause.""We have a penalty clause pero dili didto sa mga magpabakuna kundi didto sa mga mogamit og bakuna na dili authorized, katong mga untrained na mag-una-una og bakuna sa mga katawhan, kanang magbaligya (We have a penalty clause not for those who will be vaccinated but for those who will use unauthorized vaccines, those untrained [individuals] who will vaccinate people, and those selling vaccines),"" Villafuerte said.Meanwhile, the National Government has already implemented the deployment plan for Covid-19. In line with this, the Davao City Health Office (CHO) is working on the master list of those included in the Group A.Villafuerte, however, clarified that a person's inclusion in the master list does not mean the person will be vaccinated immediately. She said the vaccination will be voluntary. There will be counseling to be conducted by licensed personnel who are trained by the Department of Health (DOH) or CHO.If the person decides to receive the vaccine shot, they will sign an informed consent form provided by the DOH. Part of the screening is a physical exam to know whether they are fit to be vaccinated.""After they are vaccinated, they will be kept in another room for 15 to 20 minutes to conduct a post-vaccination monitoring for acute allergic reactions to the vaccines,"" Villafuerte said.She said that after one month of the first dose, the person receiving the vaccine will be monitored by health professionals. If something happens in the next four weeks, Villafuerte said, it will still be considered an ""event after immunization.""""We only identified the priority groups, but there are exemptions. Those who are not yet ready to be vaccinated will be automatically exempted. There are those who are declared by the medical professionals to have allergies, and adverse reactions to vaccines, those who have physical conditions that are not allowed to be vaccinated,"" she said.She also said the City Council has prioritized the creation of the ordinance to prepare for the vaccination and to ensure that the process of vaccination in the city is guided and well-planned.""We hope that with these systems in place it will reassure our people in Davao City and will make them more responsive to the call of the government for vaccination,"" the councilor said.

Yup, I look forward to stepping out of the house without fear of contracting the virus, minus the face mask and shield, mingle with family and friends, hug them and travel!But before you hop on that plane and head off to your favorite out-of-town destination after your shot, why not give local tourism its much-needed shot to jumpstart the local community’s economy? By local, I mean Davao City. Give love to your hometown.That’s what I intend to do. I actually started before the lockdown was implemented, when the scare of the pandemic was slowly crawling into our lives and the local economy was slowing down. I called for “travel local” and kicked off the series of staycations at Park Inn by Radisson Blu. Unfortunately, the lockdown came and the series was cut. I’m reviving it as soon as I get vaccinated.True, I could still have done the staycation series pre-vaccine, but I’m not the brave one. Covid-19 has hit too close to home. I’ve seen friends lose their loved ones. I’m not gambling.Let me share my list. Enjoy a couple of nights in these beautiful places.Park Inn by Radisson Blu. If you're a shopaholic and a foodie, the hotel’s location is perfect for you as it is connected to a mall. But the hotel has its offerings that will keep you indoors. For one, the burger is wicked! The healthy drinks will go perfectly while lounging by the pool on a hot day, and you can call for a therapist for a relaxing massage.Seda Abreeza Hotel is also right across a mall. It may be a business hotel but it’s also a great place to escape from the daily grind without driving far. The rooms are totally relaxing and breakfast is great. You will love the kakanins (local delicacies) among the typical breakfast offerings.Waterfront Insular Hotel Davao offers the best of both worlds. It’s a seaside resort hotel but within the city. Who doesn’t want waking up to fresh sea air blowing from Davao Gulf, it's therapeutic, so is the green expanse. To complete the paradise experience, the food is superb. Aside from the favorites—pizza, halo-halo, etc., the new chef is whipping her magic on the menu.Eden Nature Park & Resort. If you love the late autumn chill, this is the perfect time to stay in this mountain resort. The forest vibe – verdant greenery, sunlight peeking through towering trees, crisp mountain air—is healing, and that’s what we need after months of seclusion. Food is fresh since they harvest it from the “backyard,” and outdoor activities are adrenaline-rushing.From the highlands of Eden Nature Park head to Island Buenavista. The sister resort is a tropical paradise! It’s like your own private island that you can hike from end to end. It’s blessed with a wide white-sand shoreline, cool and clear blue water, and lavish greenery (where the living quarters are ensconced) to contrast the blue and whites of the delightful picture before you. Oh, the food is great, too! The fresh coconut treat is just perfect for this setting.Exploring more of the islands, Dusit Thani Davao’s island resort is Lubi Plantation, in Kopiat Island. The island destination also makes for a perfect escape from city life. If you like luxury, then this is a place for you. Living spaces are modern takes on villas in a plantation with its own private pool with a view of the sea. The setting can be very romantic.Who doesn’t love Pearl Farm Beach Resort? The first luxury destination in Davao and Mindanao is still a favorite after three decades. Built-in the former pearl farm in the Davao Gulf, the natural and well-designed architecture by a renowned architect and an interior motif that speak Davaoeño made the place iconic (a photo by the Parola is a bragging right). In this resort, one night is never enough.Once you’ve made your rounds, travel farther to the neighboring Davao provinces, they all need the help we can give.***Follow jeepneyjinggoy on Instagram and FacebookFor more photos about this feature and other travel stories, visit www.jeepneyjinggoy.comFor lifestyle features, visit www.ofapplesandlemons.comEmail me at jinggoysalvador@yahoo.com",sunstar

ARADO,"September 03, 2018","CERVICAL cancer is the second deadliest cancer among women next to breast cancer. In the official website of the Department of Health, it says that an estimated 7,277 new cases occur annually and about 3,807 of these end up in death.The primary cause of cervical cancer is the human papilloma virus (HPV) that is transmitted through sexual intercourse. However, there are also special cases wherein females who have yet to have sexual intercourse still had cervical cancer. One reason is that HPV can also be spread by skin to skin genital contact with or without sexual encounter. The HPV infection can affect both males and females. As HPV infection does not have early symptoms, it can develop into cervical cancer later in life.Only a few people know that even if cervical cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women in the country, this is preventable through HPV vaccine. Below are five things you need to know about HPV Vaccine:1. HPV Vaccine can be given to girls as young as 9 years oldThe Department of Health (DOH) had been guaranteeing the safety and effectiveness of this vaccine and had since been giving it to elementary students for free. As women of all ages are advised to be vaccinated with HPV vaccine, it is the most effective among young children who have yet to have sexual activities. In Davao City, the City Health Office had been giving free HPV vaccine to elementary female students from 9-13 years of age.2. There are two types of HPV vaccine: Cervarix and GardasilCervarix are vaccines given to prevent cervical cancer HPV types 16 and 18. They are given for three doses at 0, 1, and 6th month. On the other hand, Gardasil had been noted to prevent genital warts, vaginal vulvar, and cervical cancer HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18. They are also given in three doses at 0,2, and the 6th month. A patient can choose whether to avail of the Cervarix or the Gardasil vaccine as they also vary in prices per shot. As males can also have HPV infection, Gardasil is also given to males.3. Vaccines are readily available in your OB-Gyne's clinicWhether or not a woman already had her sexual encounter, the DOH encourages everyone to have their HPV vaccine already to decrease the risk of having cervical cancer later in their life. They are lucky if their local health offices offer free HPV vaccines. Otherwise, vaccines can also be taken from a trusted gynecologist's clinic or in authorized pharmacies. Price ranges from P2,000 to P4,000 per shot.4. Effect of HPV vaccines lasts a lifetimeEven if they may be a little pricey, the effect of the vaccine, once the three shots had been taken, is a lifetime. The DOH and other private health sectors continue to encourage women and young girls to be vaccinated and be safe from the future effects and risks of HPV infection and cervical cancer. They also encourage those who had taken their first shot to strictly follow and take their second and third shots as well.5. It had been used by DOH for decades nowFilipinos may have second thoughts about vaccines now after the issue with Dengvaxia. However, Dr. Julinda Acost of the City Health Office assured that they have been using HPV vaccine for their medical missions for decades now and they can attest of its safety. Last June 2018 their office used about 13,000 vials of Gerdasil vaccines for free vaccination to elementary students in the city.",sunstar

Ready na tang tanan (we will not be having last-minute preparations. We will be ready in its implementation), including the workforce, and the process in the implementation of the immunization process,"" the health official said.Considering the city is ""highly urbanized"" with a huge population, it is unlikely that it will be implemented in weeks or months.""It will take about one to two years to cover the immunization in the whole Davao City, that's why a proper plan should be done at this time and level,"" Lopez said.He added that preparations must be made since the city will most likely be prioritized in availing of the vaccines.Villafuerte, meanwhile, said that while everyone will be given the vaccine, the vaccination will be implemented in phases.""Vaccines will be given in phases aron dili tanan magdungan adto sa mga (so that there won’t be an influx in the) health centers,"" she said.Specific sectors to be prioritized have yet to be determined, but these would include frontliners. It is still not clear, however, if the “frontliners” would be healthcare workers or those non-healthcare workers.As of now, Villafuerte said the city cannot yet determine the budget to be allocated in the procurement of the vaccines despite the early pronouncement of Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio that the city has enough fund to personally procure the authorized vaccines once these will be certified by the national government.Villafuerte, who is the committee chairperson on health, said the ordinance will specifically detail the implementation of the vaccination, the number of vaccines to be procured, and how and where to store them.""We have to be ready for facilities because some vaccines have to be stored in very cold facilities. Who will be doing it? Is it the city government or the drug company?"" Villafuerte said.The need for healthcare workers who will be conducting the vaccination must also be addressed in the ordinance.With various misinformation circulating online on the alleged hazardous effect of the vaccine, Villafuerte said the city will be conducting an information drive to make the public aware of the effect of the vaccine and its expected adverse effect.A separate committee will also be formed to cater to reports on those who will be experiencing side effects once injected with the Covid-19 vaccine.She said the crafting of the ordinance will be transparent and that all concerned stakeholders will be invited during the committee hearing.",sunstar

PEREZ,"March 05, 2021","WHEN a barangay health worker went house-to-house to ask residents in Bangkal, Davao City about their willingness to accept Covid-19 vaccine, 55-year-old online worker Tejhay (not his real name) declined due to fears of possible complications.For Alek, a tricycle driver in Jacinto St., Davao City, he wants to wait and observe first the results of the first few batches of individuals who received their vaccine jabs.""Maayo ng makasiguro usa ta, kanang makita na gyud nato kung okay ba gyud na nga vaccine. Hulat-hulat sa ko (It is better to be sure and see the results first of how the first few individuals responded to the vaccine. I'll wait and see),"" he said.Tejhay and Alek are just a few of the many Filipinos who are still doubtful of the vaccine's efficacy despite multiple clinical trials proving it is safe and effective.According to Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency that granted Sinovac's emergency use authorization (EUA) on February 22, the vaccine's efficacy rate after two doses is at 50 percent for mild cases, 78 percent for moderate cases, and 100 percent for severe cases, similar to the other novel Covid-19 vaccines.With these established, how will the Department of Health (DOH) fight this misconception and fears from the general public?Vaccination startsOn Friday, March 5, 2021, Davao Region started its vaccination program against Covid-19 at the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC) with jabs from Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac, which arrived this week in two batches with 12,000 doses on March 2 and 21,600 doses on March 4.The region, at present, has a total of 33,600 doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine.DOH-Davao Director Annabelle P. Yumang said the available vaccines can inoculate a total of 16,800 healthcare workers in the region.""They will receive two doses of CoronaVac, with a 28-day interval from the first dose,"" she said.In Davao Region, apart from SPMC, the vaccination activity will also be rolled out to other provinces, depending on the readiness of the different Local Government Units' implementing sites.Yumang said the vaccination in Davao de Oro and Davao Regional Medical Center (DRMC) in Tagum City, Davao del Norte will start on March 8.""From the regional office, ang vaccine i-tratravel po siya doon sa kanya kanyang provincial health offices,"" Yumang said.She said based on the survey they conducted, 79 percent of DRMC's employees are willing to be vaccinated.Yumang added that they are still collecting data as to the vaccine acceptance of the other provinces.To allay fears of the public and fellow frontliners, SPMC officer -in-charge Dr. Ricardo Audan volunteered to be the first health worker inoculated with CoronaVac.""I know many of you are still scared to be vaccinated. That is why I am volunteering myself to assure and show everyone that this is safe and effective. Disregard your fears and doubts now and let's unite to end the pandemic,"" he said on Friday, minutes before he got his jab, which was personally inoculated by DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III.Frontliners' experiencesAfter Audan, 149 more health workers from SPMC received the vaccine on the first day of rollout.""The goal is to inoculate 150 employees a day. We initially target to finish the vaccination for the first dose for 12 days but we were told to double time and committed to doing it in five days or a week,"" Audan said.One of the first four health frontliners who received the vaccine is Dr. Almera Manan, an Internal Medicine resident in SPMC for three years. She was one of the thousands of medical workers who contracted the virus while on duty. She got infected in April last year and recovered in the same month.""I was afraid before when I tested positive for Covid-19 because we only know a little about the virus back then. But now, I have no second thoughts of receiving the vaccine because this is our best defense against the virus,"" she told SunStar Davao in an interview while she was still under monitoring for 30 minutes after the inoculation.All vaccine recipients were mandated to stay in a designated observation area for 30 minutes to check if they feel any adverse effects caused by the vaccine.She emphasized that it is her personal choice to be inoculated and nobody forced her to receive it.For Dr. Edmundo Visitacion Jr., a pathologist and regular consultant at SPMC, getting the vaccine is the best protection an individual can have in the long run.""Since I am a doctor, I know that only vaccines can give us protection in the long run. If we don't have a vaccine, the possibility of getting Covid-19 is still high,"" he said.He also added that the vaccine administrators secured their informed consent and that they underwent a health screening to ensure that those who will be vaccinated are eligible.Infectious disease specialist Dr. Marie Yvette C. Barez also shared she felt completely normal after getting her CoronaVac jab.""I am okay. I do not feel anything weird or bad. As an infectious disease specialist, it is my responsibility to protect myself, family, and even the community. Having the vaccine will protect the people,"" she said, adding her daily exposure to the virus makes her even more willing to get vaccinated.""Vaccine has always been there to prevent the infection. Even before, we already have vaccines, it is just that this is a new virus. We have been receiving vaccines against measles, flu, etc., so why are we afraid of this vaccine?"" she added.She also reminded those who received the vaccine to still observe and maintain health protocols as the majority of the population is still not inoculated.Meanwhile, for a 33-year-old SPMC nurse Jon Rey V. Estuya, the arrival of the vaccine is a ray of hope, especially for frontliners.""I've been in the fight against Covid-19 for a year now, and I'm lucky enough to not contract the virus. But the daily fear is always there. With the vaccine, the anxiety and fear we feel every day were lowered, we are now more hopeful that there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said.Estuya has been an SPMC employee for a decade now.For a health worker who is dealing with Covid-19 cases daily, Estuya shared that getting a jab is what he has been hoping for months since the start of the pandemic.""Daily, I am dealing with Covid-19 cases, even with the PPE on, I am still afraid, not just for myself but more on the possibility of bringing the virus to my home where my senior citizen parents and pregnant wife are,"" he shared.""Nalipay gyud ko na naabot na ang vaccine (I am happy that the vaccine has finally arrived here). And if ever I'll test positive for Cvid-19 - God forbids - at least, with the vaccine, I won't be a severe or critical case,"" he said.Vaccination campaignTo further raise awareness about the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, the Presidential Communications Operations Office-Office of the Global Media and Public Affairs (PCOO-OGMPA) launched on March 3, a series of explainer videos dubbed ""The VAXplainer.""""The VAXplainer is only a part of our numerous efforts and commitment to make Filipinos fully understand the importance of vaccines and convince them to be inoculated with the available safe and effective vaccines provided by the government,"" PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar said in a press statement.The first episode of the VAXplainer focuses on the personal experience of Philippine Ambassador to Bahrain Alfonso Ver in getting vaccinated during the first phase of Bahrain's vaccination program from December 2020 to January 2021.""The VAXplainer"" can be viewed on PTV and IBC-13. It will also be live-streamed on the PCOO, National Task Force Against Covid-19, and Department of Health Facebook pages, as well as other government-affiliated social media pages.In Mati City, Davao Oriental, the city government conducted a three-day information dissemination campaign on Covid-19 vaccination on March 3-5.The city has already identified 24,000 individuals as priority for the vaccination. The list includes 400 health workers, other frontliners, senior citizens, and families in the lowest income bracket.",sunstar
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1868701/Davao/Feature/AllYouNeedToKnow-Sputnik-V,#AllYouNeedToKnow: Sputnik V,REUEL JOHN F. LUMAWAG,"August 30, 2020","ON OCTOBER 4, 1957, Sputnik 1 was launched by the Soviet Union into the Earth's orbit making it the world's first artificial satellite.On August 11, 2020, another Sputnik has made a mark in world history. However, this time it is not an artificial satellite. On this date, Sputnik V was registered by the Russian Ministry of Health making it the first registered coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine on the market.Sputnik V, developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology (Gamaleya Center), is among the over a hundred vaccines being developed by scientists and medical community in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.However, despite being ahead of the pack, there are still skepticisms from the scientific community due to how fast the Russian institute was able to develop a vaccine in a short amount of time.Dr. Alexander Gintsburg, Director of Gamaleya Center and Academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said they were able to develop Sputnik V quickly due to the availability of an existing technology and utilizing what they have learned from their existing vaccine project: vaccine for the Middle East Respiratory Virus (MERS).MERS-CoV, which causes MERS, and the Sars-CoV-2, which causes the Covid-19, are coronaviruses.""Work on the MERS vaccine enabled us to quickly and efficiently come up with Sputnik V and have it registered,"" Gintsburg said in an online briefing with the foreign press on August 20, 2020.He said the team working on the MERS vaccine are also the ones who are working on the creation of the Covid-19 vaccine. Hence, causing a temporary delay on the MERS vaccine.TechnologyThe Sputnik V is an adenoviral vector-based vaccine.According to the official Sputnik V website, ""vectors"" are vehicle that can induce a genetic material from another virus into a cell.""The gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed while a gene with the code of a protein from another virus spike is inserted. This inserted element is safe for the body but still helps the immune system to react and produce antibodies, which protect us from the infection,"" reads the description on the website, sputnikvaccine.com.Adenoviruses are pathogens that commonly cause fever or coughs. In the development of the Covid-19 vaccine, the adenovirus has been genetically engineered to combat the coronavirus.Aside from the Gamaleya Center, other manufacturers using the adenoviral-vector technology to develop a Covid-19 vaccine are CanSino Biologics, Johnson & Johnson, and the University of Oxford.Gintsburg said the use of the adenovirus vector is nothing new. It is a technology that the research center has been developing since the 1980s. It is the same technology that they used to develop three vaccines against Ebola fever. All three are approved for use by the Russian Health Ministry.He said after monitoring some 2,000 volunteers in the Republic of Guinea and Russians engaged in the country, they saw that an adenoviral vector-based vaccine was able to create a proactive immune response to those who were given the Ebola vaccine.According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), adenovirus vaccines are also being used in the U.S. Army but it is currently not available to the public.""Adenoviral vectors are considered extremely safe, and are some of the easiest to engineer. Vectors are viruses that have had the gene responsible for replication removed. Therefore, they no longer pose any threat of infection. Scientists use vectors to transport genetic material from a different virus - the one that is being vaccineated against - into a human cell,"" the Sputnik V website states.Dr. Denis Logunov, Deputy Director for scientific work of Gamaleya Center and Correspondeming member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said Sputnik V is a two-vector vaccine, which sets it apart from other Covid-19 vaccines that are adenoviral vector-based. The first vector is based on the adenovirus 26th serotype and the second is the 5th serotype.""Both components are administered one after another,"" he said. The second component of the vaccine is given after 21 days.Gintsburg said administering the vaccine twice is called a booster vaccination method. Through this method, those who are vaccinated with Sputnik V will be able to have a stronger immune response to the virus.""We see from the research that two injections will provide for a long term immunity and many companies have decided focus on this approach,"" Logunov said.He cited the study of AstraZeneca, a British multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company that is also developing a Covid-19 vaccine.""AstraZeneca has demonstrated that out of the 1,000 participants in the first and second phase, they provided two injections to only 10 participants. Those 10 participants received four times more antibodies compared to those who had only one injection,"" Logunov said.The Gamaleya Center has also developed two forms of the vaccine.First is the fluid form that is stored in -20 degrees Celcius and the second is lyophilized form that can be stored in temperatures of 4 degrees Celcius.Both Logonov and Gintsburg assures that the use of human adenovirus for the development of vaccine is a safe technology. Both cited how it is a well-studied technology that has been used and tested on many people.It was also stated on the website of Sputnik V that there are more than 350 scientific studies available worldwide on adenovirus vectors.""This is not just another vaccine, it is a modern generation vaccine. It was developed on the basis of the latest achievements of molecular biology, virology and immunology, which means that it is an evidence-based vaccine. Even though the post-registration clinical trials are only starting now, we already know today that the vaccine gives a good immune response or develops antibodies. It also gives a good cellular response and most importantly is harmless. The vaccine registration was perfectly justified, and I think it will be the first effective medication - it has everything [to become one],"" Russian health ministry Rakhim Khaitov was quoted saying in an August 27 report by TASS, a Russian state-owned news agency.Clinical trialsLogonov said they have already completed their pre-clinical trials on the fluidized and lyophilized (freeze-dry) forms of the vaccine on non-human projects.The vaccines were tested on hamsters, mice, rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, and two types of primates -- rhesus monkey and marmosets. Researchers used different models for the testing of the vaccine.""The vaccine has demonstrated high safety profile and were assessed highly by the Ministry of Health,"" Logonov said.He said based on the research, the tests done on the primates have not demonstrated any Antibody-dependent enhancement impacts.""All the vaccinated primates were fully protected and no damage were inflicted on their lungs,"" Logonov added.During the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, they also tested the fluidized and lyophilized forms on healthy volunteers who are 18 to 60 years old.According to ClinicalTrials.gov of the U.S. National Library of Medicine, clinical trials for Sputnik V were done on June 17, 2020 and was completed on August 10, 2020. A total of 38 participants were tested using the fluidized form and another 38 for the lyophilized form.According to the website, Gamaleya Center has not yet posted its results.However, Logonov said based on their clinical trials, results were promising.""There was a very good profile of safety, not a single side effect was registered,"" Logonov said.He said they also assessed the efficacy of the vaccine in terms of immune response.""We have demonstrated that 100 percent of volunteers have virus-neutralizing antibodies,"" Logonov said.On August 11, the Russian Ministry of Health issued the vaccine's registration certificate ""under emergency rules adopted during the Covid-19 pandemic.""""Clinical Phase 1 and 2 have shown that 100 percent of volunteers received a very strong immune response,"" Logonov said.On August 24, post-registration clinical trials started.""It will see 40,000 volunteers get vaccinated, while high-risk groups can get vaccinated simultaneously, primarily doctors and teachers,"" Khaitov said in the August 27 report of Tass.The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Philippines, and possibly India or Brazil are expected to join the clinical trials of Sputnik V.Logonov said they are ready to supply vaccine to the external market in November after the mass vaccination in Russia that is eyed to begin in October.PH-Russia cooperationRussian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev said in an online interview with SunStar Philippines on August 20 that Russia is offering Philippines several areas where the two nations can collaborate.""While we welcome contributions from all the parties concerned, primarily we would like to develop “Sputnik V” in cooperation with our close partners like the Philippines,"" he said.These areas of collaboration are: exchanging information on development and clinical trials of the Russian vaccine; conducting clinical trials of the vaccine on the Philippine soil in order to verify its efficiency and safety and to complete the relevant registration procedures in full compliance with the local legislation; supplying the vaccine to the Philippines; sharing technologies and manufacturing the vaccine on the Philippine territory.""I am pleased to say that Russian and Philippine experts have already started exchanging opinions on the technical aspects of conducting the abovementioned trials in the Philippines,"" Khovaev said.In an August 28 PTV report, Department of Science and Technology's panel of vaccine experts are now reviewing the documents on Sputnik V.Philippines is presently part of the World Health Organization's solidarity trials on Covid-19 treatments. Dr. Jaime Montoya of the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development said in the report that there are also two vaccine developers planning to have clinical trials in the country too.Khovaev said there is also the possibility that the vaccine could be locally produced in the Philippines.""This transfer of technology will open up new horizons for bilateral economic and scientific cooperation because the technology in question can be used in a whole variety of fields. Not to mention that it will likely make the Philippines a regional hub for the anti-Covid-19 vaccine,"" Khovaev said.President Rodrigo R. Duterte, during his August 11 public address, said the Philippines is ready to accept the offer of Russia on the vaccine.""Kaya ngayon tinatanggap natin at kung ano ang supply mag-usap pa kami kung ilan ang supply at kailangan natin (We are ready accept their offer and we will discuss as to how much supply we will need),"" he said.The president also expressed high hopes for the Sputnik V.""Sabihin ko rin kay President Putin na...malaki ang tiwala ko sa pag-aa-- (I will tell President Putin that I trust) your studies in combatting COVID and I believe that the vaccine that you have produced is really good for humanity,"" Duterte said.The President also said he is willing to be administered with the Sputnik V first.""Pagdating ng bakuna, in public, para walang satsat diyan magpa-injection ako. Ako yung maunang maeksperimentuhan. Okay para sa akin (When the vaccine arrives, I will volunteer and publicly be experimented with it first so people won't say anything),"" Duterte said.Khovaev said the Philippine government has been ""enthusiastic"" with their offer.""Apart from that, we are getting a lot of positive feedback from Philippine parliamentarians and businesspeople. A lot of them are asking how they could help to expedite the process of bringing the vaccine to the Philippines,"" he said.SkepticismDespite the advancements the Gamaleya Center made, it is not without skepticism by the scientific and medical community.“It’s a too early stage to truly assess whether it’s going to be effective, whether it’s going to work or not,” said Dr. Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at England’s University of Southampton, in an Associated Press report on August 12.Catherine Smallwood, a senior emergency official at the World Health Organization-Europe, said in a separate Associated Press report on August 20 that, ""This concern that we have around safety and efficacy is not specifically for the Russia vaccine, it’s for all of the vaccines under development.”She said it is important for vaccine manufacturers to not to cut corners in safety or efficacy.“We’re not going through a rushed job of trying to jump to conclusions here...We want to take our time to really understand where the vaccine’s at and to get as full information as possible on the steps that have already been taken,” Smallwood said.Khovaev said the skepticism from the medical community, especially from Western countries, is normal.""On the one hand, I think it is normal because it is only human natureto be skeptical towards something new... On the other hand, a fair share of the skepticism regarding the safety of the Russian vaccine is nothing but an attempt to undermine the results of the work of Russian scientists for political and commercial reasons,"" he said.Currently, there are over a hundred Covid-19 vaccines that are being developed, including the Sputnik V. Each vaccine is on different phases of its trials.While we wait, the development of the vaccine has given people a glimmer of hope amid the Covid-19 pandemic.""Russia is indeed the first country to have developed and registered a working Covid-19 vaccine. We consider this not only the achievement of Russian scientists but also a major breakthrough for the entire world. The Covid-19 pandemic is an enemy that no single country big or small is able to defeat by itself. The pandemic can only be overcome by joining the efforts and resources of all responsible nations. This is why we are inviting partners and friends to participate in the final stages of development of the vaccine,"" Khovaev said.",sunstar

ALIVIO,"January 20, 2021","MINORS will not be included in the Covid-19 vaccination program to be rolled out soon by both the national and local governments, said health officials in Davao Region.During the Kapihan sa DavNor on January 20, 2021 that was streamed live on Philippine Information Agency-Davao and Davao del Norte Facebook pages, Dr. Jasmin de la Cruz, Pediatric Infection Diseases specialist and Medical Officer IV at the Infection Control Unit of the Davao Region Medical Center, said that so far, the Covid-19 vaccines will only be rolled out for the adults.""Wala pa man guy directive sa Covid-19 vaccine para sa mga bata, since wala pay studies sa Covid-19 vaccine sa mga bata (There's no directive yet to include the minors in the Covid-19 vaccine since there are no studies yet about the Covid-19 vaccine on children),"" De la Cruz said.Dr. Raquel Montejo, operations chief of Covid-19 Vaccination Program in Davao Region, also reiterated De la Cruz's statement during the One Davao on Covid-19 virtual presser on the same day.""Yun pong ating desisyon na 18 and above ang bakunahan ay base na ron po sa product insert ng mga vaccine manufacturer, kasi po each product meron po silang product insert, parang information about vaccine tapos doon po nakalagay ang age kung sino dapat bakunahan (Our decision to only vaccinate those who are 18 years old and above is based on the product insert of the vaccine manufacturers. The product insert provides the information on the vaccine and those who can be inoculated with the vaccine),"" Montejo said.Montejo added that this may be because the pharmaceutical companies who manufactured these vaccines only conducted the studies on the adults.In the news report from AP published on December 17, 2020, the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine that was authorized in the US to be used this month is only for people 16 years old and older.They began testing children as young as 12 in October last year and the testing is expected to take several more months.Moderna, meanwhile, began enrolling study participants ages 12 to 17 last month, which will run for a year. Their testing in children younger than 12 is expected to start in early 2021.With this, the health officials encouraged the adults to get themselves vaccinated against Covid-19 as a means to protect the children.""Ang mga bata dili man ang source sa Covid-19, ang adult man jud gud... So kong maproteksyonan nato ang mga adults, or ibig sabihin dili na sila magkasakit og Covid-19 through sa vaccine dili na pud sila makatakod sa mga bata, kasi sa pagkakaron wala pay vaccine sa Covid-19 para sa mga bata,"" De la Cruz said.(The children are not mainly the source of Covid-19 but the adults... So if we can protect our adult, or if they will not get infected with the Covid-19 through getting a vaccine, they could not anymore infect children, since to this day, there's no Covid-19 vaccine yet for the children.)She added that the children's trend of Covid-19 cases may not be that alarming but if the cases for adults continue to increase, it can be expected that the children's cases will increase as well.""Pero siyempre kay nagadaghan man ang adult cases, mura'g muduyog pud ang cases sa mga bata... Kay kung dagha'g adults nga ma-infect, naa man pud sila'y mga anak (Since the trend in Covid-19 cases is increasing in the adult, cases in children also increase because most of these adults have their own children),"" De la Cruz said.",sunstar

LLEMIT,"January 24, 2021","AN OFFICIAL from the Department of Education-Davao Region (DepEd-Davao) is ready to support the government’s vaccination program if the agency will be tapped but underscored that administering the vaccine should be left to medical professionals.DepEd-Davao Spokesperson Jenielito Atillo said in a radio interview that Education Secretary Leonor Briones or the department itself has not issued any statement following the recent reports that the Department of Health (DOH) will be tapping teachers as part of the vaccination teams that will undergo training.DOH spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire clarified that the role of teachers in vaccination teams will be for health education only and the vaccination itself will be done by health professionals.Atillo also reiterated Vergeire's statement, adding that the department is willing to support the program.The DepEd official admitted they were surprised to receive such reports and that he immediately sought verification on this as the head office has not issued any statement on this plan.""Wala mi problema ana [teachers in the information campaign]. Dali man lang na para sa magtutudlo. Pero katung kami mugunit sa heringilya and mutusok sa bukton didto di na pwede. Unang una, ang magtutudlo, tudlo lang iyang trabaho,"" Atillo said.(We do not have a problem tapping our teachers in the information campaign. I’m sure it would be an easy task for them. But, we cannot have our teachers doing the vaccination itself because, in the first place, their task is to teach.)He said they are open to the idea of tapping medical practitioners who are working for DepEd, particularly those designated school nurses and doctors in respective schools.""As of now, wa pa’y klaro kung involve ba mi and extent sa amo’ng involvement. Pero musuport mi. (There are no clear details on how and to what extent we will be involved in this program, but we will support it.) [Although] we have to wait for the official instruction coming from the Secretary going to the field on the ground,"" Atillo said.In a Facebook message to SunStar Davao, Alliance of Concerned Teachers-Davao City (ACT-Davao City) Division President Reynaldo Pardillo said they were not surprised upon hearing the initial reports.""We teachers were the last resort of every task that our government would like to initiate. In the election census, module producers, and even modules writer and hauler. Even in the deworming and feeding program for the malnourished learners. It is not that we are 3-in-1 teachers but many in one as long as we can serve the most of our learners [sic],"" Pardillo said.While he said that they will be supporting the plan of tapping them in the information dissemination campaign of the government, he said teachers must be well-oriented in order not to cause misinformation.""Diha ta murag makuyawan. Kay kani bayang mga parents og mga bata mutuo baya dayun sa amoa. Kay teachers lagi daw (We are a bit surprised because parents and our students, considering we are teachers, believe easily in anything we say or impart to them),"" Pardillo said, adding they do not want to experience the same lack of training particularly in the creation of modules.In case the government decides to deploy them as vaccinators, he said they should be given proper training and justified compensation for their effort.""If possible, teacher vaccinators should be ensured not only on the medical assistance but a proper insurance policy that somehow will be claimed if there will be something that happens to our teachers,"" the ACT leader said.",sunstar
https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1883283/Davao/Opinion/Velez-Why-the-lack-of-trust-on-the-vaccine,Velez: Why the lack of trust on the vaccine?,TYRONE VELEZ,"January 19, 2021","ISN'T it everyone's wish this 2021 for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to go away so we can resume our lives? So why is there a lot of talk about not trusting the vaccines that are set to be rolled out later this year?The latest survey from Pulse Asia (if you still believe in this firm) conducted from November 23 to December 2, 2020 showed only 32 percent or three of 10 respondents who are willing to be vaccinated. Visayas had the highest rate of mistrust at 55 percent followed by Mindanao with 48.And half of the people in the lower class don't want to get vaccinated.Around 84 percent of these respondents cited safety issues as their concern. Perhaps this is in reaction to the dengvaxia controversy that caused some deaths among children. The Department of Health noted a drop of children availing the vaccination program in recent years. It also did not help how the pro-government social media army fanned this hysteria and now it is fanning back at them.Another reason is how the government is not answering the questions on two vaccines they are acquiring. Aside from Pfizer and AstraZeneca, the government has negotiated for Sputnik V vaccine from Russian's and CoronaVac from China's Sinovac. These two vaccines have not been subject to peer review, and only have press releases to back their claim of high efficacy.The importance of peer review in scientific studies is to ensure quality control to prevent scientific misconduct. So if someone sells you a drug, you'll trust it is good when doctors say it is good. That's better than having a salesman convincing you better take this, because you've been buying everything Chinese all your life.Dr. Gene Nisperos of Community Health and Development points out that the government's tone so far is to make people obey and tell them, wag maging choosy. ""Kung ayaw nyo, wag nyo!

You increase confidence by providing answers to their questions,"" he said.Concerns about vaccine safety are true and legit. That is why members of the Philippine medical community are speaking out. They say what is needed is to be transparent, to communicate, explain, and make people understand how vaccines work.

After which, a 28-day gap will be observed before the second dose.The inoculation of the Sinovac BioTech vaccine to the medical frontliners is expected to commence today, March 5, 2021 at the Southern Philippines Medical Center (SPMC). Only the frontliners who are younger than 60 years old will be given the Sinovac. Those who are older will have to wait for other vaccine brands to arrive.Out of the 16,600 frontliners, 5,900 will be coming from SPMC and 2,000 under the Department of Interior Local Government (DILG).There has yet to be details as to whether or not additional Sinovac BioTech will be delivered to Davao Region but Yumang expressed gratitude for the increased number of frontliners eligible for vaccination in the region.In a Facebook post by PAL Spokesperson Cielo Villaluna, she said this forms part of the 600,000 doses of Sinovac allocated by China for the entire Philippines.

This already includes those working in the public and private health facilities, the public health workers and local government unit (LGU) contact tracers, barangay health workers, and those working for the departments of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), Education (DepEd), Interior and Local Government (DILG), Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP), and the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor).They will be followed by indigent senior citizens (3.8 million), remaining senior citizens (5.7 million), remaining indigent population (13 million), and uniformed personnel such as the Philippine National Police (PNP), Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), Bureau of Fire Protection (BFP), and Civilian Armed Forces Geographical Unit (Cafgu) (more than 500,000). These groups will make up the first priority eligible group.Making up the second priority eligible group are teachers and social workers (1.2 million), other government workers (1.7 million), other essential workers outside health, education, and social welfare sectors (1.7 million), socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than SCs and IPs (1.8 million), overseas Filipino workers (1.7 million), and other remaining workforce (1.3 million).The third priority eligible group are remaining Filipino citizens.Each individual will be inoculated with two doses. The numbers, she said, are still expected to change as the study continues to progress.""We have already started our training in terms of deployment. We have e-learning module available on our website. Private sector, private health workers will vaccinate their own staff in their facilities.

Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines may also arrive in the country in February through the Covax initiative of WHO.Galvez said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be available in Metro Manila, Cebu City, and Davao City, cities where cold storage facilities are available.Cabotaje emphasized that distribution and deployment strategies will vary depending on the temperature requirement of the specific vaccine as there are vaccines requiring -20°C and the others -70°C.While Cabotaje understands that permission to be individually vaccinated is voluntary, she said they call for proper information dissemination to further educate Filipinos of the vaccines.When asked whether or not those who have Covid-19 history be inoculated with the vaccine still, Cabotaje said this will vary on the specific vaccine to be used.""General rule from WHO, the presence or absence of Covid-19 should not be deterrent to vaccination. However, we are now looking at what different vaccine manufacturers have submitted to the FDA. We will have specific guidelines for different vaccines. [For example,] with Pfizer BioNtech - you defer the vaccination 60 to 90 days if nag-positive ka,"" she said, adding that they are just waiting for the final release of guidelines before they can incorporate this to DOH's Deployment and Vaccination Plan.",sunstar

(BOC will conduct pre-clearance documentation so that when the shipment arrives, they will only inspect the box.)The vaccines will undergo inspection at the RITM two to three days before these are distributed to the end user.Galvez said there is no room for errors in the handling because the vaccines are “very delicate.”“The more na matagal ang vaccine outside of the warehouse, malaki ang possibility na magkaroon tayo ng spoilage...

Many of them were infected with Sars-CoV-2 and the disease has claimed the lives of several others. Some of them have not seen their families for months due to fears of infecting them; others are being put under lots of stress; several others have also been discriminated against by their neighbors or relatives.Did the people who decided to have some members of the PSG vaccinated first not think about how this could potentially demoralize some of the health workers, who have been risking their lives since the pandemic began?In a post by the Philippine Television Network, the Department of Health has identified frontline health workers in public and private sectors, local government unit contact tracers, barangay health workers, and other national government agencies as the first priority groups for Covid-19 vaccination in the Philippines.The second priority is indigent senior citizens, the third is other senior citizens, the fourth is the remaining indigent population, and the fifth is the uniformed personnel.With the recent incident, some uniformed personnel has jumped the line. The recent incident is also unfair towards the Department of Health (DOH), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and those who are tasked to secure vaccine doses in the country. The incident is also a disrespect towards the rules and regulations surrounding the distribution and use of the vaccine.""DOH maintains that all vaccines should undergo the evaluation and regulatory process of our regulatory and expert bodies...

Only Pfizer has applied for a EUA. What has been recently approved is the clinical trials of Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.Also, the lack of transparency by the Armed Forces of the Philippines and PSG on how it was able to secure the vaccine and who had administered it, raises a lot of questions. Who else jumped the line and bypassed the process of FDA? How transparent is the government with the procurement of the Covid-19 vaccine?At the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, the government's messaging was ""We heal as one."" How can ""We heal as one"" if the list of individuals prioritized for vaccination is not followed? How can ""We heal as one"" if the proper process for acquiring vaccine is not followed and had undergone below questionable means?We do not ""heal as one"" if we allow the bypassing of existing rules and regulations and jumping the line before those who needed it most.",sunstar

In a recent radio interview, Davao City Mayor Sara Z. Duterte-Carpio said some of the AstraZeneca vaccines the city will be getting are expected to arrive around the third quarter of 2021.Despite the positive developments and optimism towards the Covid-19 vaccines, some individuals are still hesitant to be inoculated with one due to safety concerns. This is quite understandable considering that the vaccines have been developed at a very short timeframe compared to other vaccines on other diseases.Between now until the time a vaccine is available for you or in your area, it would be a good time to start reading about the vaccines that are being procured by the national government and the local government unit (LGU).If you really want to know about the vaccine, the pharmaceutical companies have all the necessary information they have on their respective websites.You can also check peer-reviewed studies in The Lancet, a general medical journal. Peer-reviewed studies on the vaccines of AstraZeneca and Gamaleya Institute are published in The Lancet.Following credible news or medical sources could also provide you much-needed information on the Covid-19 vaccine you are about to get.The national government also has to act fast with the communication campaign it will roll out on the vaccination program. It also has to hurdle misinformation challenges, especially on the lingering effects of the Dengvaxia scare around two to three years ago.As we wait for the vaccines to arrive, let us take this time to understand and know more about the Covid-19 vaccines that will be available to us.",sunstar

These vaccines also differ from one another: viral vector-based vaccines, virus-based, nucleic acid-based, and protein-based vaccines.While the knowledge that a vaccine will be available to everyone soon, the distribution of the vaccine is more complicated than we think. How will the vaccine supply chain cope with global demand? How can vaccine manufacturers ensure the quality while mass producing the vaccine? Who are the priority sectors for the first batch of vaccination?The Philippines cannot simply purchase or ask donations of vaccines. What it also needs is a comprehensive vaccination program for Covid-19, which the government has yet to present to the Filipinos.So far, what we are getting from our government leaders, including the president, is there will be a vaccine soon, who will be the possible priority sectors to receive it, and the estimated budget to procure it. However, there is no comprehensive plan for the country's Covid-19 vaccination program yet.We saw how our government's seemingly reactive response to the Covid-19 pandemic led to having the most cases in Southeast Asia and having the longest lockdown in the region. Therefore, while the vaccines are being developed and finalized, it is a good time for the government to be proactive and start coming up with a concrete plan on how the vaccination program will be for the Philippines.Definitely, we are hoping that the government will first provide vaccination to the health workers, who have been tirelessly working in treating Covid-19 patients in the hospitals. They very much deserve to be the first batch to receive the vaccine because they are the ones who are dealing with Covid-19 patients. In a sense, it is also cost-effective if the government vaccinates the health workers and other frontline workers first.However, in a Philippine News Agency report on August 3, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte said the police and the military would be among the first to receive vaccines, noting that he needs ""a strong backbone."" He also said underprivileged Filipinos would also be prioritized. Sadly, there was no mention of prioritizing health workers. It is not like the police and military will take over the treatment of Covid-19 patients when the government fails to vaccinate the health workers and they all get infected with the virus.The government also needs to consider the cost of the vaccination.However, it seems like the government has this covered already.Department of Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said the government can set aside P20 billion to buy the vaccine. Funding will be sourced with the help of the Philippine International Trading Corp., Land Bank of the Philippines, and the Development Bank of the Philippines.The President also said the vaccination will be free for the poor, police, and military while the rich and drug personalities will pay for theirs. How about the middle-class Filipinos, overseas Filipino workers, and health workers? There is no mention if their vaccination will be free, subsidized, or will they pay for it?However, the funding seems like for the initial phase of the vaccination only. What are the government's plans post Covid-19 pandemic?There are also the questions on who will administer the vaccine. Will the DOH be the one to do it? Will it be coursed through the designated Covid-19 hospitals in the country?While the country waits for a vaccine, the government should use this time to develop a comprehensive plan on Covid-19 vaccination. The plan must provide in detail how the government plans to procure the vaccine, source funding for it, its distribution, and the priority sectors that will receive it. This is to ensure there is a smooth distribution of vaccines and also to prepare the different sectors who will be involved in this.",sunstar

Currently, these vaccines are in various stages of development.However, one country may be ready to release the Covid-19 vaccine earlier than others.Russia has been vocal about how it may have a vaccine ready by October this year.Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev said during an online press conference on August 7, 2020, they are now just waiting for the documentary approval before the country conducts mass vaccinations.The vaccine is being developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. The development and production of the vaccine will be funded through a joint venture between the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) and R-Pharm Group.According to the RDIF, the sovereign wealth fund of Russia, the vaccine's distinct characteristic is its ability to reduce the time needed for a person to develop immunity from the virus. The vaccine's first clinical trials were conducted in the middle of June 2020.However, the World Health Organization and scientists have expressed alarm over the rush in the development of the vaccine in Russia.""I'm worried that Russia is cutting corners so that the vaccine that will come out may be not just ineffective, but also unsafe,"" said Lawrence Gostin, a global public health law expert at Georgetown University, in a report by the Associated Press (AP).According to the AP report, ""Russia has not yet published any scientific data from its first clinical trials. The WHO's list of vaccine candidates in human testing still lists the Gamaleya product as in Phase 1 trials.""Gostin expressed concerns that a vaccine in a short amount of time could do more harm than good.""What if the vaccine started killing them or making them very ill?"" he said.The skepticism of the scientific community over the vaccine of Russia is not surprising. Considering that scientific data is not available yet.Also, according to the AP report, Russia has only used the vaccine on 76 people, who are reported to be doing just fine.However, a mass clinical trial has yet to be conducted. It is here where the scientific community will see how the population will react to the vaccine.Also, scientists have yet to determine the long term effects of the vaccine, if there are any. This is considering that clinical trials and research on the vaccine is being done in a much shorter period compared to the development of other vaccines.Every step being done for the development of the vaccine is crucial. We do not want to aggravate the current situation that we are in right now.While we are hopeful for the vaccine to be ready soon, we are also hoping that the vaccine will be safe for everyone.Meanwhile, President Rodrigo R. Duterte, in a public address on Tuesday evening, expressed his willingness to help Russia in its clinical trials. He also invited the country to invest in the Philippines for the mass production of the vaccine.""Malaki ang tiwala ko -- your studies in combatting Covid and I believe that the vaccine that you have produced is really good for humanity,"" Duterte said.",sunstar

This means gathering together, traveling without worries, or simply going out without having to wear a face mask.As the vaccination across the country kicks off, we are hopeful of better days ahead.This week was generally filled with good news.On March 2, the first batch of Sinovac's Covid-19 vaccine, CoronaVac, arrived in Davao City. This batch includes 12,000 doses of the vaccine.On March 4, an additional 21,600 doses of CoronaVac arrived in Davao Region.With the additional doses, Department of Health (DOH) Davao Director Annabelle Yumang said they have increased the number of expected medical frontliners to be inoculated with the vaccine. Starting on March 5, around 16,600 front liners will be inoculated with the vaccine.Also on the same day, 487,200 doses of Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca arrived in the Philippines at around 7:10 p.m. at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. In a SunStar Philippines report, this is the first batch of the 4.7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines that the Philippines is programmed to receive under the first round of Covax allocations.Through Covax, the Philippines has been allocated 4.584 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines and 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.Meanwhile, in a social media post by the President Communication Operations Office (PCOO) on February 16, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said the Philippines has enough doses to vaccinate around 70 million adult Filipinos by the end of the year.Based on the list provided, the Philippines is expected to receive:* 44 million doses through the Covax Facility starting February with 4.7 million doses to be delivered in the first round of allocations* 25 million doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac starting February* 10 to 15 million doses of Gamaleya's Sputnik V starting April* 30 million doses of Novovax's vaccine starting May* 17 million doses of Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca starting May* 20 million doses of Moderna's vaccine starting July* 15 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine starting August but as of February 16, this is still under negotiations* Five million doses of Johnson&Johnson's single-dose vaccines starting OctoberDespite the controversies prior to its arrival, the Covid-19 vaccines arriving in the country also bring hope for better days.Of course, while we wait for the target population to be inoculated with the vaccine, let us continue to follow strictly the minimum health protocols. The vaccination program and compliance to health protocols will help control and manage the spread of the Covid-19.We are optimistic that the coming days and months will be better.

It was the president himself who showed it off to the media. What does this mean for sports now that the vaccine is here?It is almost a year now that sports activities have been limited or stopped. There is still no clear direction for the resumption of amateur sports as well as professional sports. Even the training and participation of our national athletes in international competitions are dependent on vaccination. There is even an on-going appeal to include athletes in the priority list for vaccines alongside our front liners. For whatever it's worth, vaccination seems like the only way to go for the desired normalcy in our affairs, including sports.Almost everyone was anticipating the availability of these vaccines to at least curb the infection of Covid-19. A lot has been hampered by this pandemic. As per experts, while vaccines will not prevent one from contracting the virus, they can only lessen its ill effects on the individual affected. I think this is fair enough for the return of sports in the country. If we allow our athletes to participate in sports, we have to keep them safe for their peace of mind, well-being, and families.Here’s hoping that the available vaccines make their way to those that need them, including our athletes and sports practitioners.Notes from the sidelines:Shout out to the SRK riders for conquering Davao-Digos-Davao last Sunday. SRK is composed of different coaches from different sports disciplines brought together by biking and the need to keep active even with the pandemic’s limitations. We may not practice and play the games we love, but biking has allowed us to become involved and engage in sports again, till the next long ride with everyone.And to those we met along the route-remember to stay safe, keep hydrated, and enjoy the rides.",sunstar

This is a huge difference from the 835 cases and 13 deaths in the entire 2019.Acosta said the strict quarantine measure, which prohibits children from going out, had contributed significantly to the low measles transmission.But she said the CHO is still not complacent in their efforts to immunize all children from the dreadful virus.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), measles is a highly contagious viral disease. It remains the top cause of death among young children globally, despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine.It is transmitted via droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat of infected persons. Initial symptoms, which usually appear 10 to 12 days after infection, include high fever, a runny nose, bloodshot eyes, and tiny white spots on the inside of the mouth. Several days later, a rash develops, starting on the face and upper neck and gradually spreading downwards.Acosta said the city will roll out a city-wide immunization activity this year amid the continuing threat of the Covid-19.To ensure that health protocols will be followed and mass gatherings will be avoided, CHO will conduct the vaccination drive in fixed posts like barangay health centers, health stations, nutrition posts, as well as temporary posts such as covered courts, instead of the previous house-to-house strategy.She said the city targets to vaccinate more or less 150,000 children aging 9 to 59 months regardless of immunization status to make sure that there is no child left behind.""This is so ma-ensure talaga natin ang proper screening and precautionary safety protocols. The measles vaccination kasi is injection, hindi patak. Dapat maganda yung area sa immunization sites (This is to ensure the proper screening and precautionary safety protocols since the measles vaccination is administered through injection, not drops. There must be proper immunization sites),"" Acosta said.Acosta said the movement restrictions brought about the quarantine had resulted in a huge number of children unvaccinated.""These children are susceptible to the disease and they need to be vaccinated in order to prevent a possible outbreak,"" the health official said.With this, she hopes that parents would have their children immunized because measles is a deadly disease but can be prevented through a vaccine.""We encourage parents.

It is also expected to arrive in the third quarter of the year.In different reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) and other international news organizations, Astrazeneca and Janssen are among the available vaccines that have low-temperature requirements at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius only.Meanwhile, Pfizer BioNTech, which the city will be receiving from the National Government, requires cold storage facilities to have minus 70 to minus 75 degrees Celsius temperature capacity.Currently, the City Government and Department of Health (DOH) Davao Region have yet to find a cold storage facility that can meet Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine's temperature requirement. The National Government has begun negotiations with logistics companies including Zuellig Pharma Corporation which has a branch in Davao City.Meanwhile, Lopez said all applications to be official cold storage facilities for vaccines must be coursed through DOH Davao Region.",sunstar

Maghiusa gihapon tang tanan (This is not the time to be divided. We have to unite). Maghiusa gihapon ta (We have to unite) towards our common goal of security and development here in our city,"" Duterte-Carpio said in an ambush interview right after the Rizal Day commemoration ceremony at the Rizal Park on Wednesday morning, December 30.In her previous radio interview, the mayor admitted that things will still not go back to normal until the vaccines will be rolled out to the public.The mayor said she is hopeful that with the recent progress in the development of the vaccines, the pandemic would eventually end soon.""But sa makita nato, magpadayon gihapon ang kalisod karong 2021 (What we are seeing is 2021 may still be a difficult year),"" Duterte-Carpio said.In her recent interview, the mayor said the City Government had already drafted its vaccination program and had allocated funds for the city to procure vaccines, that will be given ""emergency use authorization (EUA)"" by the national government. To date, no vaccine has been issued a EUA by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The local government is also still waiting for further guidelines from the national government on the procurement of vaccines.The mayor recently announced that all existing Covid-19 regulations and policies in Davao City, including the curfew, 24-hour liquor ban, and prohibition of mass gathering, will still be implemented next year.She said the City Government will be issuing an executive order (EO) on Wednesday, December 30, extending the provisions of the four previously issued EOs, which are set to end on December 31, 2020.These are EO 55 (An Order Enforcing Curfew And Regulating Other Activities), EO 56 (An Order For Adoption Of Other Alternative Work Arrangements In Public And Private Offices), EO 57-A (An Order Regulating Mass Gatherings and Prohibiting Nonessential Travel Within Davao City and for Other Purposes), and EO 59 (An Order Reimposing A 24-Hour Liquor Ban in Davao City).But as of Wednesday afternoon, the city has not yet released a new EO on its official social media accounts and website.The mayor, meanwhile, said the city did not record a sudden spike during Christmas Day, which they anticipated in the past days.One of the reasons she cited is the recent regulations to mitigate the spread of the virus.""We implemented a lot of executive orders aron macontrol ang movement sa tao because ang virus mupaspas iyang pagkuyanap kung mnaggawas ang mga tao (to control the movement of the people because we expected the transmission to pick up its pace as more people go out of their homes).

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1887569/Davao/Opinion/Editorial-Rushing-to-quash-disinformation,Editorial: Rushing to quash disinformation,,"March 02, 2021","NOW that the government has received vaccines for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the government and health authorities are now facing quite a big challenge: the disinformation on vaccines.There is a lot of disinformation regarding vaccines going around the internet. Individuals who are keen on spreading disinformation seem to have been working double-time to get their message across. As a result, legitimate and science-based sources are being drowned out by the spread of disinformation.Aside from those who are anti-vaccines (Anti-vaxxers), the aftermath of the Dengvaxia scare has also resulted in reservations among many Filipinos.The government has been constantly posting on social media education and information materials on vaccines. Most of the materials are detailed, some in Filipino and others are presented as infographics.Government and health officials are also regularly seen in large media outfits to talk about the vaccines. Their messages are written or broadcasted by news outfits of different mediums.However, are the government and health officials doing enough to put a stop to the spread of disinformation when it comes to Covid-19? A quick look on social media shows that there are still individuals who still do not understand the concept of vaccines. These individuals are easily swayed by those spreading disinformation.Also, the masses, in general, are not able to immediately access legitimate and scientific-based information. Coupled with that are the scientific jargons that are not easy for many to fully understand.Hence, it is important for the government and health officials to go down to the grassroots to explain the vaccines and the vaccination program. The government has done several communication campaigns on polio, dengue, and measles that were cascaded to the barangay level and proved to be effective. Therefore, they can do it when it comes to communicating Covid-19 and vaccine.What could also be done is localizing communication strategies to better communicate the vaccine to the people. This means maximizing the unit handling communications in the Department of Health or that of the local government unit.To be able to vaccinate more people, not only does the government need to procure the vaccines, but there is also a need for the government to persuade people to get the vaccine. But the rampant spread of disinformation is a big challenge to get people vaccinated. Hence, it is now key for the government and health officials to properly and effectively communicate matters about the vaccine.",sunstar

Duterte-Carpio has made it clear on Monday (January 18, 2021) that the City Government will not force the residents to be inoculated with the vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).""Masking dili nato ma-reach ang herd immunity, dili nato pwede na pugson ang tao para magpabakuna (Even if we won't be able to reach our targeted herd immunity, we cannot force the people to have themselves vaccinated),"" Duterte-Carpio said on Monday, January 18, 2021, in an interview on 87.5 FM Davao City Disaster Radio.She added there will be no penalties for those who will refuse the Covid-19 vaccine.Eric Domingo, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) director general, also said Filipinos will not be forced to be inoculated with the vaccine.""Wala naman po talagang pwedeng pilitin para bakunahan. Hindi po kayo pwedeng pilitin at hindi po tayo pwedeng sapilitan, kapag tayo ay nagpabakuna kailangan naiintindihan natin kumpleto kung ano ang benepisyo at adverse events, side effects o risks nito (No one can be forced to be vaccinated. You can't be forced and we can't make it mandatory; when we take the shot we must understand completely the benefits and adverse events, its side effects or risks),"" Domingo was quoted saying a Philippine News Agency (PNA) report.It is the very right of a person to refuse to be inoculated with a vaccine. This is not something new to our society as there are several sectors that refuse to get one because of different reasons. There are sectors that do not want to be vaccinated for religious reasons; others may have been misinformed; there are also those who are truly anti-vaccines.There are also those who understand the need to get a vaccine and how it works but would temporarily refuse to get one because they want to wait for a better vaccine or want more information regarding it.However, it is also important for the country to be able to vaccinate as many Filipinos to achieve what health experts call a ""herd immunity.""World Health Organization (WHO) defines herd immunity, also known as ""population immunity,"" as the indirect protection from an infectious disease that happens when a population is immune either through vaccination or immunity developed through previous infection.""WHO supports achieving 'herd immunity' through vaccination, not by allowing disease to spread through any segment of the population, as this would result in unnecessary cases and deaths,"" WHO said in a press release dated December 31, 2020.Hence, communication and transparency will play a key role in letting Filipinos understand the importance of the Covid-19 vaccine and at the same time debunk myths created by those spreading disinformation.For a government whose vaccine program has been gravely affected by the Dengvaxia issue several years ago, the Philippine government will have to make an extra effort in communicating the information about the vaccine to the public.The government and vaccine manufacturers have to also be transparent and ready to answer any issues surrounding the vaccine.Inoculation of the Covid-19 is not mandatory. But for the nation to lower its Covid-19 infections and manage the risks caused by the disease, there is a need to vaccinated as many Filipinos as it can. One of the ways it could achieve that is by properly informing and making Filipinos understand the vaccines they are about to get.",sunstar

These facilities can store up to 6.5 million doses.The company's walk-in freezers, capable of temperatures ranging from -50 to -25 degrees Celsius, can hold 40 million doses.Secretary Vince Dizon, deputy chief implementer of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, said in a press conference that they were in talks with 28 cold chain services providers that can also store vaccines at low temperatures.Negotiations were also being held with five other cold chain operators, he added.The government expects delivery of at least 92 million doses of candidate vaccines against Covid-19 this year.As of January 19, Malacañang said Galvez has secured the supply of 30 million doses from Novavax, 25 million doses from Sinovac, 17 million doses from AstraZeneca and 20 million doses from Moderna.The first shipment of 50,000 doses from Sinovac is expected to arrive on February 20.

Its symptoms include headache, high fever and seizures.DOH Assistant Secretary Dr. Eric Tayag discouraged the public from taking JE vaccine shots during the rainy season, which is considered the disease’s peak season, citing the low probability of the vaccine taking effect when it is administered during the period.""Hindi ho namin nirerekomenda sapagkat sa panahon na kung saan tumataas po yung kaso, sayang lang po ang pagpapabakuna. Ginagawa po ang pagpapabakuna bago pa po ang tag-ulan (The vaccine should be administered before the rainy season),"" Tayag said.Tayag also cautioned medical practitioners who offer the JE vaccine, especially those who are taking advantage of the situation, to be mindful in administering the vaccine.""There is no known benefit of the vaccine when given during the peak season. Thus, the DOH cautions private practitioners not to offer JE vaccines during this period,” he said.Imojev, the only available brand of JE vaccine in the country, ranges from P2,500 to P4,000 per shot depending on the hospital where it is availed of.The said vaccine is now running out of stock in the market due to the sudden rise in demand following the series of reported death cases and rise in the number of patients in the past months.For DOH’s part, Tayag said the vaccine for JE will be included in the national immunization program in 2018 as soon as data confirms its efficacy. It will be introduced to young children during the off-peak season.Instead of the vaccine, Tayag said that the public must focus on maintaining cleanliness of their surroundings, including getting rid of standing water, to avoid becoming breeding places for mosquitoes.Wearing of long-sleeved tops, pants, or socks to avoid mosquito bites and use of mosquito nets and applying insect repellents approved by the Food and Drug Administration are also advised, he said.“When we get sick or our children develop fever for two days or flu-like symptoms, seek immediate consultation at the nearest health facilities.

This is the first EUA for a vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the Philippines.“After a thorough review of the currently available data by medical and regulatory experts, the FDA today is granting Emergency Use Authorization to Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine,” Domingo announced.“The interim data from the ongoing phase 3 trial shows that the vaccine has an efficacy of 95 percent in the study population and at least 92 percent among all racial groups,” he added.Domingo said all conditions for the issuance of an EUA were met. Their assessment also showed that the benefits of using the vaccine outweigh the known and potential risks of the product.He said recipients of the vaccine will be closely monitored given reports of severe allergic reactions in a few individuals out of the more than five million people worldwide who have been inoculated. It is also possible that more adverse effects will emerge.He said the vaccinations must be done by health professionals trained to recognize and manage adverse reactions. They should also have resources at hand to adequately respond.Reporting of the patient’s response to the vaccine shall be through the pharmacovigilance system that will be activated once the vaccination program is implemented, Domingo added.“The FDA commits to continue its job to ensure that Filipinos can have access to vaccines that hold greater benefits and outweigh the risk and possible adverse effects during this time of pandemic,” he said.An EUA allows the use of a vaccine or drug that is still under development to respond to a public health emergency such as the Covid-19 pandemic.Pfizer-BioNTech applied for an EUA in the Philippines on December 23, 2020. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union, Canada, Switzerland and Singapore have already issued an EUA for this vaccine.The Pfizer vaccine is the only candidate vaccine against Covid-19 that has been issued an Emergency Use Listing (EUL) by the World Health Organization (WHO).It is primarily aimed at preventing Covid-19 in individuals who are 16 years old and older. Prior to dilution, it has to be stored at -80 to -60 degrees Celsius.Other companies that have filed for EUA in the country are multinational pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, which submitted its application on January 6, and Gamaleya Research Institute of Russia, which applied on January 7.Sinovac Biotech of China filed its EUA application before the FDA Wednesday afternoon, January 13.As of Thursday morning, Domingo said the Vaccine Expert Panel reviewing the AstraZeneca Chadox1-S was scheduled to send within the day questions to clarify some clinical trial data.AstraZeneca has an EUA in the UK, Argentina and India. Domingo said the panel hope to make a recommendation as soon as AstraZeneca responds to the questions.Gamaleya has sent preliminary data on its Sputnik V candidate vaccine, but still has to submit some required documents. Sputnik V has an EUA in Russia, Argentina, Algeria, Bolivia, Serbia, Venezuela and Palestine.Sinovac’s CoronaVac Sars-CoV-2 vaccine is undergoing pre-assessment, Domingo said.The company has submitted the results of its phase 1 and 2 clinical trials. Domingo said they were awaiting data on its phase 3 trials.“Until we see the clinical trials phase 3 results, we couldn’t assess it,” he added.The Sinovac vaccine is expected to send its first shipment of 50,000 doses on February 20, followed by 950,000 doses in March, and two million to three million doses a month until December.In a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte Wednesday night, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said a shipment of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine through the WHO's Covax initiative may also arrive in February.

(VTI).The LTFRB 7 now resumes the bus operation in the Dumaguete City-Cebu City route after months of travel restrictions due to community quarantines imposed by the government to slow down the spread of Covid-19.However, Montealto said the bus operators' main problem is the lack of passengers. He learned that several residents of Dumaguete City were hesitant to travel to Cebu City as they knew they would be subjected to a mandatory quarantine when they returned.Montealto said the VTI is currently processing its application for special permits for at least 12 buses that are expected to resume operating in the Dumaguete City-Cebu City route.The number of buses can possibly go up, depending on the volume of commuters.The LTFRB 7 will be also monitoring transport companies to ensure that those issued with special permits to operate are servicing their routes.Montealto said the first batch of buses will possibly service the inter-province route in the middle of January 2021.Traditional jeepneysA total of 18 traditional public utility jeepneys have been issued special permits to operate within Mandaue City as of Tuesday, December 29.Eleven of these traditional jeeps travel within Mandaue City. Three units ply the Liloan-Mandaue City route.The routes Lapu-Lapu City-Mandaue City, Danao City-Mandaue City, Compostela-Mandaue City and Consolacion-Mandaue City are served with one unit each.In Cebu City, a total of 324 traditional jeepneys units were issued with special permits.Montealto said there is no limit now as to how many TPUJs are allowed to reoperate in Metro Cebu as long as these units are already under a consolidated corporation or a cooperative.He said the deadline for the consolidation was supposed to be on December 31, but it was extended to March 31, 2021.Montealto said he consulted the local officials if they will allow the LTFRB 7 to pull out the buses serving their localities as the traditional jeepneys have already augmented the public transport. But the local officials decided not to recall the buses as yet, Montealto said.In Cebu City alone, a total of 192 public utility buses are operating as of now.A total of 872 buses are plying the roads of Metro Cebu and Cebu Province, while 297 modern public utility jeepneys are transporting passengers in Cebu.

Concepcion III said around 1.5 million Filipinos will benefit from this agreement and half of them would be frontliners from the private sector.This is the first vaccine procurement deal signed in the Philippines, after President Rodrigo Duterte allowed the signing of advance market commitments (AMC).Shortly before the signing, however, Department of Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they have asked AstraZeneca to explain the alleged errors in the clinical trials for its vaccine candidate.She said they were expecting an official statement from the British pharmaceutical company.""We are waiting for the manufacturer because they have that responsibility,"" Vergeire said in a virtual press conference Friday.She said even the Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP) and the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) are waiting for AstraZeneca’s explanation.""That is also their request, that they get more information so that they can further study the implications of this,"" said Vergeire.Tripartite dealThe tripartite deal was signed among Concepcion, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines Inc. president Lotis Ramin and the donors.Teresita Sy-Coson, chairperson of BDO Unibank and BDO Foundation that initiated the donation, said in her message that the procurement deal is significant despite the skepticism over the vaccine.She said this will help protect frontliners in the short term and help the government reach its vaccination target in the medium term.The government targets to immunize 60 to 75 million Filipinos over the next three years to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19.Other private sector donors are Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, chairman and CEO of Ayala Corporation; Lance Gokongwei, CEO of JG Summit Holdings Corporation and chairman of Gokongwei Brothers Foundation; Ramon Ang, president and COO of San Miguel Corporation; Enrique Razon, chairman of International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICTSI); and Manuel Pangilinan, chairman of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation.Others that pitched in and attended the signing ceremony were the Lopez Group, Philippine National Bank, Philippine Franchise Association, LBC Express, Udenna Corporation, Aboitiz Corporation, AC Health, Penshoppe, Philippine TransMarine Carriers Group, GT Capital Holdings, Wilcon Depot, Magsaysay People Resource Corporation, Yazaki Torres Manufacturing, Filinvest Corporation and EastWest Bank, Jollibee Group, Double Dragon Properties and MerryMart, Mercury Drug Corporation, Seaoil Philippines, Concepcion Industrial Corporation, Bounty Agro Ventures Inc., Century Properties Group, and the Federation of Filipino Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry.The vaccines are expected to be delivered in May or June 2021. Each dose costs $5, the lowest price for a potential vaccine against Covid-19.Clinical trialsAstraZeneca has filed an application to conduct clinical trials for its vaccine candidate in the Philippines.Jaime Montoya, executive director of the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, said the Philippines is the only country in Southeast Asia being eyed by AstraZeneca for its clinical trials.He said they were waiting for AstraZeneca to submit their data on its clinical trials.“You know, we have no way of verifying it until they submit their official documents which we will have to verify based on the data they will present. As I understand it, they are presently evaluating and analyzing where the errors where and why these happened.He said, however, that he does not foresee any effect on the vaccine’s efficacy.“It’s just a question of numbers and the basis for such numbers,” he added.AstraZeneca earlier reported that the vaccine AZD1222 it is developing together with the University of Oxford is “highly effective” in preventing Covid-19 based on an interim analysis of clinical trials in the UK and Brazil.Researchers found that efficacy is higher when the vaccine is administered in one-and-a-half doses instead of the usual two doses.Reports alleged that this was established after a batch of volunteers were accidentally given only a half dose initially.AstraZeneca said the vaccine showed an efficacy of 90 percent when it was given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart.Efficacy was 62 percent when given as two full doses at least one month apart.The combined analysis from both dosing regimens resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent, the company added.No hospitalizations or severe cases of the disease were reported in the 131 participants in the clinical trials.

Its adherence, in fact, regard it as a universal religion, thereby reducing Christianity as simply another one of the dozens of sects,” Tulabing said.Freemasonry is known as the world's oldest fraternal organization and is known to encounter considerable opposition from the Catholic Church.He said they also disagree with the use of an obelisk, which is linked to ancient Egypt, where it is regarded as a sacred object.""An obelisk is a pagan structure,” Tulabing said.An obelisk is a tall, four-sided, narrow tapering monument with a pyramid-like top that represents the immortality of the pharaoh, while also meant to honor the sun god.According to Tulabing, the public initially learned that a “view deck” will be built on the said site.However, when the city government broke ground on November 27, it was learned that the construction will be an 18-floor masonic obelisk.The Dumaguete Cathedral Parish Pastoral Council has already asked the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) to intervene.The petition underscored the impacts of the project that the NHCP should consider, namely religious, cultural, and historical; legality; health and environment; peace and order; and the City’s decision to build without public consultation.

They thought Junjen was getting better until he suddenly contracted high-grade fever during the weekend. The fever lasted until Tuesday night, Junrey said.Junrey and his wife Jinny started to get anxious when Jujen had a nosebleed past midnight.ConfirmationJunrey admitted that he and his wife started to worry after hearing reports that the dengue vaccine being distributed in some parts of the country can cause severe dengue to those who have yet to contract the virus.“Nabalaka gyud mi kay gatoo lage mi nga makatabang ang bakuna sa among anak para dili na siya ma-dengue. Mas nigrabe naman noon (We thought the vaccine would help, but instead it made the matter worse),” Junrey said.Harby Abellanosa, TCDH chief nurse, confirmed that Jujen has dengue after they found that his platelet count was low during a complete blood count examination.Abellanosa told reporters that they referred Jujen to the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City since they don’t have an ICU at the TCDH.But his parents opted to bring their son to the South General Hospital in the City of Naga instead.Hours after her son was admitted, Jinny told SunStar Cebu that his condition has stabilized even though his platelet count is still very low.Following the incident, the Ababons’ neighbors in Sitio Kaduldulan have started to worry.Felsy Aleo said she now worries for her 15-year-old daughter who also received the dengue vaccine.Aleo said she and her husband decided to let her have the vaccine after one of their neighbors died of dengue fever last July.Mobilization“Sukad atong namatay ang among silingan, wala na mi nikompyansa (Ever since our neighbor died, we have not been complacent). Gipabakuna gyud namo among mga anak para dili sad sila matapdan.

They should not just inject anything, even with good condition. It should be tested, and tested all over again before it could be used on human beings,” Palma added.",sunstar

Their expectations are high.”Today, there is no need to educate the Dumaguete customer. He knows what he is eating, and what he wants.When it was time to move to a new location in Claytown, chef Claudine called in her favored architect who also designed the original Chantilly along Silliman Avenue to design a compact white-washed shabby chic interior.“Because the place was compact, I wanted to give the cake house a sense of lightness; the blank wall behind the counter, with open shelves and salvaged decorative shutter windows from the original store,” said architect Ned Carlos, creative director and principal architect of the Dumaguete City-based Carlos & Antique Architects.Custom-made chandeliers salvaged from glass bottles were hung, and reused Victorian-style chairs and tables were furnished to bring in the rustic yet feminine feel. The architect also wanted to bring in the outdoors by letting in natural light by day and a fresh feel at night.With a shabby chic interior prescribing to the Swiss ideology of desserts, Chantilly’s pretty and delightful cake creations are hearty slices in line with Filipino taste and ambience.“While Dumagueteños love their sweets, their exposure to international-quality desserts began with Chantilly,” said Carlos.Here, the architect’s work demonstrated the skillful use of practical decoration to dramatize Chantilly’s interior space.",sunstar

It is a flagship project of the Cinema Committee of the National Commission for the Culture and the Arts (NCCA).Being the festival director of the Mindanao Film Festival, a recipient of an NCCA grant, I was tasked to select some regional films from Davao to bring to Dumaguete.Among the films chosen was the 16th Mindanao Film Festival Best Film winner “Pulangui”, helmed by Bagane Fiola; “Siyudad sa Bulawan”, a film about child laborers in the gold mines of Mt. Diwalwal, by Jarell Serencio; “Walay Nidanguynguy” by Glorypeal Dy; a pair of shorts by filmmakers from the University of Mindanao; “Midnight Epiphany” by James Villegas; and “Kapitan Ele” by Dan Angelo Calderon.The 11th Cinema Rehiyon is hosted by Foundation University. The organizing team headed by Juliet Cuizon was able to mount the festival smoothly considering the large amount of logistics involved. The Film Development Council of the Philippines supported the event where they also held a Film Industry Conference for regional filmmakers.Talks on producing, film financing, and pitching were held to help regional filmmakers level up with their productions.Before the festival proper, film festival directors across the country underwent a film management workshop organized by the Film Development Council of the Philippines. Young Woo Kim, a film programmer from South Korea served as our workshop speaker.The highlight of the workshop held in the town of Sibulan in Negros Oriental was a meeting with FDCP chair Liza Diño Seguerra, where problems and issues of various film festivals were tackled.After the workshop from Sibulan we took a 20-minute ride to Dumaguete City for the festival. Screenings of films were held at the Foundation University, Silliman University, Negros Oriental State University and Robinsons Movieworld.There were about 100 films which were screened consisting of shorts and full-length features.I was able to watch “A History of a Few Bad Things” by Cebuano filmmaker Keith Deligero which stars 1990s Ang TV teen star Victor Neri as a police detective investigating a string of murders. Then there was Teng Mangansakan’s “Masla A Papanok”, which tells the story of a mythical bird in Cotabato and its appearance during the latter part of Spanish rule. I also got the chance to catch “Aria” by Kapampangan filmmaker Carlo Enciso Catu.“Aria” revolves around a woman guerrilla fighting the Japanese in Pampanga during World War II.The closing film of the festival was the 1966 film “Passionate Strangers”, parts of which were shot in Dumaguete City. It was made by the National Artist for film Eddie Romero who hails from Dumaguete.Aside from meeting filmmakers and film programmers, arts and culture officials, supporters and academicians, I was able to explore this lovely city facing the sea.Among the various attractions was the old Silliman University and its iconic campus of old buildings and acacia trees. Then there is the famed boulevard where one can watch folk performances while feasting on tempura peddled by ambulant vendors.I was able to visit Dauin, the birthplace of my paternal grandfather. The town is famed for its dive spots, particularly the world-famous Apo Island.",sunstar

VESTIL AND CHERRY ANN LIM,"November 15, 2017","TWO babies from Barangay Pajac, Lapu-Lapu City died last Saturday, three days after they were given different vaccines at the barangay health center.Last Nov. 8, the midwife injected Ghirvaughn Mcreign Limpangog, a three-month-old boy, with a pentavalent shot; and Ayesha Mae Suson, a four-month-old girl, with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).They suffered seizures and a fever soon after, prompting their families to blame the vaccines for their deaths.However, Lapu-Lapu City Health Officer Rodolfo Berame said the babies died from other causes.“That is fake news. Why fake news? Based on the death certificate, the girl died of acute gastoentiritis with severe dehydration, while the boy died of meningitis,” he said in Cebuano.Limpangog’s immediate cause of death was “status epilepticus.” “Meningitis” was written in the underlying cause section.In Suson’s case, her immediate cause of death was “electrolyte imbalance secondary to acute gastroenteritis with severe dehydration.” The other significant condition that contributed to her death was “pediatric community-acquired pneumonia high risk with hypoxia.”The two babies both died at 2:20 p.m. at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center last Nov. 11.Berame said that pentavalent vaccine has no history of serious side effects, which include fever and redness around the injected area.“I think the parents did not tell the truth probably because we do not give vaccines to children who have a fever or who are not feeling well because the vaccine is expensive at P4,000 per shot,” Berame said in Cebuano.Yesterday, Ariel Igoy, Limpangog’s grandfather, filed a complaint before the Department of Health (DOH) 7.Ariel wants the DOH to investigate the two deaths so these won’t happen to other children in their area.Whatever the result of the investigation, Ariel said, they will not file a case against the persons involved. He just wants to know what happened.“I just want the procedure to be corrected because another child might fall victim,” Ariel said in Cebuano.Gian Millicent Igoy, 20, Limpangog’s mother, said that her son might have received an overdose because he was given one vial of pentavalent.Limpangog, who used the last name of his father, was the second and youngest child of Gian. Gian has a three-year-old daughter.The Igoys wants a certified doctor or medical practitioner to vaccinate children in the future.Lynlyn Suson, mother of Ayesha Mae, also believes that the PCV killed her daughter.Lynlyn said they are willing to file a case against the person responsible.Pajac Barangay Captain Jimmy Ylanan, for his part, said that the person who vaccinated the children is an experienced midwife employed by the City Health Office.Ylanan also said the vaccines were not expired.Mayor Paz Radaza said that she will ask the city attorney to look into the matter.Meanwhile, the DOH 7, in a text message to SunStar Cebu, said that based on the diagnosis provided by the hospital where the two babies died, the symptoms they suffered are not side effects of the vaccines they received.So it’s still inconclusive to attribute their deaths to the vaccines, said DOH 7 Director Jaime Bernadas.He has ordered the Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit to investigate the incidents.Pentavalent vaccine is a combination of five vaccines intended to protect people from five potentially fatal diseases namely haemophilus influenza type B, which causes meningitis, pneumonia and otitis; whooping cough; tetanus; hepatitis B; and diphtheria.",sunstar

VESTIL,"December 29, 2018","MORE than a year after the Dengvaxia controversy was brought to light, more parents in Central Visayas are refusing to have their children vaccinated, resulting in outbreaks of preventable diseases, such as measles, in some parts of the region.According to the Department of Health (DOH) 7, as of Dec. 21, only 43 percent of children between the ages of six months and four years old were immunized under the National Immunization Program.The target was to vaccinate around 343,246 children this year.They cited, among others, the current controversy surrounding the Dengvaxia vaccine, as factors behind the low number of children vaccinated.Dr. Rene Catan, Cebu Provincial Health Office (PHO) head, said that since the controversy started, a lot of parents in Cebu refused to have their children vaccinated by local health workers. It was in November 2017 when DOH suspended the school-based dengue vaccination program when it was reported that some children died due to complications from the Dengvaxia vaccine.Catan said the Dengvaxia controversy fueled doubts on the efficacy of vaccines being offered by the National Government.“Because of this controversy, the DOH, and even local health offices, are being scrutinized by the public on how they have implemented their vaccination programs,” Catan told SunStar Cebu.Of the 162,000 children that were vaccinated with Dengvaxia in Central Visayas in 2017, 11 had died.But health officials have yet to provide conclusive data on whether the 11 deaths were truly attributed to Dengvaxia.Maria Lorraine Gimperoso, PHO Child Care nurse coordinator, said that from January to Dec. 1 this year, the PHO successfully administered anti-measles vaccines to 65,424 children in Cebu. But this was only 20 percent of its annual target of 327,121 children six months old and above.Catan said that due to the refusal of some parents to vaccinate their children, outbreaks of preventable diseases were prevalent this year.Based on the data provided by the DOH 7’s Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit (Resu), cases of measles from January to Dec. 15 rose to 419 cases with two deaths, which is 635 percent higher compared to the same period last year.Only 57 measles cases were monitored by the DOH from January to December 2017. There were no deaths.Dumaguete City had the most number of cases in Central Visayas with 47 monitored. Earlier this year, Dumaguete City and six towns in Negros Oriental experienced an outbreak of measles cases.In Central Visayas, Dumaguete City had the most number of measles cases with 47 monitored there. Cebu City ranked second with 38 cases.In terms of fatalities, two towns in Cebu recorded one death each: Tuburan and Tabogon.But Ruff Vincent Valdevieso, DOH 7 National Immunization Program nurse coordinator, said that not all of those who refused to have their children vaccinated were because of the Dengvaxia controversy. Some parents refused either because of ignorance or due to religious reasons.“There were others who allowed their children to be vaccinated if the procedure and the benefits of the vaccines were explained to them,” Valdevieso said in Cebuano.For Catan, it will be a big challenge for them to convince parents to avail themselves of vaccines for their children next year.",sunstar

He said he is looking into the purported ""hit list"" being circulated around.Cañete said one of the names in the ""hit list"" has already been killed.In the Senate inquiry, the supposed existence of a vigilante group had also surfaced, prompting an investigation as ordered by the Philippine National Police Chief General Oscar Albayalde.Cañete said there are two ""hit lists."" The first of which was circulated as early as last year by a group purportedly known as Kawsa Guihulnganon Batok Komunista (Kagubak).The results that Cañete released showed that of the 22 deaths being investigated by the CHR, only those involving the four police intelligence officers in the municipality of Ayungon and the two former rebels in Zamboanguita were allegedly possibly perpetrated by the NPA.The four policemen who were killed last July 18 in Sitio Yamot in Barangay Mabato, Ayungon were Corporal Relebert Beronio, Patrolman Roel Cabellon, Patrolman Marquino de Leon, and Patrolman Raffy Callao, while the rebel returnees who were shot dead last July 24 in Poblacion Zamboanguita were Weny Alegre and Felimeno Januan.The CHR-Negros Oriental preliminary investigations noted that the killings of Canlaon City Councilor Ramon Jalandoni; barangay captain Ernesto Posadas of Barangay Panubigan, Canlaon City; former Ayungon mayor Edcel Enardecido; and barangay captain Romeo Alipan of Barangay Buenavista, Guihulngan City have three things in common.First is that the marks on their doors are consistent to be those of a battering ram; second, the same description of the number of perpetrators of about 20 to 30; and, the same description of vehicles used, e.g., cars and vans.Jalandoni, Posadas, and Enardecido were shot dead on the same date, July 27, while Alipan was killed on July 25.The CHR initial observations also noted the time element of the Jalandoni, Posadas, and Enardecido murders, committed at 12:05 a.m., 12:20 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. of the same date.Jalandoni and Posadas were both inside their houses in the same barangay in Panubigan, Canlaon City, same with Enardecido, whose house in Ayungon was about 86 kilometers from Canlaon City.Other observations were also noted via video footage taken from a closed circuit television (CCTV) camera in the Jalandoni compound.On the deaths of lawyer Anthony Trinidad last July 23 and the Bayawa siblings, Arthur and Ardale, last July 25 in Guihulngan City, the CHR findings showed one thing in common: a land dispute between the Bayawas and the informal settlers, a case that the late siblings, represented by Trinidad, had won in court.Alipan, meanwhile, was one of those mentioned in a letter of supposed targets for allegedly supporting the NPA, the CHR-Negros Oriental said.On the killing of Marlon Ocampo and his one-year-old son Marjun, who were shot dead inside their house in Barangay San Jose, Sta. Catalina last July 25, the possible motive could be a land dispute, contrary to earlier reports that it was perpetrated by the NPA.As to the murder of Federico Sabejon last July 27 in Poblacion, Siaton, the CHR said ""he had a hand in organizing new claimants in a landholding in Siaton which had long been settled by the DAR (Department of Agrarian Reform).""""It was the same landholding where individuals were allegedly shot to death by the alleged guards. The case is still pending in court,"" it added.The rest of the cases, according to Cañete, need to be further investigated and ""also to be determined if these fall under common crimes.""These include the deaths of Lito Itao in Barangay Buenavista, Guihulngan City last July 27; Barangay captain Sunny Caldera of Mabato, Ayungon on July 22; Raklin Asturias in Maloh, Siaton, last July 25; Reden Eleuterio in Tampocon, Ayungon, last July 27; and Ananciano Rosalita in Panubigan, Canlaon City, last July 28.The deaths of the 22 people being investigated by the CHR were reported from June 27 to July 28.

The program was, however, stopped recently after Dengvaxia maker Sanofi Pasteur announced possible risk if the drug is administered to individuals not previously infected with dengue.Even though Western Visayas was not included, the DOH regional office still included in its surveillance the monitoring of possible patients, who may had received the vaccine through private clinics.""As of now, we have not received any report of patients claiming that they were given Dengvaxia in private clinics or schools in those three recipient-regions,"" Reyes said.Still, the DOH urged the public to immediately seek medical help if they are experiencing symptoms of the deadly virus.""Not vaccinated by Dengvaxia should not be an excuse from submitting themselves to medication,"" Reyes said, adding most dengue victims die due to failure to seek early treatment.Investigation on the Dengvaxia fiasco is now rolling. Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said the government may file corresponding cases against Sanofi Pasteur.These charges are on top of the lawsuit, which can be filed by the parents of children found to have been affected by the anti-dengue vaccine, he said.Public health experts insisted that the government has the moral obligation to the families affected by the incident which they call the ""biggest public scam.""""The government, through PhilHealth, will be willing to shoulder the medical expenses of possible patients,"" Roque said.Recipients of the vaccine will only have dengue if they have not acquired the virus prior to the immunization, the government official said.",sunstar

We have active immunization which we give to those distant lang ang bite from the brain and takes effect after two to three weeks, kay hinay man ang travel ana sa virus and the passive immunization which takes effect immediately. Para na sa near sa brain ang wound,” Dr. Bongcas said.CHO data showed that the increase in animal bite and human rabies cases doubled.In 2013, the first quarter recorded 1,300 cases and 2,400 in the second quarter; while this year, the first quarter increased to 2,539 cases and the second quarter at 2,755 cases.Among those cases in this year, 2,212 patients were vaccinated under category 2 and 264 in the category 3 in the first quarter; while in the second quarter, 2,492 were vaccinated in the category 2 and 261 in the category 3.However, Bongcas stressed that it would be better to get the animals vaccinated rather than humans coming to CHO for vaccination.Zero-rabies country“It is possible to attain a zero-rabies country; however, this will require us to get all of our pets vaccinated. We need to promote responsible pet ownership. And the community needs to cooperate with us so that dili sayang ang mga campaign. Ayaw pag palit ug iro or any pet kung dili ka kabalo mo-pakaon or mo-atiman. Having a pet requires responsibility, time and attention on the owner’s part,” she added.The rising rabies cases are allegedly contributed to households adopting dogs just for the sake of acquiring a pet, it being a new fad especially among teenagers.Health officials do not discourage getting pets, but remind the public to get pets only if ready for the responsibility it entails.“Naa naman tay free vaccination karon sa City Vet, which several barangays have been tapped kay para didto na magpa-vaccine ang mga iro. Since mas barato ang pagpa-vaccine sa animals, it would be better to have your pets vaccinated kaysa sa human ang i-vaccinate nga dako kaayo ka og gasto especially kung severe na kaayo ang case sa patient,” Bongcas furthered.The CHO warns the public to be wary of stray dogs that may have symptoms of rabies, since the city does not have a dog pound yet and is still looking for an area to create a dog pound.In the Philippines, most number of rabies cases comes from dogs.Wash the biteWhen bitten by a suspected rabies-infected animal, patients are advised to wash the wound with soap and water and immediately consult a doctor for treatment and vaccination.The Department of Health recorded around 200 to 300 death cases due to rabies in the country each year.",sunstar

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/409627/Lifestyle/Dengvaxia-dilemma-making-conspiracy-theories-real,Dengvaxia dilemma: making conspiracy theories real,NEF LUCZON,"December 13, 2017","THE World Health Organization (WHO) has categorically acknowledged that vaccines and immunizations are necessary, and in a way promotes world governments to ensure the safety of the general population to have access of these for free, given that these shots have been approved from a stringent process made by this United Nations agency.Among these vaccines being encouraged by WHO, are those specializing in dengue. In fact the 67th session of WHO’s Regional Office for the Western Pacific was held in Manila on October 10-14, 2016, and has planned to endorse the “Western Pacific Regional Action Plan for Dengue Prevention and Control (RAP, 2016).”The new RAP is a response following the results manifesting that the dengue problem continues to increase, despite the Regional Committee has endorsed in 2008 the “Dengue Strategic Plan for the Asia Pacific Region (2008–2015).” The strategic plan was supposed to serve as a roadmap for dengue prevention and control efforts in the Western Pacific Region, which includes the Philippines.“Although progress has been made, an incomplete understanding of the disease and limited tools and resources have frustrated efforts to control dengue,” according to the regional committee’s statement in its introductory to the RAP documents. In addition, the new RAP is also a way to comply with “The Global Strategy for Dengue Prevention and Control 2012–2020” that aims to reduce 50 percent in mortality and 25 percent in morbidity due to dengue by 2020, and we have three years left to achieve that.The Department of Health (DoH), regardless of who was its secretary and sitting as president of the Philippines, must have acknowledged WHO’s regional committee’s strategic plan for dengue from 2008-2015. As the agency should be working with WHO as far as the health of the population is concerned, especially dengue as one of the prevalent diseases reoccurring whole year round.At the end of the regional committee’s strategic plan’s target year of 2015, DoH data showed that from January 1 to December 31, 2015, a total of 200,415 “suspect” dengue cases were reported nationwide, which has an alarming rate of 64.8 percent higher compared to the same period last 2014 which was around 121,580. The high number of cases come from Region 3 (17.9 percent), Region 4-A (16.8 percent), National Capital Region (NCR, 12.6 percent), and Region 2 (7 percent).Meanwhile, the DoH did not upload in its online database the full 2016 data and it has stopped on “Week 36” or from January 1 to September 10, 2016. But the figures had a total of 126,386 suspect dengue cases reported nationwide, which was 14 percent higher compared in the previous year. At this period in time, Region 6 (12.7 percent) got the highest incident of dengue cases, followed by Region 4-A (10.4 percent), Region 7 (10.3 percent), Region 12 (8.6 percent), and Region 3 (8.1%).And here comes Dengvaxia, an anti-dengue vaccine produced by a French pharmaceutical company, Sanofi Pasteur. The vaccine was reportedly approved by the DoH’s Food and Drug Administration in December 2015, and given the data mentioned earlier especially the year, it was highly coincidental.The scandal started when DoH entered a rather rushed contract with Sanofi Pasteuer, and rolled out these vaccines especially in public schools, despite the fact that the vaccine was in its development stage and the WHO did not even recommend it for immediate dispensation. And when this came out to the public and currently investigated at the Senate, more than 800,000 - mostly school children - have already been vaccinated, some were reportedly to have died. Those who get the vaccines also come from the regions with high cases of dengue in 2015 and 2016 especially Region 3, 4, and NCR.This is only the medical and scientific side of it. What is more alarming is the long-term effects of the public on trusting DoH programs and letting their children get vaccinated or immunized. In Western countries, there have been groups or organizations that do not subscribe to the idea of getting their children vaccinated, they are named the Anti-Vaxxers.Anti-Vaxxers believed that vaccines and immunizations give more harm to people than protecting them from diseases, adding more suspicions was the great conspiracy theory on big pharmaceutical companies controlling the world by creating diseases in order to sell governments vaccines and other medicines to stop these “man-made diseases.”The Dengvaxia scandal did not only put DoH to a great shame in protecting the people it serves, but it has incited distrust to the public, in the long run, some may not believe anymore to any of the agency’s projects and would become skeptical to the point of becoming Anti-Vaxxers themselves.Prevention of dengue and other tropical diseases prevalent in the Philippines is at par important as getting people vaccinated and immunized with clinically tested vaccines that has passed the rigid screening process from national governments to the WHO. Being part member of the United Nations, the Philippines are obliged to meet the targets set by the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), and on this case: SDG Number 3: Good and Health and Well-Being. The WHO Regional Committee’s RAP 2016 also seeks to address that some SDGs are being met in the process of combatting dengue and other mosquito-borne diseases.If the Philippines is serious in eradicating dengue, it should not be influenced by politics, and it should not shortchange its service to the people over personal gains of money and junkets traveling abroad. And then again, the greatest challenge for DoH now is how to win the public back their trust.*****(nefluczon@gmail.com)",sunstar

Its members are Luis Salvador, Precious Legayada, Anna Nicole Cuachon, Bea Galupo, and Jason Acebuque, with mentor Dr. Calvin de los Reyes.The team was named grand champion at the Ideas Positive National Youth Forum for Public Health (IPNYFPH) 2017, which was held on August 12 at the Bayanihan Center in Pasig City.IPNYFPH 2017 is the culmination of Ideas Positive Run 7, the youth engagement program of Unilab Foundation. Ideas Positive empowers the youth to build a healthier Philippines. Since 2010, the program has engaged more than 36,000 youth, transformed 172 communities, and reached 1.5 million Filipinos.Grand championThe team's ""Project Bakunanays"" aimed for 100 percent compliance to School-Based Immunization (SBI) among 70 first-grade students of Ungka II Elementary School in Pavia, Iloilo, with a view to decreasing “the morbidity and mortality of school-aged children due to vaccine-preventable diseases.”“We chose to focus on immunization because we believe that it is an investment for future generations,” said Salvador. “We must secure our future by ensuring that the children are able to get the necessary shots to keep them from diseases.”An immersion trip to the community revealed Pavia students had significantly low compliance to school-based immunization, especially in Ungka II Elementary School. The team’s research showed that parents were wary of immunization, because of many misconceptions regarding vaccination, as well as the students' own fears.Project BakunanaysTo address these problems, they created a group of volunteers called the ImmuniTeam Core Group.The ImmuniTeam helped facilitate the project in the school. Its members also held seminars called Wastong BakUNAWA sessions, where students, parents, and local healthcare providers learned about the booster vaccines (Measles Rubella and Tetanus-Diphtheria).The seminars also provided an opportunity to debunk misconceptions about vaccination, and to suggest ways to make the vaccination sessions more comfortable and less daunting for the children.At the core of the project is the construction of an ImmuniStation.“The ImmuniStation is not just a cart that dispenses vaccines, but it also contains manuals that includes all the necessary information and materials needed to implement Project Bakunanays in a community,” said Salvador.Afterwards, the team scheduled play sessions with the kids to alleviate the fears of vaccination. The children were educated through games, songs, and even an especially-produced story book.The story book told the story of Baki Bakuna, who did not want to get vaccinated because of his fear of needles. When Baki Bakuna found out what diseases he might get, he eventually agreed to be vaccinated.The team also produced pamphlets and different educational materials to increase awareness about vaccination, specifically about the advantages of booster vaccines.100% complianceAfter implementing the project, Team BakUNAWA achieved 100 percent compliance at Ungka II. But they didn’t stop there. They brought the project to Pal-agon Amparo Elementary School, which ranked second in vaccination refusal rates in Pavia, Iloilo. There, they also met with 100 percent approval from the parents for the incoming vaccination.Through Project Bakunanays, the team was able to bring together students and teachers, families, and different organizations into one community that advocates for better health through school-based immunizations.Among their partners were Barangay Ungka II, Pavia, Philippine Pediatric Society-Western Visayas Chapter, Department of Health-Western Visayas, and Department of Education-Division of Iloilo.Salvador called on the youth to implement their powerful ideas. “Young minds are full of positive ideas. Our capacity to make a positive change is not limited by our age. Nothing beats a young person with a positive idea and the heart and perseverance to turn that idea into reality!”Ideas Positive Run 8 will start accepting entries in September 2017.For more information about Ideas Positive, contact Regina Layug-Rosero at regina.layug.rosero@unilabfoundation.org or visit www.unilabfoundation.org.

Guiao Convention Center here.It contains the identification of vaccinated school children including their name, grade level, gender and name and contact number of the holder’s parents, as well as the number of doses and the date they received each dose of Dengvaxia vaccine.DOH Undersecretary Leonita Gorgolon said that the ID system was launched to aid in the tracking down of individuals who would be inflicted by severe dengue or other possible adverse effects after receiving the vaccine.In case the beneficiaries will experience fever or other symptoms of dengue, the ID must be presented to health facilities to serve as a guide on the proper response that must be given to patients.“May mga issue kasi na iyong mga mother ay nagpupunta sa ospital and claims na that their children ay vaccinated by Dengvaxia when they are not.

I don’t think this can help in the peace process that is being started by the President,” Obar pointed out.“I hope the police will look at the light of day because this is not good for them,” he added.Sestoso died a day after he was shot by two motorcycle-riding suspects, with the police claiming afterward that the New People's Army (NPA) was behind the killing.Bustamante asked the police to produce the alleged suspects, a certain “Sherwin” and “Mokong”, who are in a better position to point to him as the source of information, his lawyer said.Obar was, however, told “Sherwin”, whose real name is Jerryl Delantes, is now fighting for his life after a shooting incident on Saturday in La Libertad, Negros Oriental.In that incident, his driver, a certain Richard Bustamante alias “Dondon”, was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital.“They have to produce any or both of them because I want to cross-examine the sources; they cannot just bring charges and not present the sources of information,” the defense lawyer said.""If the police fail to produce the principal suspects by participation, “I don’t think the case will even prosper at the level of the prosecutor's office,” Obar said.If the information of Senior Superintendent Raul Tacaca, Negros Oriental provincial police director, is correct that the late Richard Bustamante was the triggerman in the shooting of Sestoso, and not “Mokong” or “Sherwin”, then there seems something wrong with the story of the police, he added.“It has become more complicated for the police,” Obar said.

(PNA),,"January 17, 2020","DUMAGUETE CITY – Bishop Julito Cortes of the Diocese of Dumaguete is appealing to the lay faithful here to offer prayers, especially the Oratio Imperata, and extend financial assistance to the victims of the Taal Volcano eruption.In an interview on January 15, he said the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) had prepared the special prayer for such purpose.The Oratio Imperata is an obligatory prayer of invocation that a local ordinary or prelate authorizes for grave concerns, such as calamities.Bishop Cortes said the Oratio Imperata for the Taal Volcano eruption shall be prayed in the different parishes in the Diocese of Dumaguete.The prayer invokes the Lord’s protection for those in harm’s way, to keep “safe and free from harm and danger all of us but most especially, the sick and disabled, the poor and the helpless, the children and those who are alone with no one to care for them.”It also seeks to “stir up in us the spirit of compassion, charity, and mercy towards our vulnerable, suffering and weak brothers and sisters.”Cortes also asked the faithful to help the people of Batangas affected by the volcanic eruption by sharing some of their financial resources through the diocese, such as during the second collection in certain masses, which will be announced later.He said the diocese would no longer accept relief goods, such as used clothing and foodstuff unlike in the past, as it would be easier, faster, and more convenient to send financial assistance instead to the evacuees.On the recent natural disasters around the world, the prelate said, “For me, (this) is the call of nature to us to take care of the environment.”“The four elements – earth, air, water, fire – are already calling us, for our attention because of the neglect and abuse of the environment and now, they are coming back to us,” he said.In the face of climate change, his appeal to the people is that “number one, we should pray for the victims of these natural calamities; second, to find it in our hearts to help them in whatever way we can; and thirdly, we should be grateful and thank the Lord that right now we are spared from this although we have had our share of natural calamities in the past.”“We should continue to be mindful now of our actions that they are not destructive of the environment because what we do to creation, we do to ourselves,” Cortes said.

The Philippine response has been swift and sharp.The Department of Health (DOH) suspended its school-based dengue vaccination program, while its Food and Drugs Administration ordered Sanofi last week to pull the vaccine from the market. The Senate began an inquiry. And the secretary of health, Dr. Francisco Duque III, said that Government would demand from Sanofi a refund of the P3.5 billion paid for the vaccine.Before we yield to any fears that the “anti-vaxxers” among us might encourage, let’s consider what Sanofi actually announced. “For individuals who have not been previously infected by dengue virus, vaccination should not be recommended,” it said last Nov. 29 on its website.That caution is not new. As early as July 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) pointed out that the dengue vaccine “may be ineffective or may theoretically even increase the future risk of hospitalized or severe dengue illness in those who are seronegative at the time of first vaccination, regardless of age.” In other words, persons who have not been bitten before by the mosquito that harbors the dengue virus do not need the dengue vaccine.While the DOH is right to be cautious and to air its grievances about Dengvaxia, Secretary Duque is also right in saying that the dengue vaccination program will proceed, but with better safeguards. DOH can help allay parents’ fears by providing more facts. How many, of the 832,000 vaccinated since April 2016, have contracted severe dengue fever? What steps has DOH taken to ensure that WHO guidelines, especially on deciding which communities should receive the vaccine, were followed?In its position paper on dengue vaccination, WHO recommended distributing the vaccine only in areas where at least 70 percent of the target age group already tested positive for dengue fever. It also recommended that children younger than nine years old be excluded from the vaccination program, after it studied the results of clinical trials in 10,275 persons, ages 2 to 14 years old, in 10 Asian and Latin American countries.At no point did the WHO recommend axing the use of vaccines to prevent dengue fever, which has struck an estimated 50 million each year “in recent years, predominantly in Asia.” Narrowing the target groups for dengue vaccination is cautious and rightly so, but keeping the dengue vaccine away from the truly vulnerable communities’ reach would be reckless.",sunstar

WENCESLAO,"December 14, 2017","WHEN I first wrote about the Dengvaxia issue days ago, I suggested that we wait for additional information to flow before commenting on it. That I think was the best way to go considering the polarized setup the country is in now. Issues get politicized notably by traditional politicians (trapos) who are now in power. Health is such a sensitive issue its handling should not be left to trapos alone.Sanofi Pasteur, the manufacturer of the anti-dengue vaccine that the government bought for P3.5 billion, had announced earlier that persons vaccinated with Dengvaxia could develop a severe case of dengue if they have not been infected with the illness before and subsequently get an infection. The Department of Health (DOH) had by then vaccinated more than 700,000 people mostly students.The reaction, notably by politicians and some so-called health experts who are Dengvaxia critics, was swift. With only that single news item, they went around town engaging in the blame game and in the process scaring the public. Since the usual suspects as far as the current administration is concerned is the previous administration, politicians pounced on former president Noynoy Aquino and the DOH secretary in his time, Janette Garin. So-called health experts joined the blame game by shouting in chorus, “we told you so!”Among the amusing reactions: pro-Duterte bloggers accusing the Aquino administration of committing “genocide” as if they knew the meaning of the term. Then you have Sen. Richard Gordon who pounced on the issue after weeks of silence when Sen. Antonio Trillanes IV accused him of plunder in the use of Red Cross funds. Following reports of Aquino and Garin meeting with Sanofi Pasteur officials, Gordon came up with insinuations about “conspiracy” and obviously, corruption.It got to the point wherein the feeling that those vaccinated would be falling or dying one by one was fostered. Truly, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, more so if that knowledge is being used to advance political goals.Days after, the noise has died down and, with more information, it has gotten clear that the Dengvaxia is not as worse as some sectors would want us to believe. One, Dengvaxia does not cause dengue, the virus does. Two, the risk of “severe” infection in people previously uninfected with dengue and given the vaccine and then got infected is only about two in 1,000 and they recovered with treatment. Three, Dengvaxia remains effective as a vaccine for those previously infected with dengue and were vaccinated.Interestingly, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee chaired by Gordon opened its hearings on the Dengvaxia issue yesterday with no less than Aquino attending as a “resource person.” Earlier, he said one of his purposes in going to the hearing was to answer insinuations, among them by Gordon, being thrown at him (the insinuation, if we are to be frank about it, is that Aquino got commission from the deal). There was no hesitation in Aquino’s answer and Gordon had to backtrack after staring at the truth in the face.The Dengvaxia issue has once again shown us what is wrong with our politics.",sunstar

The second phase involves over 100 but less than 1,000 participants. A larger group is needed for the third phase.Participants should be “completely voluntary.” They will first be screened and will be briefed about the trial and the vaccines and will undergo physical examination and review of health history.They will be divided into two groups. One group will receive the vaccine while the other will receive the placebo, or fake vaccine.Torres said the three companies are looking for healthy adult volunteers who are 18 years and above, including senior citizens.Pregnant women are not allowed to participate in the trials.Participants should be aware of the necessary protocols of the trial and should be advised to keep a diary card where they will jot down the symptoms and other health observations following the vaccination.They would be given schedules for follow-up check-up and they will be monitored for a maximum of 18 months.Montoya said the conduct of the independent clinical trials should still adhere to the protocols of the FDA which includes insurance to the participants for any eventualities.He said despite undergoing trial vaccination, participants should still follow health protocols to avoid contracting the virus.

Thousands of children were given the vaccine.Juanico noted that following the Dengvaxia scare, the number of children who took vaccines for measles, pneumonia and meningitis has decreased.With this, Juanico said that to properly raise awareness and eradicate the stigma, they encouraged health workers to help conduct orientations to change the public's mindset.The health office also launched video advertisements to inform the people about the importance of vaccines.Juanico said they took the Dengvaxia controversy as a challenge for them to further promote the importance of immunization.She said in August, they will again conduct school-based immunization in all schools in Iloilo.They will also offer a weekly Iron Folic Acid Supplementation and Deworming services to the children, she said.

So why haven’t we signed a deal with any of the vaccine manufacturers until now?It is false to assert that we are not in any worse position than the other local government units in the race to acquire the vaccine. The cities of Bacolod, Quezon, Davao, Baguio, Manila and Iloilo and a few smaller cities, among others, have already signed tripartite and non-disclosure agreements with the national government and AstraZeneca. Some may have already made advance payments as authorized by President Duterte.But at least we’re moving now. Last week, the council met with representatives of two vaccine manufacturers. A few days later, they authorized Mayor Edgar Labella to negotiate the acquisition of P200 million worth of vaccines. The quantity is not enough to immunize the city’s nearly one million population or at least that portion that would enhance herd immunity, but it’s a good start. Even one shot is better than none at all.Maybe, city officials are counting on the national government to provide the balance. Indeed, why spend for something that you can obtain free? The P200 million savings can be re-programmed for other services.Not everyone will take the vaccine anyway. There are many of them who have probably been influenced by all the disinformation being peddled in the Internet or traumatized by our experience with Dengvaxia or have not outgrown their fear of injection, which is unfortunate.In a column she wrote for the Washington Post yesterday, American book author, CNN analyst and former Baltimore Health Commissioner Leana Wen cited the need for health authorities to fully explain the significance of vaccination. Is it a free pass to travel? Can they revert to their old lifestyles, no more wearing of masks and no more physical distancing?So far, Dr. Wen said, what has been made clear is that starting 14 days, after a person has received his second dose of the vaccine, he does not have to quarantine anymore even if he was exposed to someone with Covid-19.“After all, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness and nearly 100 percent at preventing severe disease. These are astounding results,” Dr. Wen, who was born in Shanghai, China, said, “and essentially mean that Covid-19 in a vaccinated person is no worse than a bad cold or a flu.”Compare that to the situation of the unvaccinated. He runs the risk of becoming seriously ill and even dying from Covid-19. If he’s working, he cannot transmit the disease to his co-employees who have been vaccinated but may get the coronavirus from the latter since “the research is not definitive on whether vaccinated people can transmit Covid-19,” according to Dr. Wen.To be vaccinated or not to be vaccinated, that is the question.

These are expected to arrive in the country in the second half of 2021.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said each LGU will pay for the vaccine and reimburse AstraZeneca for all costs associated with delivery, distribution, storage and destruction of the vaccines prior to delivery to the destination port.The LGUs are also mandated to develop and implement a local vaccination plan that is aligned with the national deployment and vaccination plan.Each local plan should follow the geographical and sectoral priority list in the national plan, Roque added.The vaccines being procured by the LGUs are on top of the 2.6 million doses that private corporations are donating to the government. Half of these will be administered to private sector executives and employees.Each dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine costs $5, the lowest price among the candidate vaccines in the market. It is administered in two doses.The AstraZeneca vaccine was developed in partnership with the University of Oxford.Based on interim analysis of clinical trials in the United Kingdom and Brazil, it has been found to be 90 percent effective against Covid-19 when given as a half dose, followed by a full dose at least one month apart.It is only 62 percent effective when given as two full doses at least one month apart, resulting in an average efficacy of 70 percent from both dosing regimens.AstraZeneca has a pending application with the Food and Drug Administration for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to allow its use in the Philippines.Aside from AstraZeneca, Novavax through the Serum Institute of India and Sinovac Biotech Ltd. of China will also supply Covid-19 vaccines to the Philippines.The government has signed an agreement for the purchase of 30 million doses of Novavax vaccines, which are expected in July 2021.Sinovac will start shipping vaccines to the country in February, with an initial 50,000 doses, followed by 950,000 doses in March, and two million to three million doses monthly until December 2021.

Gwendolyn Garcia as among those who allegedly ""pressured"" her into continuing and expanding the vaccination program.Another former Health secretary, Janette Garin, was quick to belie Ubial's claims.Garin, who is in the hot seat because of the controversial program that was initiated when she was Health secretary, said her husband Oscar is not a member of the CA and could not have influenced the commission's decision to reject Ubial.""For the record, Oscar Garin Jr is my husband. He is not a member of the CA,"" Garin said.She pointed out that her husband was merely pushing for the administration of the subsequent doses of the vaccine, given that the first dose has been administered to about 800,000 public school children.""Sino po ba kami para impluwensyahan ang CA (Who are we to influence the CA)? It's an independent body,"" Garin said.She said it is but natural for lawmakers to fight for benefits for their constituents, as what her husband and Garcia of Cebu were doing.""Hindi po yan pressure, hindi po pinilit, at wala kaming kinalaman sa Commission on Appointments (That is not pressure. That was not forced and we don't have anything to do with the Commission on Appointments),"" Garin added.During the hearing for the Department of Health's 2018 budget, Ubial said Garcia ""repeatedly badgered"" her to expand the program to Central Visayas, or Region 7. Central Visayas covers Cebu, Bohol, Negros Oriental and Siquijor.""There was a particular time in the budget hearing that it took us one hour of exchanges - of questions, badgering me, trying to make me commit to expand the vaccination program to Region 7. (They said) that they will defer the DOH budget if I will not do that,"" Ubial said.Senator Richard Gordon, chairman of the Senate blue ribbon committee, remarked that Garcia sounded like she was just pushing for the vaccination program to benefit her constituents.""That doesn't sound like pressure, but a congresswoman fighting for her constituency,"" Gordon said.The DOH suspended the dengue vaccination program on December 1, in light of new findings by pharmaceutical firm Sanofi Pasteur that its Dengvaxia vaccine may cause severe dengue among those who have not had dengue fever prior to immunization.The World Health Organization, in an advisory on November 30, said the vaccine may be administered only to seropositive individuals, or those who have contracted the dengue virus prior to immunization.Dengvaxia is the world's first licensed vaccine for dengue, a deadly mosquito-borne disease.

It is being eyed as a pilot site for the rollout of the vaccines.Its vaccination plan is divided into three stages, namely, pre-vaccination, vaccination and post-vaccination.The pre-vaccination phase includes the identification of their 16 vaccination sites, accounting of vaccine recipients depending on their prioritization, creation of vaccination teams and preparation of the vaccinees.Monitoring of the vaccinees is part of the post-vaccination phase.Pasig City aims to vaccinate over 33,000 people per week.Valenzuela CityValenzuela City conducted its dry run on Tuesday, January 26, simulating the transport of vaccines from the cold storage facility to designated vaccination areas.Valenzuela City Mayor Rex Gatchalian said the process before the actual vaccination, which includes the assessment of the vaccine, will take only 15 minutes but the recipient should stay for at least 30 to 45 minutes more as part of protocol to monitor any adverse reactions.Based on the guidelines issued by the DOH, persons who are vaccinated should be given a card indicating the vaccine received, the date of inoculation and the schedule for the administration of the second dose.Gatchalian said their vaccination teams can inoculate at least 3,000 people per day.Valenzuela City has signed an agreement to secure 640,000 doses of vaccines from AstraZeneca for 70 percent of its population.The remaining 30 percent will receive the vaccines provided by the national government.Taguig CityTaguig City on Wednesday, January 27, conducted a vaccination dry run at the Taguig City Vaccination Hub in Lakeshore Mega Complex.Taguig City Mayor Lino Cayetano said they have prepared five mega vaccination centers and over 40 community vaccination centers, which will include private and public schools, and hospitals.Cold storage facilities have also been identified.Cayetano said their vaccination strategy starts with social preparation through a public health information campaign.Taguig City has a population of nearly 1.03 million. Around 670,000 are eligible to be vaccinated.The first batch will be vaccinated from February to March 2021, while the second batch will be from April to December 2021. All individuals are required to acquire a Taguig Citizens ID, which will serve as a pre-registration for vaccination.The city committed on January 5 to allocate P1 billion for the vaccines to ensure that all residents would be inoculated for free.Taguig is among the first cities to open a drive through Covid-19 testing facility. It has one of the lowest numbers of active cases in Metro Manila, with only five cases per 100,000 residents.The Department of the Interior and Local Government earlier said free vaccines will be released to the LGUs only upon the approval of a vaccination plan.The plan should include information dissemination in order to encourage the people to get vaccinated, draw up a list of recipients, create a vaccination team and have the team undergo training by the DOH.Garcia said members of the National Task Force Against Covid-19 will visit LGUs in Metro Manila to check on their preparations and plans for the vaccine rollout.He said the government will also focus on the vaccination campaign in Cebu and Davao cities, where cases of coronavirus infection are rising.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said Sinovac Biotech of China will make its initial delivery of 50,000 doses on February 20/Galvez said the target is to procure 148 million doses this year. So far, the government has secured 25 million doses from Sinovac, 30 million from Novavax and 17 million from AstraZeneca.Negotiations are ongoing with Pfizer, Janssen, Gamaleya and Bharat BioTech.

1,762,994 frontline health workers in both public and private hospitals, and barangay health workers;
3,789,874 indigent senior citizens;
5,678,544 remaining senior citizens;
12,911,193 indigent population; and
525,523 uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), Philippine National Police (PNP), Philippine Coast Guard, Bureau of Fire Protection and Cafgu.
Next in line, or Group B, are the teachers; social workers; government workers; essential workers outside health, education, social welfare sectors including agriculture, food industry, transportation, tourism, manufacturing and construction, among others; special groups such as persons deprived of liberty, persons with disability and those living in high density areas; overseas Filipino workers and other remaining workforce.They comprise 10.15 percent of the Filipinos.After everyone on this priority list is inoculated, the rest of the Philippines’ 109.58 million population will receive the vaccine. This would be Group C.Cabotaje assured that all Filipinos will be vaccinated. For 2021, the target is to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos.“Lahat mababakunahan, may mauuna nga lamang (Everyone will be vaccinated, some people ahead of others),” she said in a virtual press conference on Tuesday, January 27, 2021.DOH, however, has stressed that vaccination is not mandatory. The vaccine will be administered only on those who sign a final consent form.The priority sectors and areas for the deployment of vaccines were identified in the three-year National Deployment and Vaccination Plan, which was approved by the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Infectious Diseases on January 21.The plan was adopted for implementation by the National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 on January 26, less than a month before the expected arrival of the first shipments of Covid-19 vaccines.DeploymentUnder the plan, the vaccines will be deployed by phases depending on the time of delivery, available doses and logistical requirements.Since the delivery of vaccines to the country would be in tranches, deployment would be based on the number of active cases of infection per region and the attack rate per 100,000 in the recent four weeks.As of January, the country’s 17 regions are prioritized as follows:
National Capital Region
Calabarzon (IV-A)
Central Luzon (III)
Central Visayas (VII)
Ilocos (I)
Western Visayas (VI)
Bicol (V)
Davao (XI)
Northern Mindanao (X)
Zamboanga Peninsula (IX)
Soccsksargen (XII)
Eastern Visayas (VIII)
Cagayan Valley (II)
Bangsamoro Autonomous Region
Mimaropa (IV-B)
Caraga Administrative Region
Cordillera Administrative Region
This priority list will be reviewed monthly and recalibrated based on the active cases and attack rates.Local government units have been directed to draw up their own vaccination plans aligned with the national plan.As of January 31, the cities of Manila, Taguig, Pasig, Valenzuela, San Juan, Muntinlupa, Mandaluyong, Quezon and Iloilo, and the municipality of Carmona in Cavite have completed their local plans.Cold storageThree major cold storage hubs for the vaccines have been initially identified.The cold storage facility of United Laboratories Inc. (Unilab) in Biñan City in Laguna can store around five million doses of vaccine at a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.Zuellig Pharma Corporation in Parañaque City, Metro Manila can store up to 6.5 million doses at ultra-low temperatures of -80 degrees Celsius. Its walk-in freezers, capable of temperatures ranging from -50 to -25 degrees Celsius, can hold 40 million doses. Its cold rooms, with temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius, can store up to 629 million doses.The Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila has committed its storage facility with a temperature of as low as -80 degrees Celsius. It also has four cold rooms at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius and one -20 degrees Celsius walk-in freezer.Prior to the arrival of the vaccines, the LGUs should prepare the master list of the eligible vaccinees to determine the number of doses that should be delivered to an area.The deadline for the master list for Group A was on January 31. Patient profile and consent for the frontline health services under Group A should be completed by February 15.The master list for Groups A and B should be completed by March 31 while the master list for Group C should be done by June 30.Vaccination sitesVaccination sites should be identified a few weeks or days prior to the arrival of the vaccines.The plan recommends the following as vaccination sites: rooms in health facilities such as conference rooms, auditoriums, theaters and gymnasiums.If these are not available, tents or temporary buildings may be put up in parking lots and open spaces.A vaccination site must be spacious enough to allow physical distancing and must have several sanitation areas.It must have a waiting area, a vaccination area that can accommodate at least three vaccination teams and three AEFI (adverse event following immunization) composite teams, and a post-vaccination monitoring area.The LGU must also identify the vaccination processes and teams prior to the delivery of the vaccines.A vaccination team should have six members:
2 physician/nurse/midwife for screening and assessment;
1 health educator (volunteer teacher, social worker, medical student);
1 vaccinator (physician/nurse/midwife); and
2 documenters and vital signs taker (midwife/barangay health worker/ health staff or volunteer teacher, social worker, medical student).
An AEFI composite team will have two members: a paramedic/nurse/midwife to monitor and provide response; and surveillance officer/nurse/midwife/pharmacist to conduct surveillance.There should be a vaccination team supervisor, preferably a physician, for every three vaccination teams as well as a supervisor for the implementing unit and a supervisor for the entire LGU.Other personnel needed in the implementing unit are cold chain and logistics officers, barangay captains, security personnel (police), drivers and safety officers (barangay tanods).In community or health facilities, the barangay health worker (BHW) and hospital staff will serve as social mobilizers while BHWs and local officials will oversee transport.Under the plan, the national government aims to engage other professionals to become part of the vaccination workforce.Vaccination processEligible vaccinees will be required to register, after which they will be provided with a vaccination date and time schedule, as well as an immunization card with a QR code that should be presented at the vaccination post.Walk-in persons will be told to follow the process since vaccines would be enough for those scheduled for the day.After a temperature check at the waiting area, each vaccinee shall be assigned to a specific vaccination team.The immunization card with QR code must be presented for scanning at the registration area and the vaccinee must present a government ID.He or she will then be directed to the health education area, where he or she will be given information on the vaccine. The vaccinee will then be asked to sign the Final Consent form.The vaccinee will undergo physical examination at the screening area before he or she can proceed to the vaccination area.After inoculation, the QR code will be scanned and the vaccination details (date of vaccination, vaccine manufacturer, batch number, lot number, name of vaccinator and signature) will be recorded on the immunization card.“Since karaniwan double dose ang vaccine sa immunization card, ilalagay kung ano ang vaccine na tinanggap ng isang vaccine dahil ‘yun din ang tatanggapin niyang second dose,” said Cabotaje.(The name of the vaccine must be indicated in the immunization card because the same vaccine must be used for the second dose.)She said there will be no allergy test prior to the vaccination.""As a routine we have never been testing for (allergies). We just rely on the patient's health history based on investigation during the pre- registration and registration itself,"" said Cabotaje.MonitoringVaccinees will be monitored for 30 minutes to one hour after inoculation for any adverse reactions.Cabotaje said first aid will be given to patients experiencing adverse effects before they will be referred to a hospital, if further management is needed.The government will activate an incident command system, which will monitor all vaccination-related concerns.She said they were also looking at setting up a vaccination tracker to determine the number of people who have been vaccinated and monitor the volume of vaccines deployed.In general, Cabotaje said there will be no need for an RT-PCR test prior to vaccination.However, she said the DOH will issue specific guidelines on the vaccines based on information submitted by the manufacturers to the Food and Drug Administration.""What is being recommended for Pfizer-BioNTech is, if you have a history of positive Covid based on RT-PCR, you defer the vaccination for 90 days, but this is still being studied if it is applicable with the Filipinos,"" she added.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1884753/Manila/Local-News/Special-report-Building-vaccine-confidence,Special report: Building vaccine confidence,MARITES VILLAMOR-ILANO,"February 03, 2021","(This is the conclusion of the SunStar Philippines special report on efforts to defeat the Covid-19 pandemic through vaccination.)TWO recent surveys indicated that Filipinos have yet to overcome vaccine hesitancy arising from the Dengvaxia controversy.More than four out of 10, or 44.1 percent, of the 15,651 participants in the University of Santo Tomas Covid-19 vaccine awareness team survey either hesitated or said they will not / probably not get the vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).The survey was conducted from January 16 to 30, 2021 on several social media platforms. No reasons were given for their refusal to receive the vaccine.Six out of 10, or 55.9 percent, said yes / probably yes. Almost half of the respondents, or 45.7 percent, said they prefer the vaccines made in the United States (US) or Europe while 50.9 percent said they will use any safe and effective vaccine.A Pulse Asia survey conducted among 2,400 respondents from November 23 to December 2, 2020 also showed that nearly half, or 47 percent, said they will not get the vaccine.Nearly a third, or 32 percent, said they will get vaccinated while one in five, or 21 percent, were unsure.The results were worse in the Visayas and Mindanao, where 55 percent and 48 percent, respectively, said no.In terms of income classifications, 43 percent of class ABC, 46 percent of class D and 56 percent of class E said no.Concerns over the safety of the vaccine were cited as reason for refusal or hesitancy by more than eight of 10, or 84 percent, of the respondents.Vaccine hesitancy, or the delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines, has been blamed for the low immunization rates in the country since the Department of Health (DOH) suspended its dengue vaccination program.The program was suspended on December 1, 2017 after vaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur revealed new findings that its anti-dengue product, Dengvaxia, poses greater risk of severe dengue fever to those who have not been previously infected with the virus.This led to the filing of cases against DOH officials, who were blamed for deaths believed to have been caused by Dengvaxia. Former DOH secretary Janette Garin and nine others were indicted for reckless imprudence.In 2019, DOH blamed vaccine hesitancy for the measles outbreak. Measles is a vaccine-preventable disease.In the first quarter of 2020, full immunization coverage in children hit a record low of 7.0 percent, less than a third of the quarterly target of 23 to 24 percent and about half of the 16 percent average pre-Covid-19 accomplishment.This was, however, also due to the pandemic-related lockdown.Fully aware of the challenges in the implementation of a vaccination program against Covid-19, the government has launched a massive information campaign.Transparency is keyDOH Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje, in a virtual learning session for the media on January 29, 2021, said transparency is the key factor in encouraging Filipinos to receive the vaccine against Covid-19.She asked that those who receive the vaccine first “spread the word” and help build public trust in vaccines.WHO consultant Suzanne Brownlow Kerba, in the same session, said health workers should be aware of possible side effects and explain these well to the public.She said the public may confuse these side effects with Covid-19 or flu symptoms and may worry that the vaccine gave them Covid-19.Kerba said health workers should emphasize to the patients that side effects indicate a good immune response, and are temporary.It is important that vaccine recipients return for the second dose even if they experience unpleasant side effects after the first dose, she added.She said adverse effects could include allergies to a component of the vaccine, quality defects in the vaccine, and human errors.The keys to effective communication are honesty, empathy, respect, humility, resolve and partnership.“We come back down to trust because if the people are not trusting what the DOH is saying, what the media is saying, we are in a quandary so those groups have to provide trust,” she said.Behavioral approachDr. Elisse Nicole Catalan, who has a master’s degree in public health from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said anxiety about the vaccine can be attributed to fear of the unknown, misinformation and distrust.She said the government's knee-jerk reaction to provide information without a behavioral approach is inadequate.“There needs to be a careful consideration of how people will consume the information and this same message should cleverly also act as a tool to assist in an individual’s decision-making process,” she said.She suggested the use of the “nudge theory”, or the behavioral economics concept of libertarian paternalism, to influence the public’s decision while respecting their freedom of choice.“How can this be done? People need to be shown that the direct result of their vaccination will benefit their communities, and contribute to attaining herd immunity that will allow us to go about our lives like we did in 2019 (e.g. mask-less, no lockdowns),” she said.“People need to know that if they refuse to be vaccinated, cases will continue to rise, bringing about the threat of a bigger outbreak that can result in more variants and mutations,” she added.Catalan also said the government needs to show exactly how the vaccination program will be conducted, and that it will be easy, accessible, and safe.“People need to know how the vaccinations will be conducted and what to expect. Will it be available in every barangay or district hospital?” she said.The government has drawn up a national deployment and vaccination plan, a detailed action plan to carry out the vaccination program over the next three years. Local government units (LGUs) have also been directed to localize this plan.Read: Special report: Government prepares for vaccine rolloutVaccine confidenceCatalan said the government can promote vaccine confidence by asking prominent figures, celebrities and athletes to help in the campaign.She noted that several first world leaders have come forward and were vaccinated publicly.In Indonesia, social media influencers were vaccinated and asked to spread the word about the vaccine.Several other countries encouraged vaccine recipients to share their personal experiences about the process.Catalan also said there should be a dedicated resource to address queries about possible reactions after inoculation and a clear plan on what one needs to do if he/she feels unwell after the jab.Under the deployment and vaccination plan, an incident command system will be established to monitor all vaccination-related concerns.Vaccine recipients will be monitored for 30 minutes to one hour after inoculation for any adverse reactions. If they experience adverse reactions after they’re cleared, they are to immediately inform a doctor or a barangay health worker, or go to a hospital.The government has adopted VigiFlow, a management system for recording, processing and sharing reports of adverse effects, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual press conference on January 27.Trainings have also been conducted to capacitate healthcare workers and alert them to any adverse events.Vaccine operations centers have been established in all regional offices and town hall meetings to increase vaccine awareness were being conducted, Vergeire added.Catalan said there needs to be a multi-sectoral effort to encourage all citizens to get vaccinated.Both the public and private sectors must target communications to different segments of the population, and recognize the need to communicate in all major languages and dialects in the country.She suggested that telecommunications companies be asked to provide reminders and factoids via text messages and e-commerce apps display nudges to the public while people online shop.“This pandemic is one war we all need to win together. We have no choice but to fully commit and go all in. This virus has crippled our lives and livelihood for a year and counting. We can’t afford a moment more,” she added.

We remain committed to making our vaccine available on every continent to help end this global pandemic,” she added.About the vaccineThe Covid-19 Vaccine Moderna (referred to in the U.S. as the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine) is an mRNA vaccine against Covid-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center.The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing. It was shipped to the NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection.The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing.On May 12, the U.S Food and Drug Administration granted the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine Fast Track designation.On May 29, the first participants in each age cohort: adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300) were dosed in the Phase 2 study of the vaccine. On July 8, the Phase 2 study completed enrolment.Results from the second interim analysis of the NIH-led Phase 1 study of the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine in the 56-70 and 71+ age groups were published on September 29 in The New England Journal of Medicine.On July 28, results from a non-human primate preclinical viral challenge study evaluating the vaccine were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.On July 14, an interim analysis of the original cohorts in the NIH-led Phase 1 study of the vaccine was published in The New England Journal of Medicine.On November 30, Moderna announced the primary efficacy analysis of the Phase 3 study of the vaccine conducted on 196 cases.On December 3, a letter to the editor was published in The New England Journal of Medicine reporting that participants in the Phase 1 study of the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine retained high levels of neutralizing antibodies through 119 days following first vaccination (90 days following second vaccination).The Covid-19 Vaccine Moderna has been granted temporary approval by Swissmedic, the Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, based upon the recommendation of the Human Medicines Expert Committee (HMEC), which authorizes the Covid-19 Vaccine Moderna for active immunization to prevent Covid-19 caused by Sars-CoV-2 virus in individuals 18 years of age and older.

BUNYE,"February 22, 2021","FOR two consecutive weeks, Muntinlupa City held virtual town hall meetings to drum up high participation in its forthcoming Covid vaccination program. Invited to the separate meetings with the theme ""Bakunado, Protektado"" were representatives of homeowners groups, religious groups, civic groups, Sangguniang Kabataan, the Gender Development Office and the City Administrator's Office.During the first meeting held February 10, the resource speakers were Infection Prevention and Control for Committee Chair Charissa Borja-Tabora of Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and Jesusa Joyce Cirunay of the Food and Drug Administration. Ms. Borja-Tabora underscored the safety of vaccines, the process of clinical trials, and the role of vaccines in protecting individuals and communities. Ms. Cirunay discussed the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization and the stringent process and policies for the approval of vaccines.During the second meeting held last Thursday, Dr. Jose Mari Castro of the Department of Health shared his insights on the nature of Covid-19, means of transmission and safeguards to protect oneself and the community.A special feature of both town hall meetings was an AVP specially prepared by the Public Information Office, headed by Tez V. Navarro, explaining the need to have oneself vaccinated. The AVP also answered frequently asked questions regarding the safety of FDA-approved vaccines.In a February 11 Covid survey involving 17,561 respondents from Muntinlupa's nine barangays, 4,484 respondents or 24 percent indicated they were not willing to be vaccinated. The most common reasons cited were fear of side effects, doubts about the efficiency rate of the vaccine and cost of vaccination, exacerbated obviously by conflicting information circulating in social media.Dr. Teresa ""Tet"" Tuliao, Muntinlupa City CHO, is targeting 383,000 or 70 percent of the entire city population -- the minimum number for Muntinlupeños to be able to gain ""herd immunity.""Dr. Tuliao said the city has identified 6,758 medical frontliners from barangay health centers, emergency responders, the Ospital ng Muntinlupa and six private hospitals, including Asian Hospital, who can inject the vaccines. They will be organized into 82 vaccinations teams and deployed in 35 vaccination posts. They have the capability of vaccinating 8,200 individuals per day.Muntinlupa City will give priority to front-liners such as health workers and uniformed personnel. Next in line are indigent senior citizens, followed by other senior citizens.Vaccination during Spanish timesAt various periods during the Spanish era, the Philippines was hit by smallpox, bubonic plague, and cholera and it was interesting how the authorities dealt with them.In the 1800s, smallpox infected most of the Spanish territories, in South America and the Philippines. According to historian Ambeth Ocampo, the then reigning Spanish monarch, Carlos IV, ordered a vaccination expedition to head for the territories in 1803. The group was headed by Francisco Javier de Balmis.In the late 1700s, Spain already had a vaccine for smallpox and in fact Carlos IV had his immediate family inoculated. But the problem was how to transport the vaccine because of the long voyage involved. Balmis came up with the novel idea of using live carriers. From Spain to Mexico and from Mexico to Manila, Balmis used orphans working a relay system. During the voyage, Balmis transmitted the vaccine in sequence, from child to child, arm to arm, along the way to their destination.To cut a long story short, Balmis and his boys eventually reached Manila in 1805. The Spanish Governor-General Rafael Aguilar immediately had his own children inoculated. This softened the initial resistance of Bishop Domingo Collantes, the Archbishop of Manila, who was not keen on vaccination. Eventually, Balmis inoculated 20,000 inhabitants in Manila and environs. Balmis' assistants later proceeded to Misamis and Zamboanga. From Manila, Balmis brought Filipino orphans to Macau and Canton for a similar inoculation exercise.A bronze monument of Carlos IV, in front of the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, and a historical marker at the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine commemorate the Balmis vaccination expedition.Note: You may wish to share the foregoing article via Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.",sunstar

The product (has) been prepared, so we just need to finalize the procedures for the customs and we can choose the date for the flight,” Yang said from her office in Hong Kong.“We will try our best to see whether we can deliver the products this week or next week. It will be very soon,” she added.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in the same press briefing that President Rodrigo Duterte wants to witness the arrival of the vaccines.“Alam mo, Pilipino tayo. Tumatanaw tayo ng utang na loob. Sa ating panahon ng pangangailangan, eh talaga namang ‘yung kaibigan nating Tsina ang nagpadala ng unang bakuna sa atin,” Roque said.(We are Filipinos. We acknowledge a debt of gratitude to those who help us in times of need. Our friend China is the first to send vaccines to us.)“Barring any glitches, nais pong sumalubong nga ni Presidente (the President wants to be there when the vaccines arrive),” he added.Delivery of the first Sinovac vaccine shipment, which Malacañang said was supposed to happen on February 23, was delayed because of the lack of an emergency use authorization.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an EUA for the Sinovac vaccine only on Monday, February 23. An EUA allows the use of a vaccine under development during a public health emergency.Yang said it would have been futile to deliver the vaccines if these could not be used due to the absence of an EUA.CoronaVacThe vaccine, called CoronaVac, is an inactivated vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech subsidiary Sinovac Life Sciences Co. Ltd. in China. This contains Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, that has been killed so that it can’t make the recipient sick but can trigger an immune response.In granting the EUA, the FDA said the vaccine will be administered in two doses at 0.5 ml each four weeks apart to clinically healthy individuals 18 to 59 years old.It is not recommended for healthcare workers who are exposed to Covid-19 patients because the clinical trials in Brazil that involved healthcare workers dealing directly with Covid-19 patients showed an efficacy rate of only 50.38 percent against the disease.The vaccine, however, 100-percent prevented hospitalization and showed an efficacy of 78 percent among volunteers with mild to severe symptoms, Yang said.In Turkey, phase 2 clinical trials among healthy adults showed an efficacy of 91.5 percent.Indonesia earlier announced that its clinical trial for Sinovac among ordinary citizens yielded an efficacy rate of 65.3 percent. Indonesia issued an EUA for Sinovac on January 11, 2021.Clinical trials for the use of Sinovac vaccine among individuals who are 60 years old and above are still ongoing.“The inactivated vaccine has already proved (to be) very safe,” Yang said.As of Wednesday, she said the vaccine has been administered on over 20 million people, both in China and outside of China.Twelve countries have already received the Sinovac vaccine, including Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Colombia.The number will increase to 15 by the end of this week, Yang said.Common symptoms from the Sinovac vaccine are pain at the injection point, headache and fatigue. There has been no reports of deaths related to the vaccine, Yang added. (Marites Villamor-Ilano / SunStar Philippines)",sunstar

No problem,” Duque said in a television interview.“I will take it as long as it has undergone scientific evaluation by the Department of Science and Technology’s Vaccine Experts Panel, the Ethics Board Review and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) which will conduct its own regulatory assessment,"" he added.Duque made the statement in response to the challenge made by Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go that Duque and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. be the first to try the vaccine before it is administered to others.Duque also encouraged his fellow Cabinet members to volunteer and receive the vaccine first.Duque said the Covid vaccination program might start in March or April 2021.""We’ve done some scenario analysis under the leadership of Sec. (Carlito Jr) Galvez and I think the best case scenario would be about the end of the first quarter of 2021 or about the start of second quarter of next year,"" he said.""A lot of factors will have to be taken into consideration to be able to more definitively set schedules for actual distribution, deployment, and inoculation of our people within our priority list,"" he added.The Philippines has received five applications for clinical trials for vaccines against Covid-19.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. outlined the ambitious targets the government had for its vaccine program: secure at least 148 million vaccine doses and inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos within 2021. This month is crucial as the first doses of the vaccine are slated to arrive by end of February. February is also the month that the government signs on supply deals with the vaccine pharmaceutical companies.The question is, if the supply comes and you are eligible to get it from your local government unit, will you take the vaccine?Some people are coming from the fear of Dengvaxia and would like to wait and see the side effects of the vaccines, so I want to share with you real experiences from Filipinos who had the vaccine ahead of the Philippine population.One of those Filipinos who has had the vaccine is Binibinang Pilipinas Universe Tisha Silang. Former TV host and celebrity Tisha now lives in Toronto, Canada. Tisha works in the hospital with patients involved with work in physiotherapy and occupational therapy. She does work that is likened to a rehabilitation therapist. As she is working in Canada, her vaccine was free and provided by the government because she works in health care.The dose that she got was from the company Pfizer. Tisha experienced a slightly sore arm the day after vaccination, but it was gone within a day. She is scheduled to get the second dose on February 28, which is based on the Pfizer recommendations to receive a second dose 21 days after the first dose.I further asked if she is experiencing symptoms after the vaccination that people should be aware of. Luckily, she answered, ""I’m feeling great, back to normal, no different than prior to getting the vaccine."" She further adds, ""because the vaccine doesn’t reach its maximum effectivity of 95 percent until about a week after you have had your second dose, we are still asked to follow safety protocols of wearing masks, keeping 6-feet apart, proper handwashing, and of course, [wearing] full PPE (personal protective equipment] when we think we might be working with patients who might be Covid-positive. Also, because they have little to no research on the effect of the vaccine on pregnant women, they review these risks with you prior to consenting to have the vaccine if you think you could be or planning on pregnancy.""I have read in some articles that pregnant women are discouraged to take the vaccine. However, since Covid and the vaccines are so new, there are not enough studies to prove this theory.It is back to normal for Tisha as she was not asked to avoid any particular food or activities. Let us hope that everything will work out with her second dose as well.In the meantime, this beauty is working and living and still taking precautions as these precautions like wearing a mask and handwashing are now commonplace. This is the new normal and we just have to get used to it.***Follow me on Instagram @MissheidingFollow me on Twitter @Missheiding",sunstar

However, clinical trials in Brazil showed an efficacy rate of only 50.38 percent among healthcare workers who deal directly with Covid-19 patients.Vaccinations, which will be purely voluntary on the part of the recipients, are scheduled to kick off Monday, March 1, according to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.Based on the government's prioritization framework, medical frontliners will get first priority, followed by the armed forces, for whom the donation was made by China.The National Immunization Technical Advisory Group earlier said medical frontliners from 34 hospitals, including the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City and the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, will have the right of first refusal. The 32 other hospitals are in Metro Manila.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, who was also at the Villamor Air Base, described the shipment as the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel.“Ang eroplanong ‘yan ay hindi lang eroplano ngayon. ‘Yan po ay pag-asa at ‘yan po ang liwanag sa napakadilim na paglalakbay natin... na yugto ng ating kasaysayan.

As of today, there is no definite plan for the roll-out of vaccines in the Philippines. It is good to know though that several of our Filipino frontliners abroad have already gotten their dose.Lloyd is one of them. He works in an acute care hospital and he does rotation to different wards such as the Covid unit, palliative care, oncology departments, Neuroscience, orthopedic and trauma departments. With his role in the hospital, he was a candidate for the vaccine provided for by the government of Canada. He got it for free and did not need to have health or private insurance to receive it.The one that he was jabbed with was the Pfizer/Bio Ntech vaccine. He just got soreness on the inoculated site and a slight headache, which were typical symptoms he gets when he gets his annual flu shot.He took two doses, the second dose was administered to him 21 days after the first dose. According to Lloyd, he felt entirely normal, with no unusual changes in his body. Even after the vaccine, he still has to follow the guidelines from the provincial health orders because he said he can still be a carrier of the virus and can still pass it on to someone. Getting the vaccine for him did not require any changes to his diet or activity. It was just like getting a flu shot.I feel that the series I will run regarding Covid vaccines and real people who have taken the vaccine will put some people at ease that this vaccine is our chance if we ever want to get back to normal life.

The country’s 1.7 million healthcare workers need a total of 3.4 million doses.With the arrival of the AZ shipment, which consists of 487,200 doses, the Philippines has received a total of 1.087 million doses.The AZ vaccine is the second to reach the Philippines after the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine donated by China, which arrived on February 28.It is the first batch of the 4.7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines that the Philippines is programmed to receive under the first round of Covax allocations.A list of the allocations released on March 2 by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which co-leads Covax, showed that the Philippines was allocated a total of 4.584 million doses of the AZ vaccine and 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.The Philippines is among the 92 low and middle income economies that are eligible to participate in the Covax advance market commitment (AMC) mechanism. Higher income countries that have signed up with the Covax facility are self-financing participants.Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, explained that the Covax AMC is largely funded through official development assistance (ODA) as well as contributions from the private sector and philanthropists.“Even so, it is likely that the 92 ODA-eligible countries accessing vaccines through the Covax AMC may also be required to share some of the costs of Covid-19 vaccines and delivery,” Berkley said.Delivery of the vaccines to AMC participants depend on submission of “national regulatory requirements” as well as “availability of supply and fulfillment of other criteria such as validated national deployment and vaccination plans from AMC participants, indemnification and liability agreements, and export and import authorizations.”DeliveriesOther Southeast Asian countries that have received Covax vaccines as of March 4 are South Korea and Cambodia.South Korea, as a self-financing participant in the Covax facility, received 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on February 26, while Cambodia, which is also eligible for the Covax AMC like the Philippines, received 324,000 doses of the AZ vaccine on March 2.Covax managing director Aurelia Nguyen, in a Twitter post on March 3, said over 10 million doses have been delivered to 15 countries in just over a week.“This is a momentous milestone on the long journey to equitable vaccine access and the deliveries have only just begun,” she stated.Covax kicked off its global vaccine rollout on February 24 with a shipment to Ghana, the first outside India, where the AZ vaccines are manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII).The countries that received Covax vaccines ahead of the Philippines are Ghana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Nigeria, Angola, Cambodia, South Korea, Colombia, Rwanda, Gambia, Cote d’Ivoire, India, Sudan and Senegal.A total of 237 million doses of AZ vaccine and 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine constitute the first round of Covax allocations for 142 countries, which are either self-financing or AMC participants.Delivery of these vaccines has been scheduled for February to May 2021, according to the list released by Gavi.Unicef Philippines, in a social media post Thursday, March 4, said the goal of the Covax facility is to deliver at least 1.3 billion doses to the 92 eligible economies, including the Philippines, this year.The AZ vaccine is allowed for emergency use in the Philippines as the Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) on January 28, 2021.Other EUAs were granted for the Pfizer vaccine on January 14 and Sinovac vaccine on February 22.The Philippines kicked off its vaccination program against Covid-19 on March 1, a day after the Sinovac vaccines arrived.

Nograles said Sinovac has promised to deliver the vaccines in three to five days from the issuance of the EUA.Malacañang also earlier announced that an initial shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine was expected before the end of February.Covax had committed 92.9 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Philippines, but the target is to deliver these within the first half of 2021.

The safety data has also been critically assessed by the government’s independent advisory body, the Commission on Human Medicines,” Raine said.“No vaccine would be approved unless it meets these stringent standards – on that you can be sure,” she added.She said they have convened an Expert Group of the Commission on Human Medicines’ (CHM) to review the reports on anaphylaxis and consider any possible mitigation on the risk of anaphylaxis.Raine also assured that a safety monitoring strategy has been put in place to allow rapid, real-time safety monitoring at population level.The strategy works as indicated by the immediate reports on allergic reactions, she said.Vaccine recipients are monitored for 15 minutes after inoculation, with a longer observation period when indicated after clinical assessment.

The Philippines has asked for access to three to five million doses, but Galvez said they were looking at seeking access to up to 10 million doses.The Vaccine Panel of Experts has also submitted to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases the names of five more vaccine candidates from the United States for consideration.Galvez said the vaccine roadmap is aimed at accelerating the deployment of the vaccines as soon as these are available.“Ibig sabihin po nito, mas mapapabilis na natin ang proseso ng pag-angkat ng bakuna, ngunit alam din po natin na hindi ito magiging madali kaya puspusan po ang ating ginagawang paghahanda kasama po ng ating DOH,” Galvez said.(This will allow us to expedite the importation of vaccines. But we know this is not going to be easy which is why we are making preparations together with the DOH.)Galvez said the most critical stage is the beginning phase, which involves scientific evaluation and selection of the vaccines. Lead agencies for this phase are the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and DOH.Stage 2 involves access and acquisition. This will be led by the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and Department of Finance (DOF).Stage 3 is the procurement process while stage 4 will focus on organized and safe production, shipment and storage of vaccines.Lead agency for these phases are the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) and the TaskGroup Resource Management and Logistics.Both agencies are tasked to ensure that the acquisition and development of a vaccine are cost-effective and time-efficient.The same agencies will be in charge of the distribution and deployment of the vaccines under the fifth stage.Implementation of the vaccination plan nationwide will comprise stage 6 and will be a collaboration among the DOH, national and local government agencies, and local government unitsStage 7 is the assessment, evaluation and monitoring of the program to be led by the DOH, DOST and the University of the Philippines National Institutes of Health (UP-NIH).In his regular press conference, Roque said the government is on track in the implementation of the vaccination plan.Aside from the crafting and approval of the roadmap, the government has also organized and activated the National Task Group on Covid-19 Vaccination and Vaccine Panel of Experts.Based on its timetable, the following should also be completed within November and December 2020: selection and procurement of vaccine; start of clinical trials; forging of bilateral and multilateral engagements and arrangements; and completion of an immunization logistics and services support plan.Within the first quarter of 2021, or January to March, the procurement process as well as production, shipment and storage of the vaccines should have been completed.The rollout plan for the vaccine nationwide should also be completed within the period.Foremost of the considerations in selecting the vaccine is its safety and efficacy, Roque said.Bilateral agreements are being eyed with China, Russia, United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, India, Israel, Singapore, Germany and other Asean countries.Possible tripartite agreements are as follows: Philippines-UK-business sector; government-government-vaccine manufacturer; Philippines-vaccine company-business sector; Philippines-Indonesia-vaccine company; and Philippines-United States-vaccine company.Pooled procurement through the Asean as well as a multilateral agreement among the Philippines, Asian Development Bank, World Bank, World Health Organization and Unicef were also being looked at, Roque added.While waiting for the vaccine, Roque reiterated the need to comply with minimum health protocols such as wearing of face mask and face shield, frequent washing of hands and physical distancing.

But I want to emphasize the need for an even greater global effort to achieve enough vaccine supply to meet the needs of priority populations everywhere,” said Dr Mariângela Simão, WHO assistant director general for Access to Medicines and Health Products.“WHO and our partners are working night and day to evaluate other vaccines that have reached safety and efficacy standards. We encourage even more developers to come forward for review and assessment. It’s vitally important that we secure the critical supply needed to serve all countries around the world and stem the pandemic,” she added.Regulatory experts convened by WHO from around the world and WHO’s own teams reviewed the data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine’s safety, efficacy and quality as part of a risk-versus-benefit analysis.The review found that the vaccine met the must-have criteria for safety and efficacy set out by WHO, and that the benefits of using the vaccine to address Covid-19 offset potential risks.The vaccine is also under policy review. WHO’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) will convene on January 5, 2021, to formulate vaccine specific policies and recommendations for this product’s use in populations, drawing from the SAGE population prioritization recommendations for Covid-19 vaccines in general, issued in September 2020.The Comirnaty vaccine requires storage using an ultra-cold chain. It needs to be stored at -60°C to -90°C degrees.This requirement makes the vaccine more challenging to deploy in settings where ultra-cold chain equipment may not be available or reliably accessible.For that reason, WHO is working to support countries in assessing their delivery plans and preparing for use where possible.How the emergency use listing worksThe emergency use listing (EUL) procedure assesses the suitability of novel health products during public health emergencies.The objective is to make medicines, vaccines and diagnostics available as rapidly as possible to address the emergency while adhering to stringent criteria of safety, efficacy and quality.The assessment weighs the threat posed by the emergency as well as the benefit that would accrue from the use of the product against any potential risks.The EUL pathway involves a rigorous assessment of late phase II and phase III clinical trial data as well as substantial additional data on safety, efficacy, quality and a risk management plan.These data are reviewed by independent experts and WHO teams who consider the current body of evidence on the vaccine under consideration, the plans for monitoring its use, and plans for further studies.Experts from individual national authorities are invited to participate in the EUL review. Once a vaccine has been listed for WHO emergency use, WHO engages its regional regulatory networks and partners to inform national health authorities on the vaccine and its anticipated benefits based on data from clinical studies to date.In addition to the global, regional, and country regulatory procedures for emergency use, each country undertakes a policy process to decide whether and in whom to use the vaccine, with prioritization specified for the earliest use.Countries also undertake a vaccine readiness assessment which informs the vaccine deployment and introduction plan for the implementation of the vaccine under the EUL.As part of the EUL process, the company producing the vaccine must commit to continue to generate data to enable full licensure and WHO prequalification of the vaccine.The WHO prequalification process will assess additional clinical data generated from vaccine trials and deployment on a rolling basis to ensure the vaccine meets the necessary standards of quality, safety and efficacy for broader availability.

There's no such thing that I did not act quick enough,” he said in a television interview.“When you go through a process, you cannot just be hurrying up things just like that. You have to be prudent and cautious especially because you are talking about a novel vaccine,” he added.Duque made the statement amid allegations that he failed to work on the necessary documentary requirement, particularly the Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA) vital for the procurement of the vaccines from Pfizer.It was Senator Panfilo Lacson who revealed this, saying he had a meeting with Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez, who arranged the meeting between US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. in which they discussed the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines.""Thus, they could have secured the delivery of 10 million Pfizer vaccines as early as January next year, way ahead of Singapore but for the indifference of Sec. Duque who failed to work on the necessary documentary requirement, namely, the Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA), as he should have done,"" Lacson said in a statement.Duque said that on June 24, Pfizer submitted an overview of their candidate vaccine against Covid-19 and it was referred to the Department of Science and Technology Philippine Council for Health Research and Development on June 29 for evaluation.He added that on August 6, they sent a letter to Pfizer, reminding it that the vaccine has to be scrutinized by the said agency.Duque said they also asked the company about the utilization of the new mRNA technology in their vaccine, in which the company has no experience about.On August 11, he said Pfizer submitted a draft of the CDA but it was supposed to be signed by the Office of the President through the Office of the Executive Secretary (ES) and not by his department.He said the ES should be the signatory in behalf of all the government agencies and to spare the company from signing a confidentiality agreement from each agency.On September 4, the DOH, DOST officials and ES Salvador Medialdea met with Pfizer for the updates on its vaccine development while the revised CDA was received by Duque from ES on September 14.On September 24, Duque said the ES advised that the signatory would be the DOH due to repeated review from concerned agencies.But he said the DOH cannot do such, as it cannot represent the whole of the government, which he said was the same reason why Department of Science and Technology (DOST) and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. had signed the CDA separately.Duque on September 25 replied that the Philippine government will have an alignment meeting with Pfizer, since he, and not Medialdea, is set to sign the CDA.Duque said he signed the CDA on October 20, while DOST and Galvez did it in November.He said he also asked the pharmaceutical company for several revisions on the CDA as some of its provisions were “one-sided.”The Health secretary signed the CDA three weeks after the advice of the ES that the DOH will be the signatory in the document.“Hindi ito simpleng parang gagawa ka lang ng dokumento (This is not as simple as creating a document),” he said.Pfizer was the first company to release a Covid-19 vaccine in the United States.

Naging cynic ako sa kanila. Kung ibigay, eh di ibigay. If you want to help, you deliver (and) stop talking. What we need is the vaccine, not your verbose speeches,” he added.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Rolando Domingo has confirmed that drug manufacturer Pfizer filed on December 23 for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) of its vaccine candidate against Covid-19.Roque said it will take the FDA 21 days to evaluate and approve the EUA, but vaccination would start as soon as stocks become available.In February, Duterte ordered the revocation of the VFA, a pact since 1999 which permits the conduct of joint US and Philippine troops’ military training.This came following the cancellation of the US visa of Senator Ronald Dela Rosa, a former police chief and principal implementer of the government’s drug war.Duterte has suspended the abrogation of the VFA amid the pandemic.Meanwhile, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said a vaccination program against Covid-19 may start in May 2021 at the earliest.He said they were working to secure 20 million and 10 million doses for the government and private sector, respectively.Galvez said the government might have contracts with Novavax and Pfizer by January. It also has an initial arrangement for 20 million doses with Moderna.“So all in all sir if we will get Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, J&J, and also Moderna, we might have more or less 80 million doses. And also recently, Gamaleya of Russia also negotiated for another 25 million,” Galvez told the President Saturday.He brushed aside accusations that the government is focusing only on a few vaccine sources.“It is a portfolio. Basically, ang mauuna, sir, is AstraZeneca ‘yung magiging contract natin,” he said.“Next is ang Novavax from Serum of India. Next is Pfizer, and then maybe Johnson & Johnson. We have also the discussion of the head of terms and also the supply agreement and also with Moderna; and then followed by Gamaleya and also the Sinovac,” he added.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1877909/Manila/Local-News/Russias-Covid-19-vaccine-to-cost-less-than-$10-per-dose,Russia’s Covid-19 vaccine to cost less than $10 per dose,,"November 24, 2020","THE Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, announced on Tuesday, November 24, 2020, the cost of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine for international markets at less than $10 per dose starting from February 2021, or less than $20 for the two doses necessary to vaccinate one person.Sputnik V will be two or more times cheaper than foreign vaccines based on mRNA technology with similar efficacy rates, the RDIF said in a statement. For Russian citizens, vaccination with Sputnik V will be free of charge.The uniqueness of the Russian vaccine lies in the use of two different vectors based on the human adenovirus, which allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to vaccines using one and same vector for two doses.Currently, RDIF and partners have launched production of the lyophilized (dry) form of the vaccine, which is stored at a temperature of +2 to +8 degrees Celsius. Such a regime enables the distribution of the vaccine in international markets, as well as expanding its use in hard-to-reach regions, including areas with tropical climates.Current agreements between RDIF and leading foreign pharmaceutical companies allow production of the vaccine abroad for 500 million people per year starting from 2021. RDIF is currently considering additional applications from a number of countries and companies to further increase production capacity.The first foreign deliveries of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will be made to customers in January 2021 based on existing partnerships with foreign manufacturers. Those customers, who have recently submitted their requests, will be able to receive the first batches of the vaccine starting from March 2021.“We are ready to start deliveries of the Sputnik V vaccine to foreign markets thanks to partnerships with manufacturers in India, Brazil, South Korea, China and four other countries,” said RDIF chief executive officer Kirill Dmitriev.As of November 24, more than 22,000 volunteers were vaccinated with the first dose and more than 19,000 volunteers with the first and the second dose of the vaccine at 29 medical centers in Russia as part of the ongoing clinical trials.Currently, Phase III clinical trials are approved and are ongoing in Belarus, the UAE, Venezuela and other countries, as well as Phase II-III in India.As of November 24, no unexpected adverse events were identified as part of the research. Some of those vaccinated had short-term minor adverse events such as pain at the injection point and flu-like symptoms including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache.During the clinical trials, the safety of the vaccine is constantly being monitored; information is analyzed by the Independent Monitoring Committee comprising leading Russian scientists. Collection, quality control and data processing is conducted in line with ICH GCP standards and involves the active participation of Moscow’s Health Department and Crocus Medical, the contract research organization (CRO).The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades - while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called ""spikes"" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body's stable immune response.On September 4, The Lancet, one of world’s leading medical journals, published a research paper on the results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of the vaccine that showed no serious adverse events and an effective immune response of those vaccinated.Requests for more than 1.2 billion doses of Sputnik V vaccine came from more than 50 countries. The vaccine supplies for the global market will be produced by RDIF’s international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries.On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Center was registered by Russia’s Health Ministry and became the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19.

(Let the senators sleep, and let’s wait for the document to be printed and forwarded to the Palace.)The proposed Covid-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 would expedite the vaccine procurement and administration processes.It augments the budget of state-owned Philippine Health Insurance Corp.

It did not also say that it’s contraindicated. What it said was that it has low efficacy against mild disease. But when you look at the whole spectrum, the vaccine provides 100 percent protection from severe disease and hospitalization, and over 70 percent protection from moderate disease. This is a very critical piece of information that we should share to the nation.)The Sinovac inactivated vaccine, which was developed by Sinovac Life Sciences in China, will be administered to clinically healthy adults 18 to 59 years old. It will be given in two doses, 0.5 ml each, four weeks apart.While it showed low efficacy among healthcare workers who are directly exposed to Covid-19 patients, the Sinovac vaccine was shown to be 100-percent efficacious against hospitalization.It also showed an efficacy of 78 percent among adults with mild to severe symptoms.In Turkey, phase 2 clinical trials among healthy adults showed an efficacy of 91.5 percent while in Indonesia, the vaccine yielded an efficacy rate of 65.3 percent. Indonesia issued an EUA for Sinovac on January 11, 2021 and certified it as halal.As of Wednesday, Sinovac Biotech general manager Helen Yang said the vaccine has been administered to over 20 million people, both in China and outside of China.Twelve countries have already received the Sinovac vaccine, including Thailand, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Colombia. Three more are expected to get the vaccine by the end of this week, Yang said.Common symptoms from the Sinovac vaccine are pain at the injection point, headache and fatigue. There have been no reports of deaths related to the vaccine, Yang added. (Marites Villamor-Ilano / SunStar Philippines)",sunstar

Under Resolution No. 68 of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the DOST and the Department of the Interior and Local Government will sign a memorandum of agreement on the implementation of the zoning guidelines, especially in the National Capital Region (NCR).Dela Peña said the DOST-led sub-technical working group will also recommend the creation of a safety and monitoring committee which will be independent of the trial sponsor.He said the government is just waiting for the WHO to release the protocols.“We hope that by October, the WHO has already released the list of protocols,” he said.The DOST chief also said the government has signed confidentiality disclosure agreements (CDA) with five vaccine developers, namely, Seqirus in Australia, Gamaleya in Russia, Adimmune in Taiwan, Sinovac in China and Sinopharm in China.As of September 10, eight institutes and pharmaceutical companies were leading the global race to develop a vaccine against Covid-19 and were either conducting or have completed phase three clinical trials.These are AstraZeneca with University of Oxford, CanSino with Beijing Institute of Technology, Gamaleya Research Institute of Russia, Janssen Pharmaceutical (USA), Sinovac (China), Sinopharm (China), Moderna (USA), and Pfizer (USA).Clinical trials for the use of virgin coconut oil (VCO), lagundi and tawa-tawa as treatment or adjunct therapy are also ongoing in the country.Trials on the use of VCO in suspect and probable cases of Covid-19 at the Sta. Rosa Community Hospital are expected to be finished in October and the results should be out by November.The PGH is currently recruiting volunteers for trials on the use of VCO for hospitalized moderate and severe cases.Screening is ongoing for patients who will receive lagundi as standard treatment for mild cases.The use of tawa-tawa as adjunct therapy for Covid-19 is under review by the Joint Research Ethics Board in four government hospitals under the Department of Health.WHO trials for additional treatments for hospitalized Covid-19 patients, meanwhile, now involve 980 subjects.Trials for Japanese flu drug favipiravir in Covid-19 patients with pneumonia will start in the third week of September while the use of melatonin is still awaiting approval by the Food and Drugs Administration.The Philippines’ participation in the WHO trials was approved by the IATF through Resolution No. 47.Dela Peña said its implementation will be spearheaded by PGH.

As of Monday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not issued any Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the use of any Covid-19 vaccine in the Philippines.“Per our inquiry, members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) were the first ones from the AFP who were vaccinated owing to the nature of their mission and function,” Arevalo said in a social media post Monday.“As the unit primarily tasked to protect and secure the highest official of the land, the PSG will have to ensure that the President is safe from all threats—including Covid-19,” he added.He issued this statement less than an hour after saying he was “not aware of Covid-19 inoculation made to military personnel” and of any vaccination program sanctioned by the AFP leadership.Arevalo was reacting to the Philippine Army's confirmation of the President’s statement that some uniformed men have received the vaccine from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm. Duterte mentioned this during a meeting with some Cabinet members and infectious disease specialists on Saturday, December 26.“I have to be frank and I have to tell the truth. I will not foist a lie.

He did not mention whether President Rodrigo Duterte, who had expressed his wish to personally accept the donation, would be there.In the same press briefing with Roque, UP-PGH Medical Director Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi said the UP-PGH has already released a statement that they will accept whatever vaccine that will come with an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Legaspi said the UP-PGH is ready in terms of the infrastructure and logistical requirements of vaccination, including the availability of freezers for the vaccines and the information technology requirement.He stressed that what is important to remember is that whatever vaccine comes will make a difference in helping control the spread of the infection and that the PGH is ready to accept vaccines regardless of brand or where the vaccines came from.Legaspi explained that a 50 percent efficacy means that a person will have a 50 percent probability of developing mild symptoms of Covid-19.The probability of not having moderate symptoms is 75 percent, and the probability that a person is protected from severe Covid-19 is almost 100 percent.He stressed though that all vaccines that will be approved by the FDA will give almost 100 percent protection from developing severe Covid-19.On the prioritization for the vaccine rollout, Roque said the order of prioritization will still be followed.“Una pa rin po dyan ang medical frontliners. Despite the EUA issued by the FDA, nilinaw po yan ni Dr. [Rolando Enrique] Domingo na hindi po ipinagbabawal na ibigay ito sa health professionals,” he said.Roque underscored that this is why it is important to get the position of medical frontliners on the issue because they can still be prioritized for the Sinovac vaccine if they agree to be vaccinated with it.“Wala pong pilitan, yung gustong mag-antay nga po ng ibang brands, siguro ang concession na maibibigay sa kanila is pwede silang humindi at pwede silang mag-antay without losing their priority,” said Roque.Roque was in Negros Oriental to attend a program on the readiness of the province for the vaccination program.Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo said 21 out of 25 municipalities have active cases. As of Thursday, there were 123 active cases in the province.Degamo also informed Roque that the first molecular laboratory in Negros Oriental is now fully operational, as well as a 34-room isolation facility at the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital.

So, kapag hindi po lumabas ang EUA, baka maantala rin ang pagdating ng 600,000 doses ng Sinovac,” he said.Delivery of the first AstraZeneca vaccine shipment is still estimated in late February.Meanwhile, Roque said President Rodrigo Duterte was expected to sign Thursday a memorandum order allowing up to 50 percent advance payment for the procurement of vaccines against Covid-19.This would allow local government units to make the advance payments, he said.Duterte was also expected to certify the indemnification bill as urgent.He said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III has suggested the creation of a P500-million fund to indemnify those who may suffer from vaccination side effects.

Nag-a-apply ako ng distributorship ng Sinopharm,"" Tulfo said in a television interview.""Kaya ko naisipan na magpabakuna kasi ang available sa market although smuggled nga kaya ay gusto kong makatiyak na kung effective sa akin, malamang effective sa sambayanan,"" he added.He denied using his appointment in order to get the vaccine. He said a friend who smuggled the vaccines into the Philippines had provided him with the needed doses.""Wala akong nakitang conflict of interest dito. Private citizen naman ako e. Ang special envoy to China is just an honorific (title),” Tulfo said.""I'm not a government official,"" he added.Tulfo said he also informed Duterte several weeks ago. He said Duterte wants to receive the Sinopharm vaccine but was advised against it.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, in his regular press briefing, said the President’s doctors advised against Sinopharm because it is not covered by an EUA yet. The company has not even filed an application for an EUA.Roque declined to comment on Tulfo's revelation, but said getting inoculated with smuggled Covid-19 vaccines is not a government policy.

LimAsean Centre for Biodiversity Executive Director*THE unprecedented rate by which we are losing our wildlife had hit much closer to home when the Covid-19 pandemic and its global consequences affected our ways of living and brought suffering to many places in the world. While the roll-out of vaccines boosts confidence, this does not fully protect and immunize us from new and emerging diseases that result from the many human-driven activities in our midst.In celebrating World Wildlife Day, the Asean Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) likewise takes the opportunity to direct attention to the role of wildlife habitats, most especially forests. The theme of this year's celebration ""Forests and Livelihoods: Sustaining People and Planet"" is a timely reminder of the life support that forest ecosystems provide.The high species diversity and endemicity in Asean forests makes the region one of the world's critical habitats. However, according to the Global Forest Resources Assessment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, from 2.18 million square kilometers in 2000, the total forest areas in the 10 Asean Member States contracted to 2.07 million square kilometers in 2020. Inevitably, this decline has been causing fragmentation and habitat loss for important animals and plants, not to mention the displacement of indigenous peoples and the reduction of natural buffers for calamities.This ongoing health crisis has brought about deeper reflection and discussion on the repercussions of our relationship with wildlife and the many pathways to safeguard nature.In a recent webinar on preventing pandemics hosted by World Wildlife Fund, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, and Cornell Atkinson Centre for Sustainability, and moderated by Thomas Friedman of The New York Times, the ACB emphasized that apart from enforcing laws against wildlife crimes at the national and regional levels, it is crucial to stop emerging diseases at the source, meaning actions should begin before animals are taken out of their natural habitats. Increasing the coverage and improving the management of protected areas will reduce threats on ecosystems and lessen opportunities for viruses originating from wildlife to spill over to domestic animals and humans.Indeed, protecting our wildlife species contributes to increasing our resiliency. They not only contain and regulate diseases, but they also contribute to the ecological balance and expansion of forests. Wildlife supplies raw materials to sustain the livelihoods of communities living in and around their habitats, and provides basic necessities, such as food and natural cure for various ailments. As we face one crisis after another, we need to take into account the importance of the diversity of flora and fauna in our response and recovery efforts.The Asean Comprehensive Recovery Framework, which was adopted by the Asean leaders in November 2020, calls for a whole-of-community participation and collaboration among sectors. The ACB is optimistic that an integrated approach in protecting and conserving wildlife, along with effective immunization programmes, are concrete steps towards Asean's recovery, as well as in building resilience against future pandemics.In this year's celebrations of World Wildlife Day, we are encouraged to value the interconnectedness of wildlife and people, and appreciate the significant contribution of healthy forests to livelihood and public health. In the long run, protecting wildlife and their habitats somehow also acts as a vaccine that can help build our capacity to withstand socio-economic challenges and ensure a sustainable future.Happy World Wildlife Day!***Dr. Theresa Mundita S.

This would be a great moral and social tragedy,"" it added.Instead of the wealthy, powerful, and influential, the prelates said priority must be given to all medical frontliners, who are at high risk for infection because of their vocation as healthcare professionals.The CBCP said adults, who are at high risk for severe disease because of their age or underlying medical conditions, should be next to receive a vaccine.The bishops said essential workers, whose roles are inherently risky because of necessary interactions with the public and are also important for the common good, should come in third.Finally, the CBCP said individuals, who are living in dense urban areas, where they are vulnerable to the virus, must also be among the priorities.""We urge our National Government to provide the Covid-19 vaccine to everyone without cost to the individual. Otherwise, it will not be available to the poor,"" said the CBCP.Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte said priority will be given to the poorest Filipino households, soldiers, and police as soon as a Covid-19 vaccine is available.The CBCP similarly called on the government to exercise full transparency during the forthcoming conduct of the clinical trials for candidate Covid-19 vaccines.The bishops said transparency must be foremost in every step of the Phase III clinical trials for Covid-19 vaccine.""Full transparency is critical at every step of the development and distribution of a candidate vaccine to ensure the safety and effectiveness of every approved vaccine in an immunization campaign,"" said the CBCP.""This will help bolster public confidence in the initiatives of medical and governmental authorities,"" it added.This, the CBCP said, means that before any Phase III clinical trial begins, the results of Phases I and II trials must be evaluated by designated ethics and expert panels and approved by national regulatory agencies and that data should be made publicly available so that other scientists and medical professionals can confirm the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine.At the conclusion of the protocol, the CBCP said the findings of the Phase III clinical trial must also be made public, regardless of outcome.""It is our prayer that the clinical trials conducted in our country will benefit the global effort to end the pandemic,"" it said.To note, United States firm Johnson & Johnson-Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Chinese company Sinovac, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute have all applied to conduct Phase III of the clinical trials for their candidate Covid-19 vaccines.

REYES,"January 12, 2021","A KNOWN US-based Filipino Dominican priest and microbiologist has joined the global call for people, like those in the Philippines, to avail themselves of the vaccination program against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) amid reports that many are unwilling to be inoculated after being influenced by unscientific claims and broader conspiracy theories.""To be clear, as soon as a Covid-19 becomes available for which I am eligible, whether in the USA or here in the Philippines, I intend to be vaccinated with it,"" said Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, chief researcher at Austriaco Laboratory and professor of biology and theology at Providence College in Providence, Rhode Island, USA.""Also, as soon as a vaccine becomes available for my mother here in the Philippines, I will encourage her to be vaccinated with it,"" he added.Austriaco, who is also developing his own affordable and accessible yeast-based vaccine, said he decided to come forward after receiving numerous queries on his views about the vaccines.As the Philippine government announced that it will roll out its vaccination program in the first quarter of 2021, public trust and confidence in vaccines have apparently waned, according to a report from Asia Catholic news site Licas.news.Latest survey from Octa Research Group revealed that only 25 percent of the respondents would be willing to be vaccinated, while 28 percent would choose not to be vaccinated once the vaccines are available in the country.Another survey from Pulse Asia showed that only 32 percent were willing to be inoculated, while 47 percent would not receive the vaccine and 21 percent were undecided.Vaccine advocacyWhile Austriaco admitted that he has ""been very busy"" with Covid-19 pandemic management in the Philippines, he said ""it is time"" for him to encourage the public to receive the vaccines, this also as vaccination campaigns build up around the globe.""Why? First, because these vaccines will save lives and protect our health care system. They will end the pandemic and remove the always looming threat of lockdown and social disruption. They will allow us to hug again!"" said Austriaco, who is currently on sabbatical as a visiting professor of biological sciences at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila.""Second, because I trust the scientific process that has gone into the development and testing of these vaccines... Moreover, these vaccines rely on decades of research,"" he added.The Dominican microbiologist said these vaccines ""were developed in record time.""""But that is what you would expect when scientists have unlimited funding to support their experiments and no other burdens to deal with like writing and revising grant proposal after grant proposal in small incremental steps. It is not like scientists just woke up one morning at the beginning of the pandemic and started from scratch. We have known about mRNA for over 50 years, and we know how it is made, used, and destroyed in the cell. We have known about RNA viruses for decades as well, including the subclass of RNA viruses that are called coronaviruses,"" said the Dominican priest, who obtained a doctorate in biology from the renowned Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he was a fellow of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.According to Austriaco, the ""decades of experiments and countless sleepless nights by tens of thousands of scientists who spent hours and hours toiling at the bench form the bedrock of the vaccines that are now being deployed around the world.""""A lot of great science went into these vaccines and a lot of great scientists were needed to generate that great science,"" he added.While there are those who questioned about the speed of the vaccine testing, Austriaco maintained that ""these vaccines are safe and efficacious.""""And in the end, the numbers say it all. And what the numbers say is that. Tens of thousands were tested and they developed an appropriate immune response to the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Tens of thousands were tested and none got very ill or died from the vaccines,"" he added.Debunking unscientific claimsAs to whether these vaccines have side effects, Austriaco answered: ""Absolutely! That is what the clinical trials have also shown. I expect to have a sore arm for a day or so. I expect to have a fever and to feel worn out for a time.""""But these are signs that the vaccine is working! These are signs that the vaccine is jumpstarting my immune response so that I can make those precious antibodies that will wipe out the Covid-19 virus if I am exposed to them for real in the future,"" he said.""And the pain and discomfort and just plain inconvenience do not compare with what I would experience if I did get a severe case of Covid-19, or God forbid, with what someone else would experience if I infected them with Covid-19 and they ended up in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit). As a Christian, I am taught that a broken world can only be redeemed by sacrifice. This is the meaning of the Cross. In my view, the few days of discomfort and downright crappiness that I expect to experience after each dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will be my contribution to the sacrifice that heals the world (cf. Col 1:24),"" he wrote.While there were reports about rare allergic reactions to the virus, the priest-microbiologist maintained that there is a solution to it.""In the first two weeks of the vaccination campaign in the USA, 21 cases of severe allergic responses were recorded among 1,893,360 vaccinations. Most of these allergic responses (71 percent) occurred within 15 minutes of injection. Am I concerned? Not really. First, I have not experienced severe allergic responses before. The 21 people who experienced a response to the Covid-19 jab had a history of bad allergic responses. So it is unlikely that I will experience this reaction myself,"" he said.According to Austriaco, the solution to these allergic responses is called the EpiPen.""I have had students who walk around campus with an EpiPen because they know that they are prone to allergic responses. Here in the Philippines, we plan to have EpiPens available everywhere we do vaccinations. So we will be ready. If I or someone else gets an allergic response, we will jab them with that EpiPen!"" he added.On the few reports of people who died days or weeks after receiving the vaccine, the priest-scientist maintained that ""there is no evidence whatsoever that these individuals died because of the vaccine.""""We are vaccinating millions of people around the world right now, so we should expect some to die within a few weeks after receiving the vaccine. Why? Because people die. Especially elderly people. It was just their time, whether or not they had received the vaccine or not,"" he said.He also debunked the claim that the Covid-19 vaccine will make women infertile, saying ""this claim is unreasonable and not supported by the science.""""Moreover, if an antibody response against Covid-19 triggers a response against the human placenta, then we would expect that Covid-19 would trigger miscarriages as the body attacked the placenta while attacking the virus. No increase in miscarriages has been seen among the 45,000+ pregnant women who have been infected with Sars-CoV-2 since the beginning of the pandemic,"" he said.""Finally, there are reports of women becoming pregnant during the vaccine clinical trials after they had developed an immune response against the Sars-CoV-2 virus. This demonstrates that they were not rendered infertile by the vaccine,"" he added.On the fear that the Covid-19 mRNA vaccines will change one's genes, he maintained that ""this claim is unreasonable and not supported by any science.""""For the most part, every human cell has hundreds of thousands of copies of its own mRNA at any one moment in time. We have never seen these mRNAs encoded back into DNA and reinserted back into the human being's DNA, even when the cell is infected with an RNA virus that has the enzyme or molecular machine called reverse transcriptase, which is necessary for making RNA into DNA. If this claim were true, then human cells infected with an RNA virus would contain new DNA from the person's mRNA. Again, this has never been seen,"" Austriaco said.As a priest-scientist, he said he has to ""respect the evidence, whether it is the data of science or the data of divine revelation, and there simply is no evidence that mRNA vaccines will reprogram our genes.""""Finally, I have to address the moral complications raised by the fetal cell lines derived from an abortion decades ago that were used to manufacture some of the Covid-19 vaccines. As a priest, I know that different people have different thresholds of sensitivity to evil. Some feel evil exquisitely. Others not so much. We should therefore expect different people to reach different moral conclusions that could even be opposed to each other while both remaining virtuous responses.""Personally, I will choose to avoid the vaccines made with these cell lines. However, as the Vatican itself has noted, it is not immoral to avail oneself of these morally controversial vaccines, especially if no other options are available.""In the end, I believe that the unprecedented, and really, unexpected, successes we have witnessed in the production of these vaccines are a blessing from the Lord,"" he wrote.Cases of coronavirus, which affected 218 countries and territories around the globe after its first recorded infection in Wuhan, China in December 2019 have already reached 90,879,255, as of January 11, 2021.The virus has killed 1,946,619 people worldwide, while 64,974,697 have recovered.

Ang census sa bawat household ay kukunin sa barangay para makilala ang mga residente at masiguro ang follow-up,” said Roque.Transient residents will not be included in the trials unless they provide proof that they will be staying at the trial site for the next two years.Independent clinical trials that will be conducted by private vaccine manufacturers will also be assigned trial zones in such a way that there will be no competition among other teams conducting vaccine trials, said Secretary Fortunato T. de la Peña of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), which is the lead agency of the IATF’s sub-TWG on Vaccine Development.De la Peña, who was a resource person in the said press briefing, said that in case of outbreak situations, WHO ST vaccine teams can move into the affected barangay where they can conduct their vaccine trials provided that there will be facilities that they would need such as storage for vaccines, among others. If they need more facilities, the vaccines team can move to the adjacent barangay, said the DOST chief.In case of shortfalls in the recruitment of trial participants by specific barangays, the deficit can be taken from other barangays with faster recruitment to meet the total target sample size.Further, a Memorandum of Agreement between the DOST and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), witnessed by the appropriate local government unit (LGU) officials and the vaccine teams, is being proposed.The IATF’s sub-TWG for vaccine development also recommended the creation of a communication plan for the Covid-19 vaccine clinical trials that will consider different levels of LGU and the criteria and considerations for recruitment.De la Peña stressed the importance of close coordination with LGUs for zoning in barangays. He added that LGUs will be informed on how to prepare for the zoning and that the DOST already has a template or communication plan for this.In terms of follow-up of trial participants, it was recommended that alternative modes of follow-up must be put in place such as the use of barangay health workers or barangay volunteers, and the use of cellular phones for reminders.The IATF also approved the recommendation to create a separate sub-TWG on vaccine procurement to be led by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM)-Procurement Service, with the DOH, Department of Finance, DBM, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Trade and Industry, Philippine International Trading Corporation, National Economic and Development Authority, and the DILG as member agencies.It will be up to the DOH to decide on which vaccine and the number of vaccines to be procured, as well as the program of vaccine development.

I will open the economy. Talagang hirap tayo. You know, people have to eat. People have to work. People have to pay for their upkeep. And the only way to do it is to open the economy and for businesses to regrow,” he said in a press conference after the ceremonial turnover of the vaccines.“Kung maka-hit tayo ng 40 million, kung nand’yan na ‘yung vaccine - maski meron tayong mga 20, 30 (million) - buksan ko na dahil sa economy,” he added.The Philippines received a donation of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac inactivated vaccine from China on February 28. It was the first batch of vaccines to reach the country, after more than a year since the first Covid-19 case was confirmed.A second batch, composed of 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine, is expected to arrive on Monday, March 1, through the Covax facility, which aims to vaccinate an average of 20 percent of the population in 92 low and middle-income countries.Duterte earlier rejected the recommendation of the government’s economic team to place the entire country under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ), the most relaxed form of community quarantine, in March because no vaccines had reached the country yet.Asked about face-to-face classes, which have been suspended since mid-March 2020 because of the pandemic, Duterte was uncompromising.“I cannot make that decision. It will place the children in jeopardy. Alam mo, iba na ‘yang decision, iba na ‘yang maraming mamatay. I am not ready to lose the lives of our young people, our children,” he said.The Department of Education (DepEd) had recommended that limited face-to-face classes be allowed in 1,904 schools under 126 school divisions.Read: Easing of restrictions, in-person classes hinge on vaccine rolloutMeanwhile, Duterte reiterated that the government respects the medical frontliners’ freedom of choice.“‘Yung mga ayaw, ‘yung gusto pa ng ibang klaseng (vaccine), there’ll be AstraZeneca if you do not have faith in the Chinese (vaccine)...Nobody, but nobody can really tell you how effective it is...It would depend on your body,” he said.Based on the prioritization framework approved by the government, medical frontliners are given first priority in the vaccination program against Covid-19.The armed forces, for whom China made the donation, will also be prioritized.Members of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (Nitag), which crafted the prioritization framework, have stressed that vaccination is voluntary on the part of the recipients.Medical frontliners are merely given the “right of first refusal after an informed choice,” Nitag member Nina Carandang had said.Read: Healthcare workers retain vaccination priority slotsHealthcare workers from 34 hospitals, including Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City and Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City, were supposed to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.But delivery of the 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine through Covax has been delayed because of the delayed submission by the government of an indemnification agreement.This agreement is a requirement imposed on Covax-eligible countries to protect vaccine developers and manufacturers from the risks of unforeseen claims due to injury associated with the vaccine.The Sinovac inactivated vaccine, which was developed by Sinovac Life Sciences in China, is the third vaccine that was granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines.It will be administered to clinically healthy adults 18 to 59 years old. It will be given in two doses, 0.5 ml each, four weeks apart.While it showed only a 50.38 percent efficacy among healthcare workers who are directly exposed to Covid-19 patients, it was found to be 100-percent efficacious in preventing hospitalization and severe Covid-19.Other vaccines with EUA in the Philippines are Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca-Oxford. An EUA allows the use of a vaccine under development during a public health emergency. (Marites Villamor-Ilano / SunStar Philippines)",sunstar

Our negotiations are being conducted parallel to their clinical trials,” Galvez told the Senate.He said Novavax expected approval of their candidate vaccine for emergency use by March.The government and the private sector also signed an agreement earlier with AstraZeneca for the advance purchase of 2.6 million doses of AZD1222.Local government units (LGUs), through the national government, have also signed agreements with Astra Zeneca.Among them are Iloilo City (600,000 doses), Pasig City (400,000 doses) and City of Manila (800,000 doses).Negotiations were still ongoing for 25 million to 40 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech, 25 million to 30 million doses from AstraZeneca, P25 million doses from Sinovac and 25 million doses from Gamaleya, Galvez said.“I am very happy to report to the Senate that all the negotiations are very successful and we are now in the final stages for supply agreement,” Galvez told the Senate.The use of any candidate vaccine against Covid-19, however, will require an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA.As of Monday, FDA Director General Enrique Domingo said only Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Gamaleya have filed applications for the EUA.Novavax and Sinovac have yet to apply for EUA.Domingo urged Galvez to coordinate with the FDA so that these companies could apply for an EUA this early.Meanwhile, Galvez said Metro Manila mayors have agreed that majority of the vaccines that they will be acquiring will be that of Pfizer.Pfizer and Moderna vaccines may also be provided to the cities of Davao and Cebu, and other areas that can provide cold storage facilities.The AstraZeneca and other candidate vaccines will be deployed to other areas, Galvez added.

That is also due to the fact that two various adenovirus vectors are used,” he added.RDIF is Russia's sovereign wealth fund which is financing the mass production of the vaccine.The Lancet articleGamaleya’s findings from phases one and two clinical trials were published in medical journal The Lancet Friday, nearly a month after the vaccine was registered in Russia.Sputnik V, which was named after the first space satellite by the then Soviet Union, was registered by the Russian Ministry of Health on August 11, 2020, making it the first registered Covid-19 vaccine on the market.Based on the article on The Lancet, the Russian vaccine induced “strong humoral and cellular immune responses” in all the 76 healthy participants in its phase one and two clinical trials.Only mild adverse reactions were reported such as pain at the injection site, hyperthermia, headache, asthenia, and muscle and joint pain.These adverse reactions are, however, typical for vaccines, Gamaleya researchers said.Gamaleya held clinical trials between June 18 and August 3, 2020, with a total of 76 healthy adult participants, or 38 for each phase, in two hospitals in Russia.Sputnik V is an adenovirus vector-based vaccine with two vector components, recombinant adenovirus type 26 (rAd26) and recombinant adenovirus type 5 (rAd5).In The Lancet article, the researchers said they administered either one dose of rAd26-S or one dose of rAd5-S on each subject and assessed the vaccine’s safety for 28 days under phase one.In phase two, which began five days after phase one, the researchers administered a prime-boost vaccination, with rAd26-S given on day 0 and rAd5-S on day 21.To compare the immune response after vaccination with natural immunity, the researchers said they collected convalescent plasma from Covid-19 patients who have recovered.No adverse effectsDuring the press conference Friday, researcher Inna Dolzhikova said they did not monitor any serious adverse effects.“When the safety (of the vaccine) was researched, there was no serious adverse effect identified,” said in the same press conference.This makes Sputnik V different from the over 100 other vaccine candidates, she added.Aside from the greater immune response, Dolzhikova said they have also found that the vaccine worked even in those who have adenovirus immunity.Adenoviruses cause fever, cough, sore throat, diarrhea, and pink eye.Dolzhikova said the presence of pre-existing adenovirus immunity does not impact on the efficacy of Sputnik V.“Our vaccine is based on the heterological approach of prime-boost immunization...This approach enables us to overcome the potential negative impact of pre-existing adenovirus immunity on the efficacy of our vaccine,” Dolzhikova added.Gamaleya has launched phase three clinical trials involving 40,000 volunteers.Gintsburg said the clinical trials will last for six months, during which researchers will double check the safety and immunogenicity as well as the epidemiological efficacy of the vaccine.Vaccine productionDmitriev said around 40 countries have expressed interest in locally producing the Sputnik V vaccine.He said the RDIF was developing partnerships with other countries to allow technology transfer and local production of the vaccine since Russia would be focused on mass producing the vaccine for its domestic market.In India, which produces around 60 percent of the global vaccine supply, Dmitriev said they were engaged in a “very close dialogue with the corresponding ministries and leading manufacturers”.“And we have achieved certain agreements with the leading companies and we do recognize India and its potential to become one of the hubs for the production of vaccine indeed not just for the Indian market, but also for other countries,” he said.Earlier, Russian Federation Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev said the Philippines could also become a regional hub for the production of the vaccine and a potential supplier to other countries.Read: Russia’s envoy to PH: Vaccine may be produced locallyKhovaev said technology transfer from Gamaleya to manufacturers in the Philippines will open up new horizons for bilateral economic and scientific cooperation.He also said Russian and Filipino experts have started exchanging opinions on the technical aspects of conducting phase three clinical trials in the Philippines.

It will be a moral obligation for us,” he said.“We are asking all our leaders na kung puwede i-dedicate muna natin sa healthcare workers ito pong AstraZeneca at saka Sinovaac considering na tapusin muna natin yung healthcare workers at senior citizens,” he added.Beverly Ho, DOH director for Promotion and Communication Service, cited the finding of focus group discussions (FGD) and social media posts that the public confidence in vaccines is likely to increase after they see officials get it first.“The FGD just showed na ito ‘yung gusto nilang makita na, ‘Ah, actually even leaders pala gagawin. Mauna kayo bago kami.’ That’s actually the narrative we see in social media so that’s also what we’ve gotten from the FGDs,” she said in a virtual press briefing.She said, however, that the health workers should still be inoculated first because of the limited supply.

Officials of the Inter-Agency Task Force managing the pandemic response, as well as from the Department of Health are expected to attend.“We have to make sure that workers providing essential services are included in the government’s priority list, on top of its initial pronouncements of prioritizing healthcare workers, the police and the military, and the elderly,” Villanueva said.“Workers in the services industry, construction workers in public and private projects, market attendants, delivery riders, security guards, and workers in food retail and distribution networks are those who the government should consider to include in the priority list. They are the workers who keep the economy going. They should be included in the vaccination program,” he added.Minimum wage earners work in high-risk workplaces such as construction sites, factories, groceries, and public markets, among others, and they rely on public transportation to move around, Villanueva said.He pointed out that the importance of providing them with access to vaccines since they are working for the subsistence of their families.The lawmaker filed Senate Resolution No. 598 to look into the government’s vaccination program to assess how workers would be covered given the initial pronouncements of the country's vaccine czar that the planned inoculation intends to cover 70 percent of the population in the next three to five years.“Our market attendants ensure that basic goods are readily available. Our garbage collectors help us keep our communities clean. Our security guards protect establishments. Our delivery riders allow us to buy our basic needs without going out of our houses and exposing ourselves to the risk of getting infected. That is why these are among the workers who must be included in the vaccination program because they provide essential services,” Villanueva said.About 57.2 percent (22.76 million) of the country’s 39.8-million employed workers are in the services sector, according to the latest Labor Force Survey in October 2020.

The simulation provided a view on what is expected to happen once the vaccines arrive in the country.Dr. Jessie Fantone, DOH provincial director for Zambales who was in Subic Freeport to review the Subic simulation, commended the SBMA for adhering to the DOH strategy in the fight against Covid-19, which is Prevent, Detect, Isolate, Treat, and Reintegrate (PDITR).The SBMA Public Health and Safety Department (PHSD) demonstrated to the five steps in the administration of the vaccine.These are registration; pre-vaccination counseling and final consent; screening; vaccination; and post-vaccination monitoring, surveillance, and recording.Eisma also pointed out that the SBMA has been at the forefront in the battle against Covid-19 since Covid-19 broke out in early 2020. Aside from its medical team, the Subic agency has established Covid-19 isolation and monitoring facilities and partnered with the Philippine Red Cross in putting up a swabbing center and specimen collection facility.As of now, only one Covid-19 case remains active in the Subic Bay Freeport -- that of a transient worker who tested positive last Februayr 10.Eisma said the last reported case among residents of Subic Freeport was on December 24, while that among SBMA employees was in February 5.

If this problem persists, hog raisers will surely end up losers with their businesses,"" said Trinidad Gonzales, spokesman of the Pampanga Swine Producers Association, whose members are composed mostly of large piggery farms in the province.Gonzales said the P65-billion hog industry in Pampanga has repeatedly sent its appeal to the National Government to find ways and help the ""dying business"" brought about by ASF infestation.He said the group can no longer meet the demands of local markets because of lack of supply.One of the piggery farms in Pampanga, Gonzales said, has to depopulate 12,000 heads of hog to prevent the spread of ASF. He did not mention the owner of the farm.""Our inventory for the whole province is only five percent and it's not enough to cover the demand for pork in the province alone. This translates to an increase of prices of pork meat per kilo due to limited supply in the market,"" said Gonzales.He added that meat dealers have to rely for their supplies from Visayas and Mindanao, not to mention the imported meats from China citing affordability and much lower prices than local sources.Prevailing prices for pork in Pampanga as press time soared to as high as P350 per kilo as compared to the P220 per kilo during ASF-free period.Meanwhile, a total of 6,718 hog raisers in the province benefitted from the P32 million worth of livestock given by DA and the Provincial Government recently.The initial aid is part of the recovery and rehabilitation program intended for those who were affected by ASF, which caused massive setbacks to the province's hog industry in October last year.Governor Dennis Pineda said the rehabilitation program is an additional assistance to ASF-affected farmers to give them a chance to recover from their losses, especially with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.""This project is a livelihood program given by Secretary William Dar and President Rodrigo Duterte in addition to the payment given to us for culled pigs last year.

A slang we normally hear from one who is facing a problem and in a tight fix. The precarious financial balance may be giving Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez a scare and sleepless nights. The country’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted like what most countries are experiencing since the pandemic. It is aggravated by the enormous corruption committed by the thieves in Duterte’s administration. The overpriced personal protective equipment, the billions lost in the PhilHealth money, ayudas controversy, etc. Over the weekend, Dominguez said he will push through with the plan to privatize functions of the Philippine Amusement Gaming Corporation and Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office. It is not yet a desperate move. What is desperate will be the sale of government properties just as the thinking of selling prized real estate in Japan that are part of reparations after World War 2 ended.Once I wrote in the space why the giant property developer Ayala Inc. elected to locate in Porac town instead of developing a vast track, say in Clark’s subzone or at the New City. The difference is the fact that the Porac property was purchased which they can call their own, while Clark Development Corporation and Bases Conversion Development Authority can only enter into long-term leases. The law prohibits the sale. It will take a congressional approval before the vast lands of the former US military installation can be sold to private ownership. Sale and lease can be the mode. Now think about this and make a mathematical calculation if and when the government can privatize the whole of former Clark Air Force Base. On the fenced area alone, for sure trillions will be realized. Lots and lots of moolah. I am very sure the likes of Dae Sik Han, owner of WIDUS Hotel and Casino, Hongkong businessman Jack Lam, operator of FONTANA Leisure and Resort and Chairman Jo of SUNVALLEY will prefer to purchase their locations now. That’s in line with paying a hefty price of $2 per square meter per month. Imagine the other locators like Yokohama Tires, L& T and all those duty-free shops making the land purchase. We will need the biggest calculator to sum up the amount. In the end, there’s no worry to get the money to purchase the coronavirus vaccine which will cost $10 per vial for the 109 million Filipinos. If government allowed the purchase of Fort Bonifacio in Taguig, why not the fenced area of Clark Freeport?***Leaders today learned to have a vision prepared for the future of their communities, compared to the past few generations of leaders our country had. Sorry to say but many or maybe all weren’t forward-looking. Look at our towns and cities today. They are no longer live-able because there was a lack of vision among the leaders of yesteryears. There are no railways working anymore in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. Bangladesh, considered one of the poorest countries, looks better. This country has a railroad system. Four years of Duterte and counting, his Department of Transportation failed.The ride from Tutuban main station in Manila up to Damortis in La Union and making stops in Malolos and Angeles are only memories now. Even MacArthur Highway became so narrow and government only started the expansion during President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo's watch. How many presidents of our country came from the central and northern Luzon, say Elpidio Quirino, Ferdinand Marcos, Ramon Magsaysay, the two Macapagals and the two Aquinos. How many speakers of the House of Representatives came from central and northern Luzon? What happened to their advisers?

Covid-19 is believed to be part of that stage and the process has been unrolling towards the rise of sugarcoated evil: first a one world government, then the antichrist.There have been theories that the stage was set way back in the 1970's by people that include former US State secretary Henry Kissinger who is much alive today at 97, as well as David Rockefeller (1915-2017) because of statements they had made. Both are known as preachers of depopulation.With Rockefeller now gone and Kissinger too old, Bill Gates has turned out to be a disciple. But let's review the elders first.One time in an address to the Bilderberger organization meeting in Evian, France, Kissinger said:""Today, Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order; tomorrow, they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will pledge with world leaders to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by their world government."" (Transcribed from a tape recording made by one of the Swiss delegates, May 21, 1992.)On the other hand, Rockefeller, who was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberger, left us the following quotes:""Some even believe we are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as 'internationalists' and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure -- one world, if you will. If that is the charge, I stand guilty, and I am proud of it."" (David Rockefeller, from his autobiography, Memoirs 2002)""Whatever the price of the Chinese Revolution, it has obviously succeeded not only in producing more efficient and dedicated administration, but also in fostering high morale and community of purpose. The social experiment in China under Chairman Mao's leadership is one of the most important and successful in human history."" (David Rockefeller, statement in 1973 about Mao Tse-tung in The New York Times, August 10, 1973.)Rockefeller also said:""We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.""These days, Microsoft's Bill Gates and his wife Melinda (who wears a necklace with inverted cross) are putting more flesh into the ideas of Rockefeller and Kissinger. This, apparently with Covid-19 as a fertile platform.Recently in his Reddit account, Gates said ""digital certificates"" will be used to identify recipients of the upcoming Covid-19 vaccine and that such certificates will also be used to identify who can conduct business or not. Such plan is being backed by a massive organization called ID2020.Gates is known to be pushing called Human Implantable Quantum Dot Microneedle Vaccination Delivery System that covers the development of a Covid 19 vaccine that will come with ""quantum dot microneedles,"" a digital identification mark from ID2020, and a human implantable device for buying and selling cryptocurrency with a patent number of #060606 (reminds us of the 666 Mark of the Beast). The digital ID will come in the form of something called an Immunity Passport.By the way, the vaccine being developed will reportedly contain an enzyme called Luciferase (reminds us of you know who) a vital component.Already last April, a Rockefeller Foundation paper laid out Covid-19-related plans to test and trace the entire USA in the next months via a corps of contact tracers, linked to a real-time database and producing a patient ID number which eventually would be imposed as conditions for work and travel.Such contract tracing is already being done, on grounds of science, in many parts of the world, including the Philippines.Meanwhile, pending Bill Gates' vaccine, One World people, with collusion from Big Pharma, is reportedly suppressing the use of the cheap and readily available hydroxychloroquine as effective cure for Covid-19. They censored and removed a video with multiple medical professionals, including a professor at Yale's schools of medicine and epidemiology, providing a second opinion to the overwhelming media narrative that this drug is somehow dangerous despite the fact that malaria and lupus patients have safely used the drug for decades.It can be fact-checked that even four months before Covid-19 struck, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were preparing to test, track, trace, mask, isolate and corner Americans into forced vaccinations.Eight weeks before Covid 19 was reported in Wuhan, Bill Gates was at the Event 201 discussions which he hosted in New York on October 18, 2019 and there, he presented a simulation about a novel coronavirus that could kill millions.Gates has been at the forefront of research regarding global pandemics and mass vaccination campaigns in the past decade and, on record, repeatedly that the world was not ready for a global pandemic.Of course, it is well known that Gates is an avid adherent of the ""need"" to reduce world population, the same thinking espoused by Kissinger and Rockefeller.Let me end this piece with some advice from the Blessed Mother, as conveyed to mystic Pedro Regis last July 30:""Dear children, your victory is in the Lord. Put your trust and hope in Him and everything will end well for you. Be courageous and proclaim Jesus everywhere. Be proclaimers of the Gospel and defend the teachings of the true Magisterium of His Church. Enemies will increasingly unite in order to keep you from the truth. Many will be deceived and will embrace what is false. Do not forget: The silence of the righteous strengthens the enemies of God. Bend your knees in prayer. Humanity is heading towards a great abyss, and the time has come for your return. Listen to Me and I will lead you to the One who is your Only Way, Truth and Life. Onward in defense of the truth. This is the message that I give you today in the name of the Most Holy Trinity. Thank you for having allowed Me to gather you here once more. I bless you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Be at peace.""God be with us all.",sunstar

I decided to do this for the well-being of the Filipino people,” Austriaco told Sunstar Philippines in an interview.He said his project, dubbed “Project Pag-asa (Hope),” is in its “early stages of development.”Austriaco, who is a dual citizen, maintained that the earliest stages of his project “is not expensive.”“It is still in its preclinical stage of development and it will have to be tested in animal models before we can even talk about human volunteers,” said the Dominican microbiologist.According to the priest-scientist, a yeast-based system would not need refrigeration nor injections nor healthcare workers.“For now, I have adequate funding to complete the necessary experiments to make the yeast vaccine delivery system and to do animal testing,” Austriaco said.“There is no need for me to approach any government agencies at this time because this is still a lab-based project. I would only have to seek government approval if the vaccine delivery system works in animals. We will not know this for many months,” he added.In a report from Catholic news site Licas.news, Austriaco said he and his colleagues will be doing the experiments in his laboratory in the United States.The animal testing will be done in a laboratory at the University of Sto.

PELAYO IV,"March 27, 2020","WITH over 190 countries affected by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and nations searching for effective treatment and vaccine, those who stay at home are now waiting for the uncertain. The number of people acquiring positive infection is continuously rising as testing results are being released. The situation may worsen in the coming days. In Luzon, the government is trying to implement stringent measures to contain the rapid spread of the virus and the frontliners are now battling the deadly enemy which is unseen by the naked eye.Business tycoons in the country started lending a helping hand to the government. Some utility companies and banks including a few credit card companies started giving moratorium to their customers. But as of this writing, I wonder why Citibank Philippines has not reached out to offer payment extension during these trying times.We have learned so many stories about the heroism of those in the front lines, the men and women in uniform and those who stayed at work risking their own safety against the exposure of the virus. Social workers, disaster response teams, barangay officials, rural health units and volunteers came out to help their constituents although one local government unit known to be highly urbanized has been criticized for doing a lot of repacking and just a little of distributing.Establishments such as hospitals, pharmacies, supermarkets, public markets, banks, convenience stores, food takeouts and the like need to be open, and hats off to those employees who report to work despite the unavailability of public transport plus the fact that going out means putting oneself at risk for an exposure.Since the start of the community quarantine, the policemen were already outside ready to respond at the crisis despite lacking equipment and proper protection. Salute to Angeles City Director PCOL Joyce Patrick Sangalang and ACPO for doing a job well done despite the limitations. I have to give it also to PLTCOL Eduardo Guevara of Mabalacat City Police who was able to manage the uncoordinated move of famous vlogger Mocha to drop non-Mabalaqueno passengers who arrived from airport. Please support our police officers.And yes, the operation of Clark International Airport went on despite the enhanced community quarantine directive by the national government. Mabalacat City Mayor Cris Garbo was among the first local leaders to notice this as a concern.Fortunately, the city council of Mabalacat and two other LGUs (Angeles and Porac) passed a joint resolution asking President Rodrigo Duterte to temporarily shut down the operation of Clark airport to stop the spread of the deadly virus.Some mayors went out while some went missing. Some delivered assistance right away while some spent a lot of time having photo ops.But the ones who are really at the forefront and at high risk of being infected with Covid-19 are the health providers, the nurses, and our dear doctors. They are the ones who face and touch the people infected with Covid-19. And for the past week, so many valuable lives have been claimed by the corona virus. Our physicians risk everything in order for our country to defeat and rebound from this global crisis. Our frontline doctors have not been with their loved ones since the lockdown. It is easy to sense low morale among physicians when their frustrations are being posted on social media and their group chats. We have heard some of their courageous deeds before their untimely demise.With limited resources, shortage of medical equipment and hospital beds, how can we blame them? In fact, they started to be resourceful and look for alternative ways to protect themselves. Although ill-advised, doctors started to recycle their face masks and PPEs because of scarcity. The plastic bottles used for distilled water have been converted into face shields. They just try what they can and just leave the rest up to God. Although being cautious in their duty, at least ten doctors still have died.Thousands of people have sent messages of thanks to those who perished while fighting the disease. The public consider them heroes as they express their gratitude for their service. These fallen victims are not just part of the statistics. These are people with family and friends. These things must not happen.We do not need dead heroes. I’d like to see my heroes in flesh, not in ashes. I’d like to tell them face-to-face my appreciation for their brave efforts to fight the virus. I appeal to the great nations around the world to help our doctors. Right now, they know what is best for us. Let’s listen to them. Economists and political leaders should not worry about the future. They must worry about the present.This is the best time for politicians to act as public servants and not as VIPs. Protect our doctors.

Sana, hindi totoo iyon kasi andyan na, eh. It was already administered. I just really hope it’s not true at mali iyung ginawa nila,” Pineda said.She added that at the very start, she was already hesitant about the vaccine being brought to Pampanga.“Kinausap ko noon si director [Leonita] Gorgolon ng Department of Health (DOH). Sinabi ko sila, ako, ayoko. I told them we already know the source of dengue and how to control it. You just have to clean the surroundings and monitor the symptoms like high fever. Dapat pag ganoon, ipasok na agad sa ospital. Pati iyung mga RHU (Rural Health Unit) doctors, noon pa sinasabihan ko na ‘pwede ba huwag niyo munang ipasok sa Pampanga iyan kasi hindi pa natin alam iyan kung pwede ba iyan o hindi.’ Pumasok sila sa mga schools at meron na silang nabakunaan,” Pineda shared.According to a report by the Provincial Health Office, the third and final doses of Dengvaxia were administered earlier this year to 32,210 pupils under the division of Pampanga, 6,855 pupils in the division of Angeles City, and 4,691 pupils in the division of City of San Fernando.The governor said the Department of Education (DepEd) should have consulted parents first.“Dapat, ang DepEd kinunsulta muna iyung parents. Tiningnan muna sanang mabuti at ini-explain munang mabuti. Ako, umpisa pa lang, sabi ko huwag mong dalhin sa Pampanga iyan, ayoko. Kaya lang, iyung stocks nila sa DOH, ang binigyan Cebu, Metro Manila at Central Luzon. Even the Chinese ambassador we met recently and who read the news about the dengue vaccine said ‘Maam, you don’t need a vaccine for dengue. You just need to clean the surroundings. But not that vaccine.’ It can be prevented,” she said.“At ngayon nga, andyan na iyan. Sana, sana hindi magkatotoo iyan,” Pineda said. (JTD)",sunstar

Eventually, so said the Bible, the mark would be imposed and needed to buy and sell.Even before the pandemic came to be, purportedly from China, Heaven has given mystic Luz de Maria de Bonilla messages about the Mark of the Beast. No, it's not the Covid-19 vaccine. Those who have not heard of the messages have been hitting it right all along: the microchip.The first explicit message on the microchip was in 2015. At that time, the prospects of a chip scenario was unimaginable. With the pandemic with us now, it is easier to comprehend the reality of such a scenario.Here are some of the messages, along the dates when they were received by Luz de Maria.As early as November 23, 2015 from Our Lord Jesus Christ: ""So with faith in My Word, do not allow yourselves, my faithful, to be introduced to the microchip that will spread through the various countries with urgency. Remember that My manna will descend from My House, because I am faithful to My people, if My people are faithful to Me.""From our Blessed Mother on January 31, 2014: ""Darkness advances on Earth mercilessly and this darkness will continue to disturb the minds of men in such a way that man will stop thinking. He will be commanded simply by a microchip that will transform him into an inanimate being, and like a puppet, he will be used by the great and powerful.""Also from the Blessed Mother on July 7, 2017: ""The people of my Son remain inert, refusing to recognize the times in which they live, and the enemy of the soul, with his trickery, is taking over humanity every moment. Technological inventions are praised by the vast majority of humanity without due knowledge. This brings man closer to acquiescing without regard to what the technological novelty is. Thus humanity will welcome the use of the microchip with great confidence, this ingenious and miniscule device being the greatest controller that has ever existed.""Through the microchip, man's own thoughts will be abolished, and the freedom that my Son has given to man will be definitively seized. The microchip is a significant sign before the public appearance of the antichrist.""Parents: You are dominated by the technology of the demon. Each novelty that you place in the hands of your children is a planned tactic so that your children implement the microchip and become part of the worshippers of the antichrist. Your children will become blank creatures, products of technology created to dominate man.""More messages from the Blessed Mother:On October 8, 2015: ""Beloved ones, very soon they will begin with the obligation and the implementation of the microchip so that each one of you accepts it. They know well that this is the seal of Satan, through which they will not only follow in his footsteps and control your social life, but also your economic aspect, even control your mind, so that even if you want to internally, you will not be able to emit a single word of prayer, you will not even be able to ask My Son for help.""On September 9, 2015: ""You have given yourself to evil...you place yourself into the hands of evil. How often I have alerted you about the one who would take over humanity and control you! ... You were expecting a man ... But you have him with you all day long. You reveal your intimate data, expose your family. You have given control of your works and acts to those who manipulate power in the name of evil. You have indulged in misused technology. You reveal your own data and every event in life on social media. There is no need to wait for the microchip to be controlled; they already control you and through this means, condition you to accept being sealed with the microchip.""On October 5, 2015: ""The people of My Son are facing great threats... The microchip is the demon's claim on man and on the soul of creatures. Some looked at it as distant or as a fantasy, but the imposition of the microchip is a reality that will be established soon.""Politics is a facade what it hides behind, and the microchip will appear by surprise, surrounding the City of My Son. The world economy will fall, and through it the government of evil will appear in order to dominate humanity.""Now, from St. Michael the Archangel on May 2, 2015: ""Satan will attack man where man loses control: the economy will be destabilized, and the general crash will begin on a world scale, and those who are not spiritually strong will give their lives over to evil in exchange for a false economic security given by the microchip; and others will end their lives because of money.""Again, Our Lord Jesus Christ on December 14, 2016: ""Do not allow them to seal you. Do not under any circumstances allow them to seal you with the microchip. I will take care of My People, I will take care of My faithful. Just as I feed the birds of the field, so will I take care of My faithful.""In the same year, May 13: ""You should not allow the microchip to be implemented into the human body. Have faith that neither My Son nor I will allow the faithful people to march under the delusions of the henchmen of the antichrist who walks freely through Europe, daring to enter even the House of My Son.""Again, the Blessed Mother on May 2, 2016: ""I do not hide from them that the famine will be felt throughout the world: rich and poor will suffer hunger, money will not be the means to buy food, clothing, or medicine. In the face of the fallen economy, nothing will be valid for human subsistence until they prepare to place on your body the seal of the beast, the microchip, that the rulers of the nations will demand from their people to deliver them into the hands of the antichrist.""More messages from Our Lord Jesus Christ in 2016:April 2: ""The universal currency will arrive quickly, concurrent with the governments that will implant the microchip in their inhabitants. My children will suffer because of it. You must not forget that the food of the birds I provide, just as the food for My People will come from My Hand.""January 21: ""In this technological age in which humanity lives, they have led man to view a chip implanted as normal, but My children must not accept it. It is the sign of the beast through which you will become their slaves.""God bless us all.",sunstar

In 2014, 10 cases of human deaths caused by rabies virus was recorded up from five cases recorded in 2013, said Perez.He also said that some 33 rabid dog cases were recorded in 2013 and 26 positive rabies cases in 2014.
“Perhaps, our rabies prevention and control campaign is still inadequate to educate all the people on the ground,” Perez said, stressing that people are generally neglecting the value of their efforts to eradicate rabies incidence.Perez added that rabies is a deadly disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans caused by virus.“If a person is bitten by an animal, the first thing to do is wash the wound with flowing water and soap, then clean thoroughly with tincture of iodine or alcohol and immediately bring the victim to the animal bite center for treatment and vaccination,” he said.

This is the temporary solution we see to this problem since there is no vaccine yet to ASF,"" he said.DA-Ilocos has prepared a rehabilitation plan to help affected backyard hog raisers in Pangasinan after their pigs were culled as part of the protocol against ASF.Affected hog farmers would be given livestock, such as free-range chicken and cows.Meanwhile, So said there is no cause for alarm regarding the safety of pork meat and by-products being sold in public markets.""The swine being slaughtered in abattoirs have ASF-free certifications. In Pangasinan, we assure you, the live pigs being slaughtered in abattoirs are safe to eat,"" he said.Although some municipalities in the province have been affected by ASF, many of the local government units have been taking measures to ensure that pork meat remains ASF-free, he added.In Rosales town, a task force to prevent ASF has been formed.""They have strengthened the protocols they are implementing here (in Rosales) to prevent the entry of the ASF virus. They discussed the strict enforcement of barangay checkpoints, especially at the entry points from neighbors Tarlac and Nueva Ecija provinces. There is coordination with bus or transport companies stopping at the terminals of SM City in the town for the police to check on baggage or parcels, which might contain frozen foods,"" So said.He said establishments and meat vendors at the town's public market have also been warned to stop selling frozen meat, which will soon be confiscated.""A virus in frozen meat does not die even within 1,000 days,"" So said.In 2019, Mapandan was the first municipality to confirm an ASF case, followed by Bayambang, but it was eventually contained after a lockdown and massive culling were implemented.This year, Malasiqui, Binmaley, Basista, San Carlos City, Sta.

The vaccine has 90 percent effectiveness according to clinical tests but its effectiveness, however, decreases over time.Doctors clarified that most people infected by the Japanese encephalitis virus do not develop any symptoms, or they get only mild, flu-like symptoms. Only around one person in 250 develops ""fully blown"" Japanese encephalitis after being infected.Earlier, DOH regional epidemiologist Jessie Fantone had downplayed the number of JE cases in the Province of Pampanga adding that the same number for dengue cases is sometimes reported in a day.Currently, there are 32 confirmed cases of Japanese encephalitis in Pampanga from a total of 259 suspected cases recorded in the province since July.Nine people, including seven in Central Luzon, have already died this year due to the mosquito-borne JE, the DOH said on Tuesday, September 5.

Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial said there is nothing unusual with the number of JE cases.""There is no surge. The cases reported this year is lower than last year,"" said Ubial in an interview. Ubial however stressed the lower number of cases this year will not stop them from including the JE in the DOH's Expanded Program on Immunization by 2018.Japanese encephalitis is a disease spread through mosquito bites. Symptoms of the JE, which usually take five to 15 days to develop, include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty in moving.JE is also known to cause swelling around the brain and, subsequently, result to the patient going on coma, thereby making it a serious disease that may cause death.",sunstar

There they were silhouetted against the grey morning sky looking like gigantic warts from afar as they pushed themselves up through the surface.I could only set foot on Virgin Island, Governors Island, and Quezon Island on a day trip for the tour guides’ national convention, but we delegates were able to pass by Romulo, Mayors, Macapagal, Lopez, Marcos, and Pilgrimage Island with its 55-foot statue of Jesus.The islands are made up of black coral stone, limestone, and sea rocks. All are shrouded in green and sitting in the clean, deep waters of the West Philippine Sea.It was in Quezon Island where I had my first zipline experience.A really short line, actually, and done without an acrophobe’s jitters – there were too many tourists lining up behind me blocking all escape routes.The guy in charge briskly gave me instructions, “Just remember to lie back when you are almost at the end,” he said. And off I went before I changed my mind. That wasn’t too bad; I survived.Survival is what I hope for the mangrove treelings that we planted earlier that morning. The Bued Mangrove Forest was, for me, the destination du jour.It showed the other face of tourism. With 8.17 hectares dedicated to the environment, Bued is managed systematically. I am impressed that men are hired to scour the place for plastic trash. The tide can carry with its flotsam and jetsam from the sea.Other things impressed me about Pangasinan. In Dagupan where I met Genesis who works for a local company, I found out that he comes from a farming family that farms 24 hectares planted to kalabasa, and only kalabasa.This crop monopoly is fine with the other farmers of their place.There is no competition at all for each farm grows a single crop, each crop unique from the rest. It is like an OTOP (One Town One Product) for farms.The most impressive sight of all is the 1918 Capitol building in Lingayen designed by Ralph Harrington Doane. Restored splendidly in 2007, it is the pride of the Pangasinenses.Also known as the most beautiful capitol building in the country and an architectural treasure, the building is part of the Capitol Complex composed of other edifices such as the 1927 Sison Auditorium, the Capitol Resort Hotel, the Pangasinan Training and Development Center, the Narciso Ramos Sports and Civil Center, and the Governors Residence among others.A Veterans Memorial Park nearby is outfitted with tanque de Guerra and World War II era plane. During the 2nd World War, American forces landed at the Lingayen Gulf.Lingayen Gulf is a wide expanse of beach touching 14 coastal cities and municipalities. Zoning here is applied and there is nary a structure to mar the coast. Boracay should have learned from Pangasinan. Nature left untouched is good for the sight and the soul.The province is also ideal for religious pilgrimages. I was able to visit the Nuestra Senora de la Puripicacion in Binmaley. Built around the 1880’s, the church reflects local culture with the use of bricks, and these are square bricks like the Ilocos tiles we are familiar with.Each trip outside Negros is a learning experience, and like a regular school, there is always no time to learn everything. Yet, three days in Pangasinan made me treasure our diverse Filipino culture, and makes me love it more.",sunstar

BUNYE,"March 20, 2016","THE business community lost one of its pillars with the recent passing of Andrew L. Gotianun Sr.On a personal note, this writer feels the loss and shares the grief of his family, relatives and friends whom he left behind. He was not just a personal friend and mentor. He was also a benefactor of the Municipality,
later City of Muntinlupa which I was privileged to head some years back.Our association began when Filinvest started to develop a part of Alabang, which is now known as Filinvest Corporate City. Filinvest had just entered into a joint venture agreement with the National Government for such purpose.In the early 90s, the area was still largely grassland. Parts of the area were then occupied by the Serum and Vaccine Laboratory (SVL) of the Department of Health. SVL produced, among others, the very rare anti-venom vaccine. An adjunct of the laboratory was a cobra farm – which housed giant cobras collected from all over the Philippines. Before delighted on-lookers, the cobras were “milked” regularly for their venom which were processed into vaccines.Another portion was occupied by the Alabang Stock Farm operated by the Department of Agriculture. The DA bred cattle, goats and other livestock. A favorite destination of Alabang residents was the milk station, where fresh milk was sold every morning.Our very first meeting took place over breakfast. “Meet our ‘Boss,” Mayor Bunye,” he told his wife, Mercedes. I immediately corrected him. “Not Boss. Partner.”To further break the ice, I narrated how my elder brother, Alfredo Jr., funded the acquisition of his first car (a Volkswagen beetle) through a finance company which the Gotianuns owned.Andrew and his wife Mercedes then presented in broad strokes Filinvest’s plan to convert this track of land into mixed-use green community. Its centerpiece would be a giant mall. Name business houses and establishments would invited to come in. And yes, space would be allocated for a world-class hospital.As a town executive, I immediately realized the tremendous benefits such development would bring to Muntinlupa both in terms of additional revenue and new employment opportunities.A sentimental part of me, however, felt a tinge of sadness at the prospect of losing the idyllic Alabang Stock Farm. My paternal grandfather (and my namesake) was for a long time an animal caretaker at the farm. Also, there would be no more dairy where I regularly brought my children to buy our supply of farm-fresh milk every Saturday.As we ended our first meeting, I assured Andrew that as the town’s chief executive my team and I will always endeavor to provide an enabling environment that will be mutually beneficial for business and for the city’s residents.There were many more meetings after that. Mostly in the golf course. Each session turned into an impromptu tutorial on leadership and management. I have read a lot of books and attended several sessions by so-called management “gurus.”But the lessons I learned from Andrew were somehow different.The messages may have sounded similar but I got the feeling that the lessons came from the “Real Deal” -- from someone who has lived and experienced the lessons he was imparting.The lessons did not come in one session. They came in bits, while moving in a golf cart from one green to another, between sips of coffee at the fairway refreshment stop.Once I hooked my ball into a row of houses. During his turn, he drove the ball right in the middle of the fairway. When I complimented him, he said: “The shortest distance between two points is a straight line.” (Forerunner of “Daang Matuwid”?)I noticed, that he was always on time. His tip: “I value my time. I also value the time of others.”About a golfer who cheated: “There’s one thing very important to me in business and for the long-term: always be honest with people.”About an ideal business partner, who else other than his wife Mercedes:“I dream and envision what to do, then my wife will help me realize those dreams.”About the need to continue learning: (He never completed any formal schooling.)“Whenever I go out, I always ask about new business trends. I look for business models which can be done at home. I bring home lots and lots materials to read. Right now, I am looking into energy.”Among the big guns of business, I find him a rarity. Not that he can’t afford it. But I learned that he and his family always travelled tourist class! Maybe, it was his way to remind his family of their humble origins and to remain grounded.The last time I saw him alive was during his birthday party sometime in November. His family -- three generations all -- were there to pay homage. Associates and friends were also there to witness a tribute to a man who was about to leave a legacy of leadership, integrity, excellence and humility.Note: You may email us at totingbunye2000@gmail.com.",sunstar

It was last December when the DOH, in response to new information from Sanofi Pasteur, suspended the dengue vaccination program. It also ordered the pharmaceutical company to pull Dengvaxia out of the Philippine market.So far, the DOH has acted with the necessary caution and done its part in providing the public, especially worried parents, with information. It has put up “fast lanes” where children who fell ill after receiving Dengvaxia can be prioritized for diagnosis and treatment, and families can be assisted with their hospital bills.To be sure, the DOH has plenty of other questions to answer. For instance, of the 162,000 who received Dengvaxia in Cebu last year, how many belonged to cities, towns or barangays where at least 70 percent had already tested positive for dengue fever? How many were seropositive, meaning they had had the dengue fever virus before, at the time they were vaccinated?Those were the two conditions the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended in a July 2016 position paper to guide countries that were considering the use of Dengvaxia. The WHO is set to release an updated position paper next month.The four vaccinated children who died this year in Cebu had no traces of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM), which meant that shortly before their deaths, they were not suffering from acute dengue fever nor could they be considered carriers of the virus. In Metro Manila, a task force from the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital has found that of 14 children whose deaths they had examined as of last month, three had contracted dengue fever despite having been vaccinated against the virus.There is a marked difference in the quality of the discussion on Dengvaxia when health officials are given the lead, instead of non-experts who seem hell-bent on stoking other people’s anger and anxiety over the issue. While waiting for health officials to provide additional guidance, local officials in Cebu’s cities and towns would be well-advised to keep an eye on the children who’ve received Dengvaxia in their communities, consult health experts, and sustain other preventive measures against the public health menace that is dengue fever.",sunstar

With the satellite market, eastern barangay residents did not have to travel to downtown Dagupan,” the city’s Public Information Office (PIO) said.In a letter dated March 25, Lim invited owners and operators of supermarkets, groceries, and convenience stores to put up rolling stores and sell basic commodities in the different barangays, subject to rules and regulations provided by the national and local governments.In a radio interview Friday, March 27, Lim said the City Government is also coordinating with pharmaceutical companies to sell medicines at the satellite market.The Municipal Government of Lingayen also placed a mobile market for its residents in Barangay Libsong West, which is now under extreme enhanced community quarantine following the death of a patient under investigation who is waiting for the Covid-19 result.The town’s Municipal Information Office reported on its Facebook page that the mobile market was placed at the entrance and exit point of the barangay, and the residents were asked to observe social distancing while buying goods.On his Facebook page, Mayor Liseldo “Dong” Calugay announced on Thursday that the residents need not go to the town proper as the municipal government will bring the mobile market to the interior barangays.He also asked for suggestions or comments on how to provide better services to their constituents.The Municipal Government of Bayambang started its mobile market on Friday.The barangays are clustered into districts for the schedule of the mobile market in their areas.“The mobile market aims to bring the needs of the people, especially those under total lockdown, to them to prevent them from overcrowding the public market and to limit the movement of people outside of their homes,” the Balon Bayambang official Facebook page post read.Some barangays in Bayambang were placed under total lockdown as the first case for Covid-19 was recorded in the town.Bugallon town Mayor Priscilla Espino, on her Facebook page, said the Municipal Government will implement the satellite market scheme to strengthen social distancing protocol in their public markets.“The vendors will go (to) the barangays to sell their products. The market schedule will still be followed and the satellite market will be at the covered courts. A dry-run was held in some barangays to see how it works,” she said.Meanwhile, Malasiqui town Mayor Noel Anthony Geslani, in his Executive Order No. 09, highly encouraged barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan officials to put up one mini retailing or satellite market in their respective communities.But peddling or selling of goods from place to place will not be allowed to reduce the possibility of virus transmission, he said.Two Covid-19 patients in the province are from Malasiqui town and are admitted at the Pangasinan Provincial Hospital in San Carlos City.

FRITZ ESPEDILLA,"January 18, 2016","DEAR Dr. Fritz,I hope you have a wonderful day. I am writing you because I am quite concerned with my friend's health condition. He has hepatitis B. I have heard that there is no cure for this. Is this true? Or is there a cure for hepatitis B? Please tell me more.Thank you and more blessings for you.Maritess K.*****Dear Maritess K.,Well, you heard it right. At the moment, there is really no cure for hepatitis B. That's the bad news. But, the good news, there might be some hope in the future. Let me count the ways.But, let me talk first about hepatitis B. This is a viral infection that attacks the liver. It is transmitted through contact with infected blood or bodily fluids and causes chronic liver infection, which may lead to life-threatening cirrhosis or liver cancer. And here's more bad news.According to the World Health Organization, there are an estimated 240 million people who are infected with hepatitis B for quite some time, and there are around 780,000 people who die from complications due to hepatitis B infection every year.Although a vaccine against the virus has been available since 1982, but, if you have it already, you have some real problem because if you are already infected with it, the treatment is limited. This is because the virus is able to dominate and prevail over the liver's self-preservation mechanism. What normally happens is, at the sign of infection, the liver will switch on a signal that tells the cells to self-destruct - so, to prevent further infection. The hepatitis B virus destroys this communications switch and tells the cells to ignore rather than fight the infection.Now, if there is less hepatitis B virus being produced, then there is less damage to the liver. So, let us just hope that your dear friend only got some of them. One of the good thing is, sometimes the drugs used for this disease can make the virus go away. Moreover, with all of the new exciting research today, there could be hope that someday, the complete cure will be found, especially for chronic hepatitis B. As long as there's flicker of hope, we should not just give up.Well, as much as there are more issues to talk to, then, let me finish this in my next issue. Until then!Dr. Fritz(Dr. Fritz Legarde Espedilla is an aesthetic dermatologist and surgeon and a clinical sexologist. She is also trained in hypnotherapy and Medical Acupuncture.

REYES,"January 06, 2021","THE City Government of Ormoc has allocated a P350-million budget for the purchase of vaccines against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as it aimed to inoculate its residents.While Mayor Richard Gomez said that he wants a 100-percent coverage of the city’s 240,000 population, he said the budget might initially cover around 80 percent, citing that “there will be other expenses like syringes, cotton, alcohol, storage, etc.”“There’s no need (for pre-registration). Our City Health Department already has the priority list ready and everybody on it will be inoculated unless they refuse,” Gomez said.According to City Councilor Lalaine Marcos, the mayor had already created the Ormoc City Covid-19 Task Force (Orcovac) “to help monitor and intensify efforts of the vaccination program, and tap private sources to help Ormoc achieve a 100 percent vaccination rate.”The Orcovac is composed of the mayor as chairman; Vice Mayor Leo Carmelo Locsin Jr. as vice chairman; Councilors Eusebio Gerardo Penserga, Peter Rodriguez, and Vincent Rama as members; and, city health doctor Edmund Kierulf, city administrator Vincent Emnas, city legal officer Joy Mejia Romero, city budget officer Sabrina Duero, city treasurer Delia Vilbar, city accountant Rosario Serafica, city social welfare and development officer Delia Corbo, city planning and development officer Raoul Cam, and infectious disease specialist Dr. Larsen Omolon, also as members.Citing the mayor, Marcos said the city government is already prepared with the list of those who are priority recipients of the vaccines with healthcare workers on top, followed by about 18,000 senior citizens, and those deemed highly vulnerable.“Mayor Gomez said that just like last year where a bulk of Ormoc’s budget was spent on Covid-19 prevention measures, to include the two rounds of one-sack per household distribution program to tide Ormocanons during the hard lockdown phase, the purchase of the vaccines will be this year’s priority,” Marcos said in a report.As more pharmaceuticals race to have their vaccines get emergency approval, Marcos said the mayor is confident that prices of vaccines will go down.For 2021, Ormoc has an approved annual budget of P1.6 billion.

REYES,"February 24, 2021","A TOP government official declared the Filipino farmers as the “new heroes” as the country is facing a crisis due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).John Castriciones, secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR), said it is high time that farmers get all the help that they need since they take the cudgel for the nation’s requirements at this time of the pandemic by “providing food on our table.”As he admired the farming sector for playing a major role, he said the farmers are the ones who are “keeping the country’s economy rolling.”Amidst the health crisis, the official said Filipinos can beat the pandemic by working together for the highly successful revolutionized farming system through the “Buhay sa Gulay” project.He hoped that the launching of the project will “arouse their interest and enthusiasm into farming.”Castriciones aid the project could help increase food productivity that “will redound for the benefit of our people.”“This is really a big help for us. We were taught about new farming methods to increase our harvests much unlike before when we just cleared a portion of the area and plant. We were taught how to prepare garden beds, unlike before we totally ignore such practices,” said Severino T. Sablay, 72, leader of one of the five teams working on the “New Greenland Farm” in Bagong Silangan, Quezon City.“We are seeing a great future here. We were taught the proper way of farming and spraying our plants with pesticides. Before, we just plant and then let them grow by themselves,” added Camilo Mendoza, 79.Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles, who is the concurrent chairman of the Task Force Zero Hunger, said hunger is worse than Covid-19.“At least Covid-19 can be cured by the vaccine. There is no vaccine for hunger,” Nograles said.According to the agency, everything is possible for as long as “people have visions.”“Before, ours was limited to backyard gardening. I’m glad that we have started urban farming and we are going to expand from seven hectares to 10 hectares. I just really want to thank Secretary John Castriciones for your support,” said Quezon City Joy Mayor Belmonte, who was reportedly awestruck by the success of the project.As this developed, the agency said it is intensifying the delivery of support services to all farmers “to offset the ill-effects of the pandemic.”Emily Padilla, the agency’s undersecretary for support services office, said there is a sense of urgency to provide the farming sector the much-needed assistance since it is the most vulnerable among all the sectors of the society.“They were already poor, if not the poorest among the poor, even before the pandemic had afflicted the country,” said Padilla during the distribution of Certificates of Land Ownership Award and the awarding of the P9.3-million package of support services in Santa Rosa, Nueva Ecija.According to the agency, the support services package included P1.81 million financial assistance to two farmers’ organizations, two light tractors worth P1.99 million and 75 hauling motorbikes worth P5.51 million.Padilla claimed in a statement that there are 13 million farmers all over the country who comprise 70 percent of the poorest of the poor in the rural areas.“Before the pandemic, poverty incidence in the farming sector was pegged at 34.4 percent, the highest in our society,” Padilla said.Citing a June 2020 report, the agency said the farmers registered 31.6 percent poverty incidence, followed by the fisherfolks, 26.2 percent, and the people residing in rural areas, 24.5 percent.“After the pandemic or because of the pandemic, I wonder how much the poverty incidence in the farming sector will be?” Padilla asked.To help keep it rolling, Padilla cited four types of support services that the agency is extending to all farmers regardless of whether they are identified as agrarian reform beneficiaries or not.These include the social infrastructure building, the livelihood enterprise development, the financial/credit assistance, and the climate-resilient farm productivity support project.According to Padilla, the social infrastructure building is the most important for it involves convincing all farmers to form or join various organizations for them to quickly avail of the three other types of services the government is coursing through these groups.The livelihood enterprise development, she said, involves off-farm livelihood assistance to augment household income, while financial/credit assistance is providing farmers financial capital for farm inputs, and the climate-resilient farm productivity support project refers to pieces of farm machinery delivered to them to make farming less burdensome.Meanwhile, the agency said they continue the distribution of land titles to farmer-beneficiaries.In Camarines Norte alone, the agency led in the distribution of 26 land titles to landless farmers from the province’s municipalities.DAR officers personally delivered the land titled right at the farm or at the doorsteps of the recipients.On infrastructure support, the agency said at least three new bridges, worth P22.5 million, are set to be constructed by the agency and the Public Works and Highways for farmers residing in agrarian reform communities in Ilocos Sur.The bridges would connect the agrarian reform communities and neighboring towns and barangays to market centers, the agency said.“These bridges will link our farmers to commercial areas where they can sell their produce. The goal is to allow our farmers to become more active participants in the local economy, and ultimately, to expand the reach and development of the country’s agriculture industry,” said Castriciones.The official also lauded the Congress Committee on Agrarian Reform for approving the New and Improved Agrarian Reform Program Bill, saying “it would greatly benefit the agricultural sector, particularly the agrarian reform beneficiaries under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program.”House Bill (HB) 5507, sponsored by Bataan Representative Geraldine Roman, is an act instituting the second phase of the agrarian reform program providing state subsidy in the acquisition and distribution of agricultural land to agrarian reform beneficiaries and creating the mechanisms for its implementation and other purposes.According to Castriciones, the bill “would resolve all the problems concerning the implementation of agrarian reform and provide improvement in the provision of support services to the farmers.”“HB No. 5507 would improve the current agrarian reform law so that we can implement it smoothly and quickly. Through this, we can avoid the previous mistakes which hampered the provision of services to the agrarian reform beneficiaries,” he added.“It is evident that they see the significance of agrarian reform in the improvement of the country’s agricultural sector. I believe that they also see that agrarian reform beneficiaries will play a vital role in securing our food supply, thus an improvement in the provision of support services for the farmers was proposed.” (SunStar Philippines)",sunstar

REYES,"September 26, 2020","THE extended community lockdowns brought by the coronavirus disease pandemic pushed some Filipinos to return to the centuries-old trading system: barter.“This is just one way of helping people. We are exchanging something without the need for money,” said Rhoel Ladera, a 42-year-old businessman in Tacloban City.“What’s worthless or not important to some may be a treasure to others,” added Ladera, who was able to barter four times in one month alone.As one of the online administrators of Tacloban Barter Community, Ladera reminded the over 95,000 members that “as long as both mutually agreed and are happy then a barter is successful.”“Every member has the right to define barter according to whatever books you read, but it is our right as group managers to define the mechanics of the virtual bartering in this group,” said the thriving barter community in the city.For himself, Ladera was able to barter his sunglasses for a sack of rice which he later donated to the frontliners; home-baked lasagna and cookies for a wireless internet router; sugar and water for a cooked shrimp; and a car for a small lot property.Minor setbackThe national government earlier announced that the bartering of goods is illegal unless it will be taxed.Citing a 2018 executive order signed by President Rodrigo Duterte, Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said that barter is only lawful in “limited” areas in Mindanao like in Siasi, Jolo; Sulu and Bonggao, Tawi-Tawi.“People must resort to regular transactions and pay the corresponding taxes,"" Lopez said in a press briefing in Manila in July.After his pronouncement sparked uproar among online barter enthusiasts, the official clarified his previous statement, saying that “personal transactions, not in the course of trade and business, are not covered by registration requirements.”Jen Garcia, an administrator of 17,000-strong Leyte Barter Community, said the government “may have the inherent powers to tax but it has to consider the cost versus the benefit.”According to Garcia, the government “should be happy that in spite of the financial hardship, Filipinos are creative enough to find ways to procure the basic needs without resorting to stealing and corruption.”The Global Barter Community, of which Tacloban Barter Community is a bonafide member, also issued a statement, saying that they “envision a world where kindness is without borders and humanity is defined by the extent with which every race can help one another to survive the global impact of the pandemic and adapt to the ‘new normal.’”“We stand in solidarity as different barter communities established by local stakeholders in common mission to promote barter as part of our way of life as Filipinos. We will strive to establish and redefine the traditional barter system as a new norm of helping one another and shall not in any way promote commercialism and materialism but positive values such as generosity, determination, honesty, patience, integrity, gender sensitivity, equality and ecological awareness,” it added.The barter community maintained that what it is doing “is not selling, for the goods or services are not exchanged based on price but value.”“It is not also donating for the goods are not given without anything in exchange,” it said.“The price of the item or service is never equal but the happiness and feeling of satisfaction should be equal,” the group added.Leyte-based historian Rolando Borrinaga said Filipinos still have the barter mentality in modern times.“We just remembered a lot of things about our culture during the lockdown. Many even started gardening. We do not have to make comparisons. The important thing now is that this crisis reminded us to go back to our history and culture in order to come to terms with our difficulties and to find sane explanations for what is happening,” Borrinaga said.‘God doesn’t barter’Amid the popular online barter activities, a Catholic priest reminded that barter is good but not ideal when it comes to Christian teaching and living.“In the Christian perspective of bartering, Jesus teaches us not to barter but to give, sometimes give until it hurts,” said Father Kim Margallo of St. Josemaria Escriva Mission Station in Tacloban.“I am not into bartering. I am into charity and generous giving,” Margallo told Sunstar Philippines.From an economic perspective, the priest maintained that there is nothing bad about bartering.But when it comes to the economy of God, Margallo echoed the teachings of Pope Francis, saying that God doesn’t barter.“He is the ultimate giver, the giver who does not require something in return. That is what we are supposed to do and whom we should imitate,” the priest said.Margallo reiterated that the church does not ask people to stop bartering.“Barter is not a sin. It is a personal decision to engage in it, as long as no law, rights and morality are violated. Even Jesus did not force the rich young man in the Gospel. To give and to be charitable is an individual’s decision, using his intellect and will,” he said.Charitable givingMargallo also reminded the Catholic faithful about charitable giving, saying that “we are asked to give and not expect something in return.”“We are just stewards of the earthly goods, and the instruction of the owner of the goods that we are administering and stewarding is to give,” he said.“In the end, the church teaches us to do charitable acts by giving to people who are in need, helping them not because you have something to give and in return, you demand something in exchange, but rather you give because you knew how it is to have nothing, and it is your responsibility to help those in need by virtue of our baptism,” added Margallo.According to him, the Church’s teaching on bartering is based on teaching charity and generosity by “giving out of love not out of need.” (SunStar Philippines)",sunstar

""We don't have a government hospital, only a rural health center with one doctor.""A community hospital in Dolores has been dilapidated since last year, and has not been repaired, he said. The next government hospital is in Tacloban City, which is at least a four-hour drive.Covid-19 came at a time when the localities have not even completely recovered from the onslaught of Typhoons Yolanda and Ruby, which struck a year apart.While the government was still on post-Yolanda operations, Ruby came in November 2014 and caused severe damage to homes, crops and farmlands that were still being rehabilitated. There was not enough public attention in the aftermath of Ruby as Yolanda was still fresh in the minds of government officials as well as the general public.""Lahat ng hanapbuhay namin nawala (All our sources of livelihood were destroyed),"" said Rio Caspe, 42, a fisherman from Barangay San Francisco in Sulat whose house was destroyed by Typhoon Ruby.His three children and wife had to rely on the meager earnings of their small sari-sari store as massive flooding made fishing difficult.Caspe said his neighbors were also cash-strapped because their crops such as banana, rice and copra were destroyed by the typhoon.""We only relied on relief goods while staying in an evacuation center,"" said Caspe.Funds depletedDolores, a third-class municipality, earmarked P8 million in calamity funding for 2020 to prepare and protect its 42,000 people or 12,700 families from the impact of natural calamities.However, the funds had to be realigned to buy personal protective equipment (PPE) for community volunteers as well as hygiene kits and food packs for residents during the lockdown, which was imposed to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The national government's Bayanihan fund gave Dolores a P14-million subsidy to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.""We are now sourcing from this (Bayanihan) fund for our response to Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Catuday.The town also has to spend for at least 900 LSIs or locally stranded individuals who arrived in Dolores from March to June.Dolores, Sulat, and seven other towns in Samar were placed under state of calamity in May when Typhoon Ambo, the first typhoon to visit the country this year, pummeled the province. As usual, the storm destroyed crops and damaged houses, displacing more than 140,000 people.Most houses in these towns are made of light materials.""Matagal bago kami makabangon, hirap kasi ang pagpapagawa (It takes a long time to recover because we don't have enough money to repair our houses),"" said Catuday.Charlie Rosaroso, head of the Sulat MDRRMO, said at least P1.5 million or 30 percent of the P5.1 million calamity fund for 2020 was spent to provide emergency assistance to families affected by Typhoon Ambo. The remaining funds were depleted by the Covid-19 response.He said he was only able to spare P300,000 to continue the training for volunteers on emergency response.Provinces and cities get five percent of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), the local governments' share of national tax collections, for disaster risk resilience (DRR) under Republic Act 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010.Of the total calamity fund, 70 percent is allocated to prevention, mitigation and preparedness, and 30 percent is set aside as a Quick Response Fund (QRF).""What is left of our calamity fund is now being used for our Covid-19 response,"" said Rosaroso. These include relief goods, PPE for volunteers, hygiene kits, food packs for residents, as well as LSIsand ROFs (returning overseas Filipinos) undergoing quarantine.Sulat has hosted close to 200 LSIs since March.A fourth-class municipality with a population of close to 16,000, Sulat does not have a hospital, but there is one doctor in each of the rural health centers in 18 barangays, said Rosaroso.As of August 10, there were eight confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection in Eastern Samar and most of them came from Metro Manila. Both Catuday and Rosaroso said there were no confirmed cases in their towns, as they work even on Sundays to ensure health and hygiene protocols are properly implemented.Mario Candelaria, chairman of Barangay San Francisco in Sulat, said: ""An infection here is a nightmare because we don't have a hospital.""""Noon 'pag galing Maynila sinasalubong ng mga taga dito, ngayon nilalayuan na (Before, those who arrived from Manila got a welcome, now people avoid them,"" said Candelaria.He said the P110,000 calamity fund of San Francisco has also been used for food packs, hygiene kits, and for disinfecting public facilities.Exposed and vulnerableThe Philippines ranked second in terms of exposure and vulnerability to climate-related risks in the Global Climate Change Risk Report for 2020 of Germanwatch, the environment think tank. Japan topped the list.Red Constantino, executive director of the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities (ICSC), said the report showed that ""Those who are least responsible for the problem, are the ones who are suffering the most. This is unacceptable.""""The pandemic has largely revealed systemic weaknesses that would have just taken more time to uncover otherwise,"" said Constantino.The German report noted that strong tropical cyclones such as Bopha (""Pablo"") 2012, Haiyan (""Yolanda"") 2013 and Mangkhut (""Ompong"") 2018 have been recorded in the last 10 years, affecting mostly the poor and vulnerable population.At least 74 percent of the country's population is susceptible to multiple hazards, including coastal hazards such as typhoons, storm surges and rising sea levels, according to the 2018 World Risk Report. The report ranked the Philippines third among countries most vulnerable to disaster risks.The catastrophic impact of Tropical Depression Ondoy in 2009 cost Marikina and Pasig cities P22.54 billion, of which Pasig accounted for 90 percent.Rich city gets more moneyThis time around, Pasig City had to let go of critical spending for disaster risk resilience programs due to the pandemic response, said Bryant Wong, the city disaster risk reduction and management officer. These included reducing the number of fire engines and rescue vehicles to be purchased.""We did not expect Covid-19 pandemic to affect us all, but we need to respond to it the best way we can,"" Wong said.Unlike Sulat and Dolores, however, Pasig City Hall has deeper pockets and generous donors.Of the P600-million calamity fund for 2020, the City Government has spent half for the Covid-19 pandemic response, Wong said.It also managed to utilize an additional P200 million from the P300 million DRR savings in the last five years.Other funding sources for Pasig City's Covid-19 response included a P1.2-billion supplemental fund for the Social Amelioration Program (SAP) and another P1.2 billion for tablets to be used by students for online classes, from the Special Education Fund.The city also received P136 million from the Bayanihan fund, equivalent to one month of its IRA.Wong said private donations of beds, PPEs, hygiene kits and rapid testing kits worth P50 million boosted the city's pandemic response.The private sector also donated 100,000 food packs to Pasig.In the case of Sulat and Dolores towns, there are no big corporate donors, which meant that the money for food packs distributed to locked-down residents came from their calamity funds.Funding sourcesUndersecretary Ricardo Jalad of the Office of Civil Defense, also the executive director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council Council (NDRRMC), told local government units (LGUs) in a webinar in July to learn ""to adjust, transform and adapt strategies to manage response to Covid-19 pandemic and prepare for multiple hazards from natural calamities.""During the webinar, John Aries Macaspac, a director of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), enumerated funding sources for the Covid-19 response, including the Special DRRM Trust Fund or the savings from DRR funds in the last five years, a month's worth of IRA from the national government and realigned funds from the General Fund. LGUs may also use 20 percent of their development funds for the purchase of PPEs, rapid test kits, vitamins, medicines, accommodation and expenses of health workers, construction of rental quarantine facilities, mobile testing labs, tents, shelters for the homeless, and training for pandemic response, under guidelines issued by the DBM and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).The ""Bayanihan to Heal as One"" or Republic Act 11469 allocated P37 billion for the emergency Covid-19 response of LGUs. It allocated P12.4 billion to all cities, P18.39 billion to municipalities and P6.2 billion to provinces.Constantino said responses to the Covid-19 pandemic and climate emergency should go hand in hand, as both require the expertise of scientists and policies and actions based on evidence.Scientists, he noted, advised physical distancing to prevent the transmission Covid-19 while waiting for a vaccine to be developed. Scientists have also stressed the urgency of limiting the rise of global temperatures to below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.""We do not have the luxury to choose whether we need protection from the deadly fevers induced by the novel coronavirus or from an increasingly feverish planet. Just as climate change is not an environmental problem but a development crisis, so is Covid-19 not merely a human health crisis but an ecological problem,"" said Constantino.

As of March, 214 countries have been hit by the disease, killing 17,853 people.The symptoms of H1N1 include fever, headache, fatigue, muscle or joint pains, lack of appetite, runny nose, sore throat and cough. And in some cases, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting may be present too.In 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) called for an international solidarity to provide fair and equitable access to the vaccines for all countries. To date, the WHO has helped secure significant donations from its partners and developed countries for the developing nations.The WHO's goal is to provide each of these countries that have requested for donations with enough vaccines to immunize at least 10% of its population. The Philippines has 9.1 million doses of the vaccine.H1N1 vaccine will protect humans against A(H1N1) influenza, but this will not prevent illnesses caused by other influenza virus. There are two types of vaccines: Vaccines may be monovalent or polyvalent. A monovalent vaccine is designed to immunize against a single antigen or single microorganism. A polyvalent vaccine is designed to immunize against two or more strains of the same microorganism, or against two or more microorganisms.In certain cases a monovalent vaccine may be preferable for rapidly developing a strong immune response. Commercial monovalent vaccines are available for P300. (with Anna Carlyn Lim, Ateneo de Zamboanga intern)",sunstar
