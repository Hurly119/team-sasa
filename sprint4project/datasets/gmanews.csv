Kumaran said discussions are ongoing as Bharat Biotech awaits emergency use authorization (EUA) for Covaxin, its COVID-19 vaccine, from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

“There are ongoing conversations for a supply for Covaxin which can range anywhere from 8 million doses upwards. I don’t think we are in a position to be signing anything yet,” he said in an ANC interview.

Kumaran clarified that formal negotiations have not yet begun as Bharat Biotech only submitted its Phase 3 clinical trial data to the FDA on Tuesday.

“The company has had one or two presentations with the FDA, but the commercial negotiations, which involve signing of a term sheet and then eventually moving to a contract, those are still pending,” he said.

“Once we close the contract, the nature of the vaccine requires at least 45 days for the production to be completed. We could look at 8 to 20 million over the next year and a half, but how much of that will come early is actually the big question,” he added.

Bharat Biotech filed an application for EUA on January 21.

Covaxin showed 81% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19.

The FDA has so far granted EUA to the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac.—AOL, GMA News

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also received a shot of Sinovac's vaccine at the PGH.
The ceremony -- one among several symbolic vaccinations scheduled within the day -- was held in a bid to boost public confidence in the vaccination program in light of polls showing low trust in vaccines.  
Several government officials, including Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Eric Domingo and testing czar Secretary Vince Dizon also received the Sinovac shot. Dizon received his at Tala Hospital (Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium) in Caloocan City.
Under the vaccination priority list, frontline workers in health facilities should be the first to get inoculated. 
The “symbolic” vaccination followed the arrival of 600,000 Sinovac doses on Sunday afternoon. 
The first batch of vaccines will be rolled out to several hospitals in Metro Manila also on Monday, marking a turning point in the country’s battle against COVID-19.
Aside from PGH, the priority hospitals for vaccination are the Lung Center of the Philippines, Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium (Tala Hospital), PNP General Hospital, Pasig City General Hospital, and the V. Luna Medical Center.
Only 180 of the 1,165 surveyed at the Tala Hospital expressed interest in the Sinovac vaccine. The hospital chief said a contingency plan is in place to avoid wastage. 
The Department of Health has assured health workers that the vaccine is “safe” and “beneficial” for them as it can reduce morbidity and mortality linked to COVID-19. 
Citing data from the Sinovac’s dossier, an epidemiologist also said the Chinese vaccine showed 100% efficacy against severe COVID-19. 
The government aims to secure 148 million doses to vaccinate 70 million Filipinos this year. 
Only the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have been approved for emergency use by the FDA.

""We have been asking the world for more funding... for UNICEF and our distribution to countries we still need about $1 billion,"" UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said at Dubai's World Government Summit, held virtually this year.
That funding could be used strengthen health systems in poorer nations and support the distribution of vaccines there, she said.

Dr. Rontgene Solante noted that the Sinovac shot yielded 50.4% efficacy among health workers attending to COVID-19 patients in Brazil, where cases are higher.
“If you are here in the Philippines, in which the attack rate is not as high as that during the trial conducted in Brazil, then it might have a better efficacy here in the Philippines,” he said at a briefing.
Solante also said that immunogenicity, a foreign substance’s ability to provoke an immune response, increased slightly when the interval between the first and second dose was lengthened from 14 days to four weeks.
“So I am banking on that, with this vaccine, since this will be rolled out in the Philippines, we may have a better protection compared to doon sa nakikita natin sa Brazilian study,” he said.

“Gusto po talaga niya Sinopharm,” Roque said during the Palace briefing.
“Eh kaso nga, wala pa pong EUA, kaya ayaw noong mga doktor, mga eksperto,” he added.
EUA is emergency use authorization issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which is needed for a vaccine to be legally administered in the country.

FDA Director General Eric Domingo also said on Wednesday that Sinopharm, a Chinese COVID-19 vaccine, has yet to apply for an EUA. 
“Wala pa pong application sa 'min,” Domingo said during the Laging Handa briefing. 
“Hindi po namin hinaharang [ang application ng Sinopharm for EUA],” he added.
The FDA however approved the compassionate use of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for the benefit of Presidential Security Group (PSG) members, the Palace said last week. It was Duterte who first revealed in December 2020 that members of the military and the PSG already got vaccinated with the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine even if the FDA had yet to issue either an EUA or a permit for compassionate use for this vaccine at that time. PSG commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III confirmed the President’s statement, even saying that they inoculated themselves with the unregistered Sinopharm vaccine.
Roque, however, did not categorically deny Tulfo’s claim that the President had talked to a Sinopharm representative identified as John Boja because the Chief Executive wants to secure their vaccine.
“I am not belying Mon Tulfo. That is his article (The Manila Times column),” Roque said.

Blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine neutralized an engineered version of the virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike portion of the highly contagious P.1 variant first identified in Brazil, the study conducted by scientists from the companies and the University of Texas Medical Branch found.
The scientists said the neutralizing ability was roughly equivalent the vaccine's effect on a previous less contagious version of the virus from last year.
The spike, used by the virus to enter human cells, is the primary target of many COVID-19 vaccines.
In previously published studies, Pfizer had found that its vaccine neutralized other more contagious variants first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, although the South African variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the vaccine.

The vaccine’s efficacy rate among healthy individuals aged 18 to 59, meanwhile, ranges from 65.3% to 91%.
“Our understanding is that there may have been some information that was shared with the FDA in the Philippines that made it necessary for the Philippines’ FDA to decide on this limited use of vaccines in the 18 to 59 year age group,” Abeyasinghe said.

The bill further states that provinces, cities and municipalities may procure or accept donations only in cooperation with the Department of Health and National Task Force through a multiparty agreement, which shall include the DOH and the relevant supplier or donor of COVID-19 vaccine.
""These LGUs shall procure no more than 50% of their target population for vaccination.

The statement was issued after the World Health Organization (WHO) approved two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 for emergency use and are available for global distribution.
COVAX also said that in order for the doses to be delivered via the first allocation round, the following critical pieces must be in places:
All facility participants must have given national regulatory authorization for the vaccines in question, a process which can be expedited by issuing special authorizations for use based on granting of WHO Emergency Use Listing.
All facility participants must have signed indemnity agreements with the manufacturers in question in order to receive doses through COVAX.
Advance Market Commitment-eligible economies must have submitted National Deployment and Vaccination Plans through the COVID-19 Partners Platform, that have then been reviewed and validated by COVAX.

“As participants fulfil the criteria and finalize readiness preparations, COVAX will issue purchase orders to the manufacturer and ship and deliver doses via an iterative process. This means deliveries for this first round of allocation will take place on a rolling basis and in tranches,” it said.
“Due the high number of doses available as well as the high number of countries getting ready for delivery in Q1 2021, the capacity of supplier and freight forwarders will be under considerable pressure. Shipment timelines will be impacted by logistical preparedness and delivery lead times, which may vary depending on the location of the receiving participant,” it added.
The WHO earlier said the Philippines’ indemnity plan is now in the hands of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Pfizer.
The COVAX Facility is expected to send more than 100,000 doses of Pfizer BioNTech vaccines to the country once the firm signs off on the Philippines indemnification measures.
The country's lack of an indemnification law—a measure ensuring compensation for individuals who develop serious side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine—has delayed the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Philippines.
At a Senate panel hearing last week, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have been delivered to the country as early as February 12 if the Philippines had its own indemnification law.

Senator Sonny Angara, Finance committee chair, sponsored Tuesday the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act and sought its swift approval.
He said the bill seeks to authorize the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.
It also allows local government units to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through multiparty agreements.
The LGUs will be allowed to make advance payments but they can only purchase vaccines and supplies for up to 50% of their target population. The 50% cap may be adjusted by the IATF depending on the supply.

Angara said, as proposed by Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, LGUs must give due priority to frontline healthworkers, senior citizens, and indigent persons. They will also be required to exercise transparency and report any supply or purchase agreement they will enter.
He added, as recommended by Senator Joel Villanueva, the bill states the LGUs have to submit a masterlist of the names and profiles of their constituents who are eligible to receive vaccines.
“While there is roughly P82.5 billion that has been appropriated in 2021 for our national immunization program against COVID-19, we are adding more to this fund by allowing LGUs to use whatever resources they have to purchase vaccines and related supplies,” the senator said.
“By allowing LGUs to take an active part in the procurement of vaccines, we also increase the volumes that we are purchasing, which in turn would allow the national government, particularly the office of our vaccine czar Sec. Charlie Galvez, to negotiate for more affordable prices,” he added.
Under the bill, private entities, in cooperation with the DOH and NTF, will also be allowed to purchase vaccines for their own use through a multiparty agreement.
The bill also states that purchases of COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies for their storage, transport, and distribution will be exempted from customs duties, value-added tax (VAT), excise tax, donor’s tax, and other fees and charges.
“This is to complement the exemptions provided in the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act or CREATE which is awaiting the signature of the President,” said Angara.
The Finance committee chair said the measure also seeks to establish a COVID-19 National Indemnity Fund, as proposed by the Department of Finance, which shall only be used to compensate any inoculated person who will experience severe adverse effect or worse death.
“This fund will be worth P500 million. And as suggested by Minority Floor Leader Drilon, it will be sourced from the Contingent Fund and shall be administered by PhilHealth,” he said.
The bill also contains provision for the creation of Vaccine Passport Program. Vaccination passports will be issued by the Department of Health to individuals who have been inoculated and will contain basic information about the person, as well as the brand of vaccine used and the date of inoculation.
Angara said since the passports are intended to be digital, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) will be mandated to develop the needed digital systems and applications. But because of the digital divide in the country, the passports will also be available as printed documents.
“These passports will serve as documentary proof that a person has completed a full round of COVID-19 vaccinations, which could then allow them to go abroad to wherever they are permitted, engage in non-essential domestic travel, to grant them quick passage through local checkpoints, and even access to business establishments,” the senator said.
He said a special task group composed of medical and vaccine experts will be established to conduct post-vaccination monitoring of patients.
“This is to ensure a quick response in case there are any who might experience serious adverse side effects after being vaccinated,” he said.
The bill also authorizes the Health Technology Assessment Council or HTAC to make recommendations to the DOH and PhilHealth about COVID-19 vaccines based on preliminary Phase III clinical trials, but only when the relevant vaccine manufacturer has been issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“The development of COVID-19 vaccines in such a short amount of time is in itself a huge scientific achievement. But that alone will not end this pandemic.  That alone will not bring things back to normal,” said Angara.
“To achieve that, we will need nothing less than the whole nation acting together. All sectors of society, all levels of government, all our policies, all our regulations, all our systems need to be aligned and properly synced. Every part will need to act harmoniously.  In the end, we won’t just be injecting vaccines. We’ll be injecting hope—which is perhaps the single-most important ingredient to our recovery as a nation,” he added.—AOL, GMA News",GMA News

Expert answers,JOVILAND RITA,2021-02-23 16:37:00,"A health expert on Tuesday addressed several myths and misconceptions, and also provided advice, on COVID-19 vaccinations.
In a forum organized by the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP) and Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Kathryn Uy Roa said that COVID-19 vaccines were not for everyone.
“This is a fact,” Roa added.
However, she emphasized that the only contraindications against the vaccines were allergic reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine and any of its components.
Patients who experienced an immediate allergic reaction, whether mild like rashes or severe like anaphylaxis, to a vaccine's first dose should not receive the second dose.

“Myth No. 2: ‘I have allergies to other vaccines and injectable medications, therefore I cannot get the vaccine.’ So this is false. You need further evaluation by an allergist,” said Roa.
Those who had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injected therapy should be evaluated by an allergist to assess possible allergic reactions to some components of COVID-19 vaccines.
For people with allergies to food and medication, Roa said that they can receive COVID-19 vaccines.
“’I have allergies to food and or medication, therefore I cannot get the COVID-19 vaccines.’ So this is false. These are the special groups who can receive the COVID-19 vaccines.”
Roa added that patients suffering from immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases as well as well-controlled asthma may also get a COVID-19 vaccine.
Pregnant
“’I'm pregnant, therefore I cannot get the COVID-19 vaccines.’ This issue needs to be discussed with a doctor. There's very limited data on the effect of vaccines on pregnant women and their babies,” she said.
Roa noted that no safety concerns were flagged in the small group of women included in the vaccine trials as well as in animal studies.
She advised pregnant women to consider the following in deciding whether or not to get vaccinated against COVID-19:
level of COVID-19 community transmission
patient’s personal risk of contracting COVID-19
risk of COVID-19 to the parent and potential risks to the fetus
efficacy of the vaccine
side effects of the vaccines
lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy.
For lactating mothers, Roa said that there was limited data on the matter but the vaccine without a live virus was unlikely to pose a risk to a breastfeeding child.

It also allows local government units to procure COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through multiparty agreements.
Moreover, a COVID-19 National Indemnity Fund, to be administered by PhilHealth, will also be established under the measure to compensate any inoculated person who will experience permanent disability, hospital confinement, or death.
A P500 million will be authorized to augment the funds of PhilHealth for this purpose, to be sourced from the contingent fund under the 2021 General Appropriations Act.
Zubiri said that with the passage of the measure, the job of procuring the COVID-19 vaccines is now in the hands of the executive branch.
""We are not remiss in our job as legislators. Ginawa na natin ang lahat. Ang bola ay nasa korte na ng ehekutibo,"" he said.

Senator Bong Go, Duterte's former special assistant, earlier said Duterte believed that MGCQ was not in the best interest of the country.
""No vaccine rollout, no MGCQ muna -PRRD,"" Go said in a message to reporters.
Go said the President also told Education Secretary Leonor Briones that he is not ready to allow the resumption of face to face classes.
Duterte was quoted as saying that he cannot, in his conscience, ""allow these things to happen.""
The President also expressed confidence that the Filipino people and the economic managers will understand the situation, Go said.
The National Economic Development Authority has proposed placing the entire Philippines under the MGCQ starting March 1 supposedly to balance the country's response to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the need of Filipinos to start earning and spending.
However, Dr. Guido David of the OCTA Research Team said the government could be taking a costly risk if the entire Philippines would be  placed under MGCQ.
Navotas Mayor Toby Tiangco earlier said that majority of the mayors in Metro Manila are in favor of putting the region under MGCQ next month.

The WHO official said the Philippines had requested 900,000 doses of Pfizer's vaccine and low dead space syringes.
Low dead space syringes ensure less wastage per vial. It can make five-dose vials yield one more or six doses.
No law, no delivery
The country's lack of an indemnification law—a measure ensuring compensation for individuals who develop serious side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine—has delayed the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Philippines.
At a Senate panel hearing last week, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have been delivered to the country as early as February 12 if the Philippines had its own indemnification law.
The Philippines is expected to receive at least 5.6 million doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines within the first quarter of 2021, with the initial batch of 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines arriving this month.
Galvez has been calling on Congress to pass an indemnification law, which he said is required by COVAX, the globally-pooled vaccine procurement and distribution effort co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
Indemnification deal
With the law still being crafted in Congress, the Philippine government proposed an  agreement with Pfizer-BioNTech that would ensure compensation for Filipinos who will experience serious side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
“As reported by Sec. Galvez, our vaccine czar, the indemnification agreement with Pfizer is being reviewed by our team and should be finalized in a few days,” National Task Force Against COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon said in a message to reporters.
“This will allow us to complete the documents needed for the delivery of the 117,000 Pfizer doses from the COVAX facility,” he added.
Bills have been filed in Congress for the creation of an indemnity mechanism but presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said President Rodrigo Duterte would not immediately certify them as urgent.
No certification as urgent
He said that certifying proposed measures as urgent did not guarantee quick passage into law by Congress.
“Ang mas importante ay ang mensahe ng Presidente sa Kongreso na ito po ay urgent at priority ng administration dahil kung wala ito ay baka maantala ang pagdating ng bakuna galing sa Covax facility,” Roque said on Friday.

According to Sandra Aguinaldo’s report on “24 Oras,” Goffin said the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, which was supposed to arrive last week, has no connection with the EU’s new export control regulation.
“For the Philippines and many other countries, this export license will not apply for the COVAX Initiative which is very relevant to the Philippines because the first Pfizer vaccine will arrive very soon under the COVAX Initiative,” Goffin said.
The Belgian government earlier disclosed a new procedure that pharmaceutical firms will have to take when requesting a license to export COVID-19 vaccines outside of the EU.
According to the Belgian government, securing an export license will enhance transparency in vaccine delivery and will be required until March 31, 2021.

Goffin said the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines will not be affected by the new regulation as this was from the COVAX Initiative.
The COVAX initiative is a global collaboration of manufacturers and experts that seeks to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
COVAX is co-led by GAVI vaccines alliance, the World Health Organization, and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It aims to deliver two billion doses of effective, approved COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.
However, Goffin said COVID-19 vaccines that will be bought from Pfizer outside the COVAX Initiative will undergo the export control regulation.
“It’s the nature of Belgium and the European Union to have as many countries having access to vaccines because this is a worldwide crisis and we have to address it globally. I can assure you that the European Union, Belgium, are really ready to help countries, including the Philippines, to get out of this mess,” he said.

According to the Department of Health, the COVAX facility will provide COVID-19 vaccines to 20 percent of the country’s population but only those for 15 percent will be free. Vaccines for the remaining five percent will be paid by the government.
Galvez, however, assured the public that the decrease in the allocation of free vaccines from the COVAX facility would not be a problem, saying the government could still secure additional doses at a reasonable price.
Pruce said the United Kingdom had funded 548 million pounds into the COVAX facility that will help distribute COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries throughout 2021.

According to Lei Alviz’s report on “24 Oras Weekend” on Sunday, the Philippine Food and Drug Administration found that the Sinovac vaccine had an efficacy rate of 65% to 91% for healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old.
However, the FDA did not recommend the Sinovac jab for senior citizens.
“Unfortunately, most of the vaccines that are currently issued an EUA have little data as far as the elderly are concerned, lalo na ‘yong sa young people. So we really have to generate the evidence to be able to show its efficacy in this particular age groups,” Department of Science and Technology–Philippine Council for Health Research Development Executive Director Jaime Montoya said.

In early February, Sinovac said late-stage trial data of its COVID-19 vaccine from Brazil and Turkey showed it prevented hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients, but had a much lower efficacy rate in blocking infections.
The 12,396-person trial found the CoronaVac vaccine was 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 sufferers from being hospitalized or dying and 83.7% effective in avoiding cases that required any medical treatment, but only 50.65% effective at keeping people from getting infected, according to a statement. —  Ma.

“(I) seek your approval...to be the first person to be vaccinated in the City of San Juan. The undersigned is volunteering in order to increase the trust and confidence of our citizens in the vaccination process and to encourage them to have themselves inoculated as well,” he said.

He said this is still far from their target of 70% or 85, 526 people to achieve herd immunity.
He further said that he personally feels that through volunteering to be the first to be inoculated and showing people that the vaccine is indeed safe and effective “would be a big boost towards this goal.”
“This will convince more people to get vaccinated and therefore increase the number of registrants before the actual rollout,” said Zamora.
Present during the visit were National Action Plan Against COVID -19 deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon, National Economic and Development Authority Acting Secretary Karl Chua, and Metropolitan Manila Develo(pment Authority chairman Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr.

Some common-cold antibodies might help fight COVID-19
Antibodies to the six coronaviruses that cause common colds cannot ""neutralize"" the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but antibodies to two of them might at least help the body fend off severe illness from the new virus, a small preliminary study suggests.
German researchers studied 60 patients with COVID-19, including 25 who were hospitalized but not critically ill, 19 who required intensive care unit admission, and 25 who did not get sick enough to be hospitalized.
The patients who needed intensive care all had significantly lower levels of antibodies to two seasonal coronaviruses, HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1, which the authors said are more closely related to the COVID-19 virus compared to the other human coronaviruses.

The vaccines' temporary side effects can include swollen lymph nodes around the armpits, which could be misread as a possible sign of breast cancer if it turns up on a mammogram.
So-called axillary lymphadenopathy is usually seen in only 0.02%-0.04% of screening mammograms, according to the Society's guidelines.
In trials of the Moderna vaccine, the condition developed in 11.6% of participants after the first dose and in 16% after the second dose.
Researchers testing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine did not routinely ask participants about armpit tenderness and lymph node swelling, but some people reported this side effect, which lasted an average of 10 days.
More subtle effects on lymph nodes that are evident only on X-rays are likely to last longer, the Society said, although it is not clear yet what vaccination-related lymph node changes would look like.
""As more information about the incidence and appearance of axillary lymphadenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination becomes available, it may be appropriate to change the duration of follow-up or final assessment recommendations,"" the Society said. -- Reuters",GMA News

Dr. Eric Tayag, director IV of the DOH  Knowledge Management and Information Technology Service said based on the latest information they received, people recovering from the disease will have to delay inoculation for at least six months.
“The latest information we have is that those who are recovering from COVID-19 infection, they have to delay receiving the vaccination and there’s information that this should be at least six months,” he said in a webinar.
“While we have this information, such policies will be evaluated and that there will be announcements if those who had COVID-19 can actually receive the vaccine,” Tayag added.
According to the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, individuals who already contracted COVID-19 and have recovered should still be vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine due to the severe health risks associated with the virus and the fact that reinfection is possible.

Researchers reported on Friday in mBio that among 50 COVID-19 patients under the age of 42 who had received the MMR II as children, the higher their titers -- or levels -- of so-called IgG antibodies produced by the vaccine and directed against the mumps virus in particular, the less severe their symptoms.
People with the highest mumps antibody titers had asymptomatic COVID-19. More research is needed to prove the vaccine prevents severe COVID-19.

Likewise, AstraZeneca’s price range is cheaper at $3 to $4 compared with American firms Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, which also has COVID-19 vaccines that have over 90% effectivity but cost more due to the requirement of an ultra cold storage.
AstraZeneca, however, has admitted that the initial results of its COVID-19 candidate vaccine still needs to be evaluated following concerns raised by experts that it had to reduce its first dose to half since administering two doses in full only resulted in 62% efficacy.

In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, from where a worrying variant has spread.
A high bar has been set by two authorized vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which were around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal trials when given in two doses.
Those trials, however, were conducted mainly in the United States and before new variants emerged.
The top US infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said the variations in effectiveness around the world underlined the need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible to prevent new variants from emerging.

""It's really a wake up call for us to be nimble and to be able to adjust as this virus will continue for certain to evolve,"" Fauci said.
J&J's main goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization.
That ""will potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,"" Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said of the results, which were based on 468 symptomatic cases.
Seeking approval
J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration next week. It has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses in 2021 and will produce the vaccine in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India.
Public health officials are counting on the J&J vaccine to increase much-needed supply and simplify immunization in the United States, which has a deal to buy 100 million doses of J&J's vaccine and an option for an additional 200 million.
J&J said the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval, but Stoffels declined to say how many doses.
""Right now, any protection and additional vaccine is great. The key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,"" Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said.
Michael Breen, Director of Infectious Diseases and Ophthalmology at research firm GlobalData said ""Most countries are still desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the vaccine is considered highly effective. Moderately effective will do just fine for now.""
None of the vaccine recipients in the J&J trial died from COVID-19, compared with 5 in the placebo group, the National Institutes of Health said. Three deaths in the vaccine group overall, but none were determined to be from the virus. That compares with 16 deaths overall in the placebo arm, it added.
Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, J&J's does not require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world where transportation and cold storage are an issue.
South African variant
Several studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant has mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing their efficacy.
""What we are learning is there is different efficacy in different parts of the world,"" Stoffels told Reuters.
In a sub-study of 6,000 volunteers in South Africa, Stoffels said, the J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease. In the South Africa portion of the trial, 95% of cases were infections with the South African variant.
""I am overwhelmed by the fact that this vaccine protected against severe disease even in South Africa,"" said Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of the South African vaccine trial.
Gray, who is the chief executive of the South African Medical Research Council, said this is by far the best vaccine for South Africa to fight the mutant strain and can prevent a large number of hospitalizations and deaths.
A mid-stage trial of a Novovax coronavirus vaccine in South Africa also showed lower efficacy, proving to be 60% effective among volunteers who didn't have HIV. In a separate, late-stage trial in Britain it was 89.3% effective.
In the J&J trial, which was conducted in eight countries, 44% of participants were from the United States, 41% from Central and South America and 15% from South Africa. Slightly more than a third of the volunteers were over 60.
J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response, whereas the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA). — Reuters",GMA News

It quoted an AstraZeneca spokesperson as saying in a statement that the ""standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data.”
The study is testing a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and University of Oxford researchers at sites including the United States and the United Kingdom, where the adverse event was reported.
The nature of the safety issue and when it happened were not immediately known, although the participant is expected to recover, according to Stat News.
The report said suspension of the trial was having an impact on other AstraZeneca vaccine trials - as well as on clinical trials being conducted by other vaccine makers.
Nine leading US and European vaccine developers pledged on Tuesday to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their experimental vaccines despite the urgency to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
The companies, including AstraZeneca, Pfizer Inc and GlaxoSmithKline, issued what they called a ""historic pledge"" after a rise in concern that safety standards might slip in the face of political pressure to rush out a vaccine.
The companies said they would ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals of the first COVID-19 vaccines."".

“Well, nandyan po ang posibilidad. Hindi naman siguro October kundi by end of the year,” he said.
According to Domingo, the Phase 3 trial can be finished in two to three months.
“Kapag may mga nakita tayo, depende sa resulta, makita talaga na safe and effective after the Phase 3, then it’s really possible na before the end of the year meron nang bakuna na magpaparehistro, hindi lang sa Pilipinas kundi sa ibang mga bansa,” he said.

On Wednesday, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said there is still no certainty if vaccine will be available locally by December despite the development in Russia regarding a COVID-19 vaccine
“Hindi pa po natin masabi kasi nasa Phase 3 pa lang ng clinical trials. Makikita po natin kung paano magpo-progress ito,” she said.
On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia became the first country in the world to approve a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, calling it Sputnik V.
Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte said he had accepted Putin's offer to provide the country with a vaccine against COVID-19 and that he is willing to try it for himself during clinical trials.
Citing information from a meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO), Domingo said that there were doubts on how Russia jumped to the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Ang huling update natin ay sa Russia mukhang nasa Phase 2 clinical trial pa lamang at patapos pa lamang. Kaya siguro nagulat din ang buong mundo na biglang kine-claim nila na approved na,” he said.
""Hindi natin alam kung ano 'yung approval process na nangyari sa Russia or baka talagang nag-approve na sila after Phase 2 o kung talagang na-complete nila 'yung Phase 3,’ he added.
Domingo said the FDA will get more information about the approval of the Sputnik V vaccine.
Vergeire also said that government will still subject the Russia-made vaccine against COVID-19 to regulatory procedures before clearing it for clinical trials.
Side effects
Meanwhile, in the same interview, Domingo reminded the public of the possible side effects of these vaccines being developed, saying such would depend on the type of the vaccine.
“Unang-una 'yung mga local side effects: pamamaga sa site ng injection, ‘yung pananakit ng katawan. Merong iba nagkakaroon sila ng mild symptoms: pamimigat ng katawan right after the vaccine,” he said.
Domingo assured the public that the FDA will look into these possibilities before certifying any vaccines against COVID-19. —AOL/KBK, GMA News

Interviewed on CNN Philippines, Mark Tolentino, president and CEO of MKG Universal Trading Corporation, said the price of the vaccine will be cheaper than others considering that Sinopharm is a state-owned company and the procurement will be between the Chinese and the Philippine governments.
“Hindi siya kasing mahal na pinagsasabi ng iba. Based on record, this is the most effective, pinaka-safe, and affordable na vaccine na available as of the present,” he said.
“In Malaysia, the price is $30 (more or less P1,500) per vial. This is the price in the Malaysian government. Iba naman ang Pilipinas kasi it will be subsidized by the Chinese government so possible it should be cheaper,” he added.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. has earlier said that buying Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine will be ""very problematic"" due to its hefty price at $76.

But according to Tolentino, the Sinopharm vaccine in China are actually for free. For private hospitals, the vaccine is sold at 800 Yuan or around P5,800.
“Hindi natin puwedeng i-compare 'yan sa G2G (government-to-government transaction) natin because approximately kapag G2G it should be cheaper because may diplomatic relationship involved,” he said.
“Possible 'yan, i-subsidize po ng Chinese government,” he added.
Tolentino also pointed out that Sinopharm has a higher efficacy rate on Asian recipients at 79%, compared to other vaccines such as those from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna.
Tolentino said that Sinopharm has not applied yet for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines because the government has not expressed its intention yet to negotiate with the Chinese government.
“Sinopharm is not yet applying for emergency use authorization because Sinopharm-China is waiting for the intent of the Philippines to whether or not Philippines would buy Sinopharm vaccines,” he said. —KBK, GMA News",GMA News

""Not to be overly optimistic, we wish that there will be transparency in the experimental results of these vaccines,"" he said.
""We know the urgency to have a vaccine as soon as possible but there are risks attached to fast-tracking the development of vaccines that normally takes 10 years to produce,"" he added.

The two companies said they had submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Monday seeking ""Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA)"" for their vaccine.
The move comes after large-scale tests showed their vaccine was 95 percent effective against Covid-19 and triggered no serious side effects.
If approved by the Amsterdam-based EMA, the vaccine could potentially be rolled out ""in Europe before the end of 2020"", the companies said in a statement.
Pfizer and BioNTech already filed for emergency use authorization with the US Food and Drug Administration on November 20.

A fellow frontrunner in the global vaccine race, US biotech company Moderna, said on Monday that it had sought emergency regulatory approval for its Covid-19 shot in both the United States and Europe.
The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are both based on a new technology that uses mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) to deliver genetic material to the body that makes human cells create a protein from the virus.
This trains the immune system to be ready to attack if it encounters the novel coronavirus.
But Moderna's vaccine can be kept in long term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus four degrees Fahrenheit) while Pfizer's requires minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
The two vaccines have been developed at breathtaking speed as part of an unprecedented effort to end a pandemic that has infected more than 62 million people worldwide and killed more than 1.4 million.

""This way, we can ensure that the patrons going to these businesses will not be at risk for infection to the coronavirus and become unknowing vectors.""
Biazon issued the statement amid the government's plan to reopen leisure establishments such as cinemas, museums, and video and interactive game arcades -- a plan opposed by several sectors, including local officials.
The lawmaker pointed out that the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IAFT) should synchronize the opening of sectors in the economy with that of the COVID-19 vaccine plan for that specific sector.

""We should identify sectors in the economy to open up, and the reopening should be tied in with a vaccination plan for that sector. This will help boost not just immunity, but more importantly, the confidence of consumers to actually patronize those businesses,” Biazon said.
He said if businesses were opened without a ""confidence-building measure"" such as a concrete vaccination plan, ""the consumer response may not be enough to sustain the overhead cost.""
Biazon added that this could also lead to a surge of COVID-19 infections.
Some mayors in Metro Manila have expressed apprehension on the reopening of leisure establishments, saying it is still risky for the public as the threat of COVID-19 is still there.

The Maryland-based company uses insect cells to grow synthesized pieces of the SARS-CoV-2's ""spike protein,"" which the virus uses to invade cells, in order to trigger the human body's immune response. 
It also uses an ""adjuvant,"" a compound that boosts the production of neutralizing antibodies.
In the spring, the company said it had proven the efficacy of a seasonal flu vaccine it had developed using similar technology.
The amount awarded to Novavax by the US is higher than the $1.2 billion given to the Oxford University vaccine that is being developed by AstraZeneca.
Under Operation Warp Speed, the US is aiming to deliver millions of doses of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 in 2021.
Also Tuesday, the US said it was providing New York-state based Regeneron with $450 million to scale up manufacture of its COVID0-19 antibody treatment.
The company, which announced on Monday it was entering late stage human trials, estimates that it could have between 70,000 and 300,000 treatment doses, with the first available by late summer.
The drug, called REGN-COV2, is a combination of two antibodies that block the coronavirus' spike protein.
Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of antibodies harvested from genetically-modified mice with human immune systems and from humans, identifying the two they found to be most potent, while not competing against each other.
The company uses a multi-antibody strategy to decrease the chances that the virus will mutate in order to evade the blocking action of a single antibody, an approach it detailed in a recent study in Science.

It is the first such deal for Australia, and Morrison said his government was also in talks with ""many parties around the world"" over other potential vaccines as well as supporting local scientists in their efforts.
The country is yet to reach a final agreement with AstraZeneca on the cost, and a local manufacturer has not been locked in.
However, Australia has signed an Aus$25 million ($18 million) agreement with American medical technology company Becton Dickinson to buy 100 million needles and syringes to administer the doses.
Although none of the coronavirus vaccines under development has proved its efficacy yet in clinical trials, at least 5.7 billion doses have been pre-ordered around the world.

Five vaccines -- three Western and two Chinese -- are in Phase 3 efficacy trials involving thousands of people, including the Oxford vaccine.

AstraZeneca has also signed agreements to provide doses to the US, Europe and Brazil.
Another deal struck by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, would see India manufacture the Oxford vaccine for distribution in 57 low- and middle-income countries.

First shipments of a COVID-19 vaccine created by Western laboratories have often been snapped up by the United States.

Morrison said Australia remained ""committed"" to ensuring early access to the potential vaccine for Pacific countries and regional partners in Southeast Asia.

Earlier this month he called on nations to share potential vaccines, saying any country that discovered one and did not make it available globally ""would be judged terribly by history"".

Australia has recorded almost 24,000 cases of COVID-19 and 438 fatalities to date.

Early in the pandemic it was considered among the most successful at curbing the virus's spread until an outbreak in Melbourne, the country's second-biggest city, that authorities struggled to contain.

The outbreak -- which was traced back to two hotels being used to quarantine travellers returning from overseas -- has ravaged aged-care homes in the city, causing dozens of deaths.

Governments around the world are desperate for a vaccine to help end the pandemic, which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and global economic turmoil. The World Health Organization (WHO) had flagged AstraZeneca's as the most promising.
The vaccine is in late-stage clinical trials in the United States, Britain, Brazil and South Africa and additional trials are planned in Japan and Russia.

AstraZeneca has already agreed to supply close to three billion doses to governments across the globe — more than any other vaccine project.
The WHO's chief scientist said the pause in the trials should serve as a ""wake-up"" call that there would be ups and downs in the development of a vaccine.
""Inevitably with such a large trial there will be times when safety issues arise,"" said Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.

“We need to ensure that all of these vaccines are safe and they are efficacious before we allow it to be sold or procured by the government,” Health Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire said in a report on State of the Nation with Jessica Soho.
Scientists and medical experts around the world have been working double time to develop a vaccine to end the pandemic, with a promising few entering clinical trials.

President Rodrigo Duterte earlier said he would give preference to the vaccines being developed by Russia and China because other countries are asking for advance payment.

“That’s the one thing that’s wrong with Western companies. Kaya sabi ko we will give preference to Russia and China provided that their vaccine is as good as any other in the market,” Duterte had said.

Russia had said it is open to the possibility of producing locally the anti-COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V for the Philippines.
The country is participating in the phase 3 clinical trials for Sputnik V.
Given the country's scarce funds, President Rodrigo Duterte also said the government will buy the cheapest COVID-19 vaccine that will be available in the market, saying all vaccines have the same effect.

The British drugmaker said it will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, around four times as many as US competitor Pfizer. Seven hundred million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.
""This means we have a vaccine for the world,"" said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford University vaccine group that developed the drug.
The vaccine on average prevented 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil but the success rate rose to 90% if the vaccine was administered as a half dose followed by a full dose. The efficacy was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most study participants.
No serious safety events were confirmed, the company said.

AstraZeneca's shares fell 4%, on track for their worst daily performance in six-months, as investors perceived the efficacy data as disappointing compared with rivals. Pfizer and Moderna , which reported that their vaccines prevented around 95% of cases, had set the bar for success sky-high.
The AstraZeneca shot does, however, have some advantages over offerings from U.S. rivals.
The drug's cost to governments works out at just a few dollars a shot, a fraction of the price of shots from Pfizer and Moderna, which use a more unconventional technology.
It can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute, especially in poor countries, than Pfizer's, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C.
The faster roll-out means both rich and poor countries that had been drawing up plans to ration vaccines can distribute them more widely, helping to eventually halt the social and economic disruption of a pandemic that has killed 1.4 million people.
""The bulk of the vaccine rollout programme will be in January, February, March. And we hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal,"" said Matt Hancock, health secretary of Britain which has pre-ordered 100 million doses for its 67 million people.
In poor countries, where the logistics of distributing rival vaccines posed a bigger challenge, the effect of a cheaper and easier alternative could be even more pronounced. Zahid Maleque, health minister of Bangladesh, which is buying in 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine made in India, called the findings ""really good news"".
""The big advantage of having the vaccine is that it can be stored, transported and handled at 2-8 degrees Celsius, and we have that storage facility,"" he said.
The World Health Organization's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan called the results ""encouraging"" and said the health body looked forward to seeing the data.
""We welcome the efforts of Oxford/AZ to make the vaccine affordable and easy to store, which will be good for countries and people everywhere.""
""WE'LL BE A LOT HAPPIER""
Nevertheless, there was criticism of AstraZeneca's findings.
Analysts from SVB Leerink, a healthcare-focused investment bank, said AstraZeneca had not yet disclosed enough information about safety events that had forced it to temporarily put a study on hold in the United States.
Leerink noted that only a small number of people had received the smaller first dose. Of 131 cases of COVID-19 in the study, researchers did not say how many had received the smaller initial dose to form the basis for their 90% efficacy finding.
Leerink said it was unlikely the vaccine would be approved for use in the United States, because the data so far did not match requirements set by regulators there. AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose.
Some scientists said all three vaccines could prove comparable in the end.
""I think it is a real fool's errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of phase 3 data from press releases,"" said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London.
""For the bigger picture, my suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we'll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we'll be a lot happier.""
Pascal Soriot, Astra's chief executive, said the smaller initial dose was good news, as it meant limited supplies could stretch further to vaccinate more people.
The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, a different approach from Pfizer and Moderna, which rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA).
AstraZeneca will now prepare regulatory submission of the data to authorities around the world that have a framework for conditional or early approval. It will also seek an emergency use listing from the WHO to speed up availability in poor countries. -- Reuters",GMA News

He added that he would ""willingly"" do it regardless of which country the vaccine would come from.
The first COVID-19 vaccine that may be available in the country in March 2021 would probably come from China, according to National Task Force Against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
The Palace also said President Rodrigo Duterte is willing to get vaccinated once the COVID-19 vaccines secure emergency use authorization from local regulators.

The proposals have generated fierce debate among scientists. Here is the rationale behind, and criticism of, these alternative strategies:
Why delay the second dose?
In clinical trials, companies tested specific doses of their vaccines at precise time intervals to generate evidence showing how well they work. All COVID-19 vaccines approved, so far, are designed to teach the immune system to recognize and defend against the virus with a first dose, and then provide a second booster dose to reinforce that lesson.
Faced with a fast-spreading pandemic and new, more transmissible coronavirus variants, some countries are hoping to widen immunization by giving some protection to as many people as possible with a first dose, and delaying second doses.

BioNTech warns against delaying second vaccine dose
Maximizing the number of people who have partial immunity ""should reduce the number of severe COVID-19 cases and thus alleviate the burden on hospitals,"" said Michael Head, a global health expert at Britain's University of Southampton.
What about switching between COVID vaccines?
Mixing or switching between COVID-19 vaccines is largely driven by the same aim—vaccinating as many people as possible as the pandemic still rages.
Giving a priming dose of one vaccine and a booster dose of another offers flexibility to offer whichever shots are available, rather than holding shots back so individuals always get both doses of the same vaccine.
Have these strategies been tested in rigorous trials?
No.
None of the late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trials compared these dose-sparing strategies or the effects of mixing vaccine types, said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
Officials have cited limited evidence from trials that the Pfizer/BioNTech , the Oxford University/AstraZeneca and the Moderna vaccines all confer some protection against COVID-19 after the first dose.
Britain's MHRA health regulator said on Dec. 30 it had found an 80% success rate for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine when two full doses are administered, three months apart, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found.
The UK government's vaccine advisory committee said on Dec. 31 that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine conferred 89% protection from two weeks after the first dose, and that for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine ""the evidence shows that the initial dose...offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus."" It did not give detailed data.
Moderna reported its vaccine was 80% protective after one dose, with efficacy peaking two weeks after the first shot.
But there is no long-term evidence that any of these vaccines will offer lasting immunity based on just one dose, or how effective they will be if the second dose is delayed.
BioNTech and Pfizer warned on Monday they had no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose was given more than 21 days after the first.
Evans said that ideally ""it is safest and most cautious"" to use vaccines in conditions exactly matching those of their trials, but added: ""In the real world, this is never so.""
Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Friday the United States was unlikely to delay giving second doses.
""We're going to keep doing what we're doing,"" he said.
Likewise, scientists have raised concerns over the idea of mixing two different types of vaccines. Some experts speculate that, because all of the vaccines target the same outer ""spike"" protein of the virus, they could work together to train the body to fight off the virus.
But there is no evidence this approach will work.
""There is literally zero data. It has not been tested, or if it has been tested, the data have not been made available,"" said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.
What about reducing the amount of vaccine in each dose?
In the United States, some health officials are considering offering half doses of Moderna's vaccine to individuals aged 18 to 55. There is some clinical trial data backing this strategy.
Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the US vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, told CBS on Sunday that evidence from a Moderna trial showed the half dose induced an ""identical immune response"" to the higher 100 microgram dose in adults aged 55 and under. He said the US government was discussing the issue with Moderna and regulators.
Slaoui said he believed injecting half of the volume of vaccine was ""a more responsible approach that would be based on facts and data.""
Several US scientists agreed, but noted the data was not publicly available. ""It's very fuzzy. I want to see that data,"" said Eric Topol, a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.
So are these strategies safe? And will they work?
It's not clear.
While there is no scientific evidence on the impact of delaying COVID-19 vaccine doses, some experts believe it could be safe to wait and the potential payoff in protecting a larger swath of the population may be worth it.
Others aren't so sure.
""There's just no data,"" said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at Britain's Reading University.
The British Society of Immunology said in a statement on Monday that delaying a second dose by eight weeks ""would be unlikely to have a negative effect on the overall immune response."" It added that it would not expect any extra safety risks from the delay beyond the potential increased risk of disease during the interim between doses.
Some scientists also said that while there was no evidence to support the strategy of mixing vaccine doses from different manufacturers—a method known as heterologous prime-boost—evidence from other vaccines provided some reassurance.
""Based on previous studies which combine different vaccine types, a combination of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines is likely to be safe,"" said Helen Fletcher, a professor of immunology at LSHTM.
Topol called the mix-and-match strategy ""a big mistake"" with ""unpredictable"" results—including the potential for adverse reactions or a significant drop-off in efficacy. ""It makes no sense whatsoever,"" he said.
Some worry about safety issues, particularly with delaying the second dose for several weeks. The gap could allow time for the virus to evolve and develop resistance to the vaccine.
Weak antibody protection could also increase the risk of having an abnormal immune response—such as antibody-dependent enhancement—when people encounter the real virus, Topol said.
How practical is it to prolong dosing time schedules?
Extending the interval poses adherence risks, raising the chance people may forget or fail to return for a second dose.
It also increases the length of time during which they are less than optimally protected, and it could make it harder for health authorities to keep track of who has had which vaccine, when, and how often.
Given these risks, immunology and public health experts say clear communication is imperative to ensure people understand that although dosing schedules may be subject to change, two COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed to give the best protection. — Reuters",GMA News

LAGRIMAS,2021-01-19 11:58:00,"There is ""compelling legal basis"" for government transparency on vaccine procurement even though the country is under a state of public health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines said Tuesday.
IBP president Domingo Egon Cayosa joined calls for the government to inform Filipinos about the vaccines they intend to purchase, citing provisions of the Constitution and an executive order by President Rodrigo Duterte.
""Transparency is helpful in establishing facts, dispelling doubts and suspicions, countering propaganda, minimizing political posturing, curbing corruption, promoting accountability, nurturing cooperation, and in enhancing trust in our country’s governance,"" Cayosa said in a statement.
He said the policy of public disclosure on transactions involving public interest, coupled with an acknowledgment of the people's right to information, is found in Article II, Section 28, and Article III, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution.
Cayosa said that the Supreme Court interpreted these provisions as seeking to ""promote transparency in policy-making and in the operations of the government, as well as provide the people sufficient information to exercise effectively other constitutional rights.""

In addition, he said that Duterte signed an executive order on the freedom of information in 2016 which recognizes ""a legal presumption in favor of access to information, public records, and official records.""
""There is compelling legal basis for  transparency, even under the COVID-19 emergency,"" Cayosa said.
""It is good to let the people know more about the COVID-19 vaccines, the decisions to be made for them, and the public funds therefor.  A well-informed citizenry will 'heal as one,' better and faster,"" he added.
Government officials in charge of securing COVID-19 vaccines for the Philippines face mounting demands for transparency amid questions on the price and efficacy of the shots they seek to procure.
Much of the doubt has centered on what critics say is the government's seeming preference for Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac, whose vaccine was reportedly one of the most expensive among other candidate brands.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque claimed that each dose of Sinovac's product would cost just around P650, much lower than the initially reported figure of over P3,600 for two doses.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. said the government is negotiating for the ""best price.""

However, the researchers cautioned the project was still at an early stage.
""There is still much work to be done before we can confirm if our vaccine will help manage the COVID-19 pandemic,"" vaccine developer Sarah Gilbert said.
""We still do not know how strong an immune response we need to provoke to effectively protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" she said, adding researchers needed to learn more about COVID-19 and continue late stage trials which have already commenced.
AstraZeneca shares surged 10%, but then gave up most of those gains, to trade 1.2% stronger on the day.
AstraZeneca has signed agreements with governments around the world to supply the vaccine should it prove effective and gain regulatory approval. The company has said it will not seek to profit from the vaccine during the pandemic.
Adrian Hill, the director of Oxford university's Jenner Institute, said early projections that a million doses of the vaccine could be made by September could be an under-estimate, depending on how quickly late-stage trials can be completed.
He added it remained possible that the vaccine could be in use by the end of the year.
Researchers said the vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently than a control group, but some of these could be reduced by taking paracetamol.
AZD1222 was developed by Oxford university and licensed to AstraZeneca, which has put it into large-scale, late-stage trials to test its efficacy. It has also already signed deals to produce and supply over 2 billion doses of the shot.

The local manufacturing output rebounded to a 25-month high in January as the Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) rose to 52.5 in January to post above the 50.0 threshold that separates expansion from contraction, results of the monthly survey conducted by IHS Markit.
""Peso exchange rate stronger vs. the US dollar today... after the stronger Markit manufacturing date in more than 2 years or since December 2018 or more than a year before COVID, sustaining the recovery even after the Christmas season,"" Michael Ricafort, senior economist at the Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC), said in a mobile message.
Ricafort also noted optimism on the news regarding the COVID-19 vaccines, as Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. over the weekend said the Philippines is scheduled to receive some 5.6 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines in the first quarter of the year.

Domingo made the remark in responding to concerns raised by the Bangsamoro Region leaders that the COVID-19 vaccine should have halal certification.
The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos defines ""halal"" in Arabic to mean ""permissible"" and refers to food and non-food products that are lawful for consumption.
Also, based on Shari’ah law, the concept covers other transactions including banking, finance and other activities Islam believers are engaged in.
“We have asked for that information sa ating mga applicant,” Domingo said during the Laging Handa briefing.

“Iyong Pfizer-BioNTech, they are working on Halal certification. Iyong AstraZeneca, meron silang certification na walang animal product o animal source ang kanilang bakuna, but they are still working on their Halal certification,” Domingo added.
So far, the FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech, and AstraZeneca-Oxford University.
Pfizer-BioNTech showed an efficacy rate of 95% and 92% in its study population and among all races, respectively based on FDA's evaluation.
AstraZeneca, for its part, was found to have a 70% efficacy rate after the first dose—a rating that goes higher depending on the interval of giving the second dose—after FDA scrutiny.
Other COVID-19 vaccine makers with pending EUA application before FDA include Sinovac, Gamaleya, and Bharat BioTech.
Domingo said that only Sinovac has secured Halal certification so far but the FDA is not yet done reviewing the results of its human trials, which the Chinese company only submitted last January 19.
Sinovac's efficacy rate after human trials abroad, however, vary from 50% to 91%.
As of Wednesday, the Philippines recorded 518,407 COVID-19 cases. Of this number, 475,542 recovered and 10,481 died. The number of active COVID-19 cases is at 32,384. —LBG, GMA News",GMA News

The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is running the trials, said in a statement that 4,600 of the planned 5,000 volunteers have been vaccinated in Brazil without any of them reporting any serious health issues.
The volunteers have been recruited in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador in the northeastern state of Bahia where a hospital is conducting the tests.
AstraZeneca paused global trials temporarily last week after an unexplained illness in a participant in Britain.
Brazil has the third worst coronavirus outbreak after the United States and India and has become a sought-out testing ground for COVID-19 vaccines under development in Britain, China and Russia.

DOH spokesperson Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the remark amid persistent questions on the government’s purchase 25 million doses from Chinese firm Sinovac even if its efficacy rate was lower compared to Western counterparts.
“On the question on if we can choose which vaccine to have… it is not an option right now kasi alam naman po natin na limitado po ang ating supplies. Iyong galing sa COVAX, hindi po ito karamihan,” Vergeire said in an interview on ANC.
COVAX is the global collaboration of manufacturers and experts to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.

Aside from limited COVID-19 vaccine supply, Vergeire said that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines can only be administered in limited areas such as Metro Manila, cities of Cebu and Davao, as well as some parts of Regions 3 (Central Luzon) and 4A (Calabarzon) since these are the only areas equipped with ultra low freezer facilities needed to store Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines require -70 to -80 degrees celsius storage.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said that COVID-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, China’s Sinovac and AstraZeneca are expected to arrive in the country during the first quarter of the year for the vaccination of the health care workers.
Pfizer-BioNTech and AztraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccines have been proven at least 95% and 90% effective after human trials, respectively.
Sinovac, on the other hand, yielded varying efficacy rates after human trials, depending on the location of such clinical trials.
Its efficacy rate reached 50% in Brazil, 65% in Indonesia and 91% in Turkey.
The Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) already granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, saying that such vaccine showed 95% efficacy rate in the study population and 92% efficacy rate among all racial groups.

The trials evaluated the efficacy of the two-shot vaccine candidate 14 days after inoculation of participants, including healthcare workers who treat COVID-19 patients.
In Turkey, the vaccine was tested in two stages among health care workers and the general population, and found to have a 91.25% efficacy rate in preventing COVID-19 based on an analysis of 29 cases, the company said.
In early January this year, Brazilian researchers reported interim results from the CoronaVac vaccine trial showing it was 50.4% effective at preventing symptomatic infections.

A coronavirus variant circulating in Brazil is likely able to reinfect people who survived infections with earlier versions of the coronavirus, new data suggest.
The variant that emerged in Brazil, called P.1, carries a mutation that is already known to make a variant prevalent in South Africa harder to treat with antibodies and harder to prevent with available vaccines.
New data suggest that in many recovered patients, immunity to earlier versions of the virus will not afford immunity to P.1.

""Lower neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and partial immunity against new variants suggests that reinfection could occur in convalescent or even vaccinated individuals,"" the authors said.
In a separate paper posted on Wednesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, some of the same researchers estimated that among every 100 survivors of COVID-19 due to earlier virus versions, 25-to-60 could become reinfected if exposed to the P.1 variant because their antibodies could not protect them.
As of Thursday, according to the US Centers for Disease Control of Prevention, there have been 13 cases of COVID-19 due to P.1 in the United States.
COVID-19 vaccine antibodies pass into breast milk
COVID-19 antibodies induced by vaccines from Pfizer Inc/BioNTech and Moderna Inc can pass into breast milk, a small study suggests, although it is not clear yet how long the antibodies will be present.
Six breastfeeding mothers who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines provided researchers with milk samples before and after vaccination, with the last sample collected two weeks after the second shot.
None of the women had been infected with the coronavirus.
A week after the first shot, all of the women had COVID-19 antibodies in their breast milk.
Antibody levels fell slightly afterward and then sharply increased after the second shot.
The two vaccines were similarly effective in inducing the antibodies, although antibody levels varied from woman to woman, the research team reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
""Further research is needed on the longevity of the antibody response in breast milk, as well as the magnitude and duration of effect on infant immunity to the virus,"" the researchers said. -- Reuters",GMA News

Some of the industries hit hardest by travel curbs, social distancing and lockdowns rebounded on hopes that the world may return to normal, after pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their vaccine candidate was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19.
A vaccine is seen as the best hope to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since Covid-19 first emerged in China late last year and unleashed devastation on the global economy.
""Bombed-out sectors such as aviation, travel, leisure, big oil... time-warped back to 2019 with giant rallies,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst from OANDA.
Wall Street and European markets soared after the announcement, and Asian markets continued the rally on Tuesday, with worst-hit sectors such as airlines, travel, entertainment and energy getting a boost.

""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,"" Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said.
Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate is one of more than 40, but no other has yet made similar claims about effectiveness.
The companies said they could pass the final hurdles for a US rollout later this month, and could supply up to 50 million doses globally this year and up to 1.3 billion next year.
The scientific community reacted positively, with top US expert Anthony Fauci describing the results as ""extraordinary"" and World Health Organization boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailing the news as ""encouraging"".
But others pointed out that data from the ongoing trial was still needed for review, including the ages of the participants.
The Pfizer candidate uses the ""messenger RNA"" method to fight the virus, but a major disadvantage of such vaccines is that they need to be stored in specialist deep freezers as opposed to refrigerator-level temperatures required for some other types of prophylactics.
Experts have raised concerns about the capacity of poorer nations, especially in warm climates, to set up safe supply chains for such a vaccine.
There was some bad news too. Brazil's health regulator announced Monday it had suspended clinical trials of a Chinese-developed vaccine -- one of the most advanced candidates -- after an ""adverse incident"" involving a volunteer recipient.
Its maker Sinovac said it was confident in the safety of the vaccine.
'A very dark winter'
The coronavirus has infected close to 51 million people worldwide, with more than 1.2 million deaths.
The United States remains the hardest-hit nation at more than 10 million cases and nearly 240,000 deaths, and the pandemic was one of the top issues for voters in the presidential election this month.
Joe Biden, who had slammed President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis, spared no time in announcing a Covid-19 taskforce after he was declared the winner of the election.
""We're still facing a very dark winter,"" he said. ""The bottom line: I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around once we're sworn in.""
Trump had clashed repeatedly with his own government experts, often refusing to back restrictions or even wear a mask in public. After the Pfizer announcement, he claimed -- without evidence -- that the news was delayed until after the election to damage him.
There was a separate breakthrough when the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted emergency approval to a synthetic antibody treatment for Covid-19 developed by the pharma company Eli Lilly.
Bamlanivimab, which was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and emergency room visits, is the first major drug to be approved that was designed specifically for the coronavirus.
'Out of control'
The vaccine news will be of particular relief to people in Europe -- the current focal point of the pandemic and the region subject to the most widespread restrictions.
Italy was edging closer to a full lockdown, with experts warning of pressure on hospitals.
""There is no doubt that the situation is largely out of control,"" said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases department at Milan's Sacco hospital.
Grim news kept coming elsewhere, with Russia surpassing its record for daily infections again Monday.

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/healthandwellness/750175/why-polio-vaccine-is-important-for-children-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story/,Why polio vaccine is important for children amid COVID-19 pandemic,JANNIELYN ANN BIGTAS,2020-08-06 20:06:00,"Polio vaccine is important for children even as the world addresses an already big health issue which is the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
In an interview with GMA News Online, UNICEF Philippines immunization specialist Dr. Carla Ante-Orozco said the polio virus was “an important issue that must be addressed even amid the COVID-19 pandemic.”
She said even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s already a polio outbreak in the country.
After polio reemerged in the Philippines in 2019 with 16 confirmed cases, Ante-Orozco said health experts had been fearing an increase as the response to its outbreak had to be suspended due to COVID-19.
Ante-Orozco said the global pandemic was “overstretching health systems” and the longer it continued “the more that essential health services, including vaccination services are disrupted.”

Facebook post goes viral for saying SexBomb Girls predicted COVID-19 pandemic
According to Ante-Orozco, many children are not vaccinated amid the lockdown, adding up to the number who have missed their routine immunization in the past years.
Given this situation, “there has been an accumulation of susceptible children that are at high risk for polio and other vaccine preventable diseases.”
Ante-Orozco stressed that “protecting our children from diseases is everyone’s responsibility, parents, government officials, civil society, corporations, media—all of us have a role in immunization.”
“Immunization is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to protect children’s lives and futures,” she said.
Ante-Orozco said that through vaccines, many were able to survive without seeing their family or friends die or suffer life-long disability from smallpox or polio.
What do parents need to know about poliovirus?
According to Ante-Orozco, polio is an infectious disease initiated by the poliovirus, which causes lifetime paralysis and death.
It is transmitted mainly through fecal routes or much less frequently by contaminated water or food.
“For example, if someone touches human waste contaminated with the virus, and then eats food without washing their hands properly, the virus could enter the body through the mouth,” said Ante-Orozco.
Polio affects mainly children under the age of 5 years old, although Ante-Orozco said it also occasionally infected adults.
She said there’s no known cure for polio and the only way to protect your children from it was through vaccination.
Ante-Orozco said if a population was not sufficiently immunized, the weakened poliovirus would continue to circulate, which is one of the factors that caused its reemergence.
Additionally, she noted that the longer poliovirus was allowed to survive, “the more changes it undergoes.”
“The polio outbreak in the Philippines is confirmed to be from a circulating poliovirus type 1 and type 2,” she said.
She said this was alarming since wild poliovirus type 2 was certified as globally eradicated in 2015.
Ante-Orozco warned that “poorly conducted immunization activities, when too few children have received the required 3 doses of polio vaccine, leave them susceptible to poliovirus, either from vaccine-derived or wild polioviruses.”
She said only “full immunization protects them from both forms of the virus.”
What do parents need to know about the polio vaccine? Is it safe?
According to Ante-Orozco, the oral polio vaccine or OPV is safe and effective even for newborn babies.
“It is the only proven protection against polio,” she said.
Citing the World Health Organization (WHO), Ante-Orozco said more than 18 million people had been protected from polio-caused paralysis in over 50 years of administering the oral polio vaccine.
She said the vaccine was safe and it was “essential to administer multiple doses of oral polio vaccine to children.”
The immunization specialist noted how the vaccine was designed to be administered multiple times to ensure full protection of a child.
“Each additional dose further strengthens a child’s immunity level against polio,” Ante-Orozco added.
Where can parents get their children vaccinated?
Ante-Orozco said caregivers and parents could take their children to be vaccinated in health centers or wait for UNICEF’s Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio vaccination teams to go to their homes.
For parents worried due to COVID-19, Ante-Orozco assured that their health workers were trained on infection prevention and control during polio vaccination campaigns.
She said the workers were equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
According to UNICEF, the total coverage for all 6 regions in Mindanao for the Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio mass immunization campaign is about 95.7% or 3.3 million children vaccinated.
Meanwhile, in Central Luzon, UNICEF said the total coverage of children vaccinated was 70.34% or 322,393 children.
They have also conducted campaigns in Basilan (67.5%) and Sulu (70.5%), which are their lowest coverages.
According to UNICEF, vaccination campaigns are still ongoing in Region 3 and 4A.
UNICEF noted that childhood immunization coverage had declined in recent years from 87% in 2014 to 68% in 2019.
What else can parents do to protect their children from poliovirus?
While vaccines are the only prevention and protection against poliovirus, Ante-Orozco said they always “remind families to wash their hands regularly with soap and water, use a toilet, consume food that is fully cooked, and drink safe water.”
“If the safety of your water is in doubt, boil it, ensuring it is bubbling vigorously for at least one minute before allowing it to cool,” she addes.
Additionally, Ante-Orozco said “cleaning one’s surroundings and practicing good personal hygiene are added measures that can prevent infection.”
The immunization specialist stressed that “all children, no matter where they live or their circumstances, have the right to survive and to access the best available healthcare—and we each have the responsibility to help them realize these rights.” – RC, GMA News",GMA News

Interviewed on Dobol B sa News TV, FDA director general Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo noted the review on the vaccine will take two to four weeks to come up with a decision.
“Ang FDA, sinusuri niya lahat ng data. Kailangna maipakita po sa amin 'yung data, findings, tsaka 'yung scientific na mga information about the vaccine to assure na safe siya at tsaka effective siya,” he said.
“Hindi naman po ibig sabihin porke na-approve na, e approve na po sa lahat. Porke approve na siya sa Russia, e automatic approval dito,” he added.
On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia became the first country in the world to approve a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, calling it Sputnik V, after the world's first satellite successfully launched into space by Russia in 1957.

Palace: FDA to ensure COVID-19 vaccine is safe before Duterte gets it 
Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte said he had accepted Putin's offer to provide the country with a vaccine against COVID-19 and that he is willing to try it for himself  during clinical trials.
Citing information from a meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO), Domingo said that there were doubts on how Russia jumped to the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Ang huling update natin ay sa Russia mukhang nasa Phase 2 clinical trial pa lamang at patapos pa lamang. Kaya siguro nagulat din ang buong mundo na biglang kine-claim nila na approved na,” he said.
""Hindi natin alam kung ano 'yung approval process na nangyari sa Russia or baka talagang nag-approve na sila after Phase 2 o kung talagang na-complete nila 'yung Phase 3,’ he added.
Domingo said the FDA will get more information about the approval of the Sputnik V vaccine.
However, ""Defeat COVID-19 Ad Hoc Committee"" chairperson and former Health secretary Iloilo 1st District Rep. Janette Loreto-Garin said that Russia only released limited information about the vaccine.
“Mahirap po kasi dahil walang transparency sa kanilang scientific data 'yung Sputnik V,” she said in a separate interview on Dobol B sa News TV.
“Kung titingnan mo very limited kasi 'yung kanilang information na nire-release,” she added.
Garin, who is also a vaccinologist, said Russia claimed to start the Phase 3A of the clinical trial on Wednesday, August 12, and to mass manufacture in September. For Garin, this is impossible.
She noted that Phase 3A clinical trial usually encompasses 10,000 to 30,000 subjects. According to her, 80 to 90 percent of trials usually fail at this stage.
Garin said the mass manufacture of vaccines can start  six to eight months after the completion of Phase 3 clinical trial. In emergency cases like the pandemic, three to four months of process is possible.
Based on the plan of Russia, the entire process is reduced to a month, which, Garin said, never happened before.
“I would not agree to the Philippines being part of the Phase 3 simply because we don’t have a copy of their protocol,” she said.
“The world, and the vaccinologists, and WHO are not aware how Russia was able to finish Phase 2,” she added.
For Garin, these details are red flags on the safety of the vaccine. —LBG, GMA News",GMA News

Likewise, the measure provides for a P500 million indemnity fund for the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) which would enable the state-run health insurance firm to grant financial compensation in case of death, permanent disability, or hospital confinement of an individual who was inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine.
The same measure also mandates the Department of Health to issue a COVID-19 vaccine card, subject to the provisions of the Data Privacy Act.

On Monday, Moderna said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers, according to very early data, putting it at the front in the race.
Inovio said preliminary results from its human trial are expected in June. The 40 healthy participants in the Phase 1 trial are given two shots, four weeks apart, of the vaccine, called INO-4800, and then followed for two weeks.
""We are already seeing safety data and it has been benign,"" Dr. Katherine Broderick, head of research and development at Inovio, told Reuters. ""Some people have slight redness of the arm.""
Both Moderna and Inovio are using newer technology that focuses on specific genes on the outer ""spike"" portion of the virus.
Inovio's vaccine was designed using its DNA medicine platform, while Moderna's vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. Both companies have no approved drug in the market.
Inovio has been severely criticized by Citron Research, with the short seller slapping a target price of $2 on the company's stock.
Once the preliminary data is in, Inovio expects to approach the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization to move into a Phase 2/3 trial, which could happen in July or August.
Inovio said the latest animal study results, published in the journal Nature Communications, validate its DNA medicines platform.
It plans to test the vaccine in larger animals including rabbits and monkeys, and undertake ""challenge"" studies in mice, ferrets and monkeys, Broderick said.
""Challenge"" studies involve intentionally giving the virus to an animal and then seeing if the vaccine prevents infection.

Setad, a giant state-affiliated conglomerate controlled by Iran's supreme leader, said production of the vaccine developed by one of its companies, Shifa Pharmed, could reach 12 million doses per month, six months after a successful trial ends.
The first volunteers to take the vaccine were officials of the conglomerate and the daughter of its head, in an apparent effort to boost public confidence in the vaccine.
""The message of this act was that we do not see ourselves apart from the people, and we brought our family first to test this vaccine,"" Health Minister Saeed Namaki said, according to state broadcaster IRIB.
Iran has been the worst-hit country in the Middle East by the global COVID-19 pandemic. It complains that its ability to buy vaccines is hampered by US financial sanctions, reimposed after the Trump administration abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement.

During the hearing, House appropriations panel vice chair Ruffy Biazon asked if the Philippines' participation in clinical trials will allow it to get priority in the distribution of these COVID-19 vaccines once they are proven effective.
Montoya, in response, assured that an effective COVID-19 vaccine will be available to Filipinos, but there is no assurance on when this will be available.
""Basta ang isang vaccine developer ay naggawa ng clinical trial sa isang bansa, they will make that vaccine available. Ang tanong lang is kaagad ba? Alam natin na itong panahon ng COVID-19, lahat ng bansa ay nag-uunahan na makakuha ng bakuna,"" he said.

""Ang kasiguraduhan lang po niyan, sigurado magkakaroon tayo. Depende na sa negosasyon na maaaring gagawin ng ating pamahalaan sa mga vaccine ng developer ng mga bakuna na magiging successful kung paano tayo mauuna sa pila,"" he added.
Back in May, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) approved the DOST's recommendation that the Philippines participate in the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.
The collaborating organizations for the clinical trials include the Adimmune Corporation, Acedemia Sinica, the Chinese Academy of Science - Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, and SinoPharma - Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Beijing Institute.
The Philippines also joined the upcoming Phase 3 clinical trials for Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V running from October 2020 to March 2021, with Russia expected to shoulder the costs.
But even if the country is a participant of these clinical trials, DOST Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña said it does not mean that the Philippines is committing to purchase vaccines from these developers.
""Kung ang bakuna na ito ay okay, 'yung isang bakuna ay okay din, hindi naman tayo puwedeng patali habang nagki-clinical trials,"" he said.
""Kung bibili tayo sa kanila, obligado sila dahil dito nila ginawa 'yung trials. Pero hindi tayo magco-commit na bibili tayo sa kanila kahit dito ginawa trial. Dahil tayo ay magko-compare pa rin. Dadaan 'yan sa procurement process,"" he added.
Dela Peña said the IATF has already approved the DOST's recommendation to create a sub-technical working group (TWG) for vaccine procurement.
""Doon sa vaccine procurement, DBM (Department of Budget and Management) na ang magche-chair ng sub-TWG at pitong ahensya ang kasali. Pero magsasabi pa rin kung ilan at alin ang bibilhin ay DOH (Department of Health),"" he added. —KG, GMA News",GMA News

PANTI,2021-01-20 14:06:00,"The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) can store more than one million doses of COVID-19 vaccines requiring ultra low storage, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday. 
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the announcement a day after Deputy Chief Implementer Vince Dizon of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 said the government is already negotiating with 28 private companies to ensure proper storage of COVID-19 vaccines to preserve their efficacy.
“RITM has five ultra low freezers for COVID-19 vaccines which can accommodate -20 to -80 degrees Celsius storage requirement,” the DOH official said in an online briefing. 
“Each ultra low freezer can store up to 230,200 doses or 46,240 vials,” she added.
In addition, Vergeire earlier said the DOH's 17 regional offices have equipment that can store vaccines requiring the 2 to 8 degrees Celsius storage temperature.

“We have this existing capacity of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius storage which [preservation] can last up to three months,” she said. 
Likewise, Vergeire said DOH has enough portable transport boxes for vaccine deployment because existing national immunization programs are being done house-to-house, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The DOH official, however, said the Health department does not have refrigerated trucks for vaccine deployment and such service is being contracted whenever the need arises, as in previous national immunization efforts. 
Vergeire earlier said the deployment of vaccines requiring ultra low cold storage of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will be limited to highly-urbanized areas such as Metro Manila, the cities of Cebu and Davao, and some parts of Central Luzon and Calabarzon since these are the only areas equipped with ultra low storage facilities. 
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. for his part, assured the public that the country will be securing 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from seven vaccine makers so far, namely, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Novovax, Johnson and Johnson, Gamaleya and Bharat BioTech. 
Only Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration so far. The FDA found it 95% and 92% effective on study population and among all races, respectively—a requirement before a vaccine can be administered in the country.
Galvez said that 70 million Filipinos will get a COVID-19 vaccine within the year in a best case scenario, and that the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination will start by February. —KG, GMA News",GMA News

Tuberculosis vaccine may limit COVID-19 deaths
A tuberculosis vaccine routinely given to children in countries with high rates of that bacterial disease might be helping to reduce deaths from COVID-19, researchers reported on Thursday in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
After accounting for differences in factors that might affect vulnerability to the virus - such as income, education, health services and age distribution - the researchers found that countries with higher rates of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinations for tuberculosis had lower peak mortality rates from COVID-19.
A good example was Germany, which had different vaccine plans before East Germany and West Germany were unified in 1990, the researchers said. COVID-19 mortality rates among senior citizens are nearly three times higher in western Germany than in eastern Germany, where more older people received the vaccine as infants, they found.

Weekly dorm screenings would not contain COVID-19 outbreaks
Avoiding coronavirus outbreaks in college dormitories would require screening tests for residents at least every three days, according to Yale University researchers. Weekly screening would not be sufficient, they concluded.
Their calculations, based on a computer model of 5,000 students and an 80-day semester, accounted for students' on-campus exposures to the virus as well as imported infections from students traveling, wandering about town to restaurants and bars, or from visitors.
Frequent testing would interrupt transmission of the virus only if infected students are isolated, the researchers said.
""Students must comply with infection control, social distancing, test scheduling and (if testing positive) isolation requirements for the repeat testing system to work effectively,"" the researchers said in a paper posted online on Thursday ahead of peer review.
Also, the tests must be reliable, testing laboratories must guarantee timely results, and efficient communications and supports must be in place so students who test positive can be isolated quickly, they said.
The researchers said universities must be prepared to close their residence halls if repeated testing fails to contain the spread of the pathogen on campus.
Molecular study finds multiple types of COVID-19
There are many ""flavors"" of COVID-19, according to new data that may someday allow coronavirus treatments to be targeted at the specific molecular changes making a person sick.
To learn more about why only some coronavirus patients become severely ill, researchers studied patients' ""blood transcriptome,"" the complete set of genes that are activated in immune cells in the blood.
They found at least five different types of immune response against the coronavirus - not just ""mild"" and ""severe,"" according to a paper posted online ahead of peer review. ""In other words, there are different flavors of the disease,"" just as there are different types of cancer, study co-author Dr. Joachim Schultze of the University of Bonn told Reuters.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms at work in a given patient could help doctors tailor the therapy to target those mechanisms, Schultze said.
The findings also helped his team predict which drugs would likely benefit COVID-19 patients.
One ""prominent"" candidate cited was the steroid dexamethasone, which has already been proven effective in some COVID-19 patients. Another ""surprising"" discovery they cited involved granulocytes, a type of white blood cell.
""Granulocytes, cells that are not really known to be major players in the fight against viruses, play a major role in severe COVID-19 disease,"" Schultze said. The new findings ""will help us to find better therapies and also will guide vaccine development,"" he added.
Months later, recovering patients still have symptoms
More evidence is emerging that severe COVID-19 has lingering after-effects. Nearly 90% of recovering COVID-19 patients discharged from a hospital in Rome were still not back to normal an average of two months after becoming ill, researchers said.
Doctors there studied 143 adults who had been hospitalized on average for two weeks. Most had been diagnosed with pneumonia, and one in five had needed help to breathe.
An average of 60 days after their first coronavirus symptoms, 87.4% still reported at least one symptom - particularly fatigue and shortness of breath - and 55% had three or more, researchers reported on Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
About one in four still had joint pain, and about one in five had chest pain. Roughly 44% said their quality of life was worse now than before they got sick. The researchers did not have information on patients' pre-COVID-19 medical problems and did not compare this relatively small group to patients discharged for other reasons.
But they said their findings suggest more research is needed on the long-lasting effects of coronavirus infection. -- Reuters",GMA News

PANTI,2021-02-19 09:50:00,"Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said Friday that COVID-19 vaccine makers are pushing for indemnity agreement due to the Dengvaxia experience, citing vaccine czar Carlito Galvez’s earlier claims.
Roque made the remark when reporters pressed him on the arrival date of COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines after the delay.
“Alam niyo po talagang ang sinabi sa atin ng COVAX facility eh darating yung kanilang Pfizer  eh dapat sa gitna ng Pebrero. Pero naantala nga po bakit? Tapatan na po, ang Pfizer ang siya ring gumawa ng Dengvaxia na bakuna na naging dahilan kung bakit nakasuhan hindi lang ang mga opisyales ng gobyerno kundi opisyales ng Pfizer,” Roque said in a PTV 4 interview, referring to the 117,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech under COVAX facility that he said should have arrived middle of February.
Roque mistakenly referred to Dengvaxia maker Sanofi Pasteur and not Pfizer, which he later corrected.
“Kaya humihingi sila ng indemnity agreement dahil ang kanilang bakuna ay covered ng EUA (emergency use authorization), at hindi pa ng general use authorization. Gumalaw naman po ang ating pamahalaan, ang Kongreso ay bumubuo ng isang batas na nagsasabi na gobyerno na ang magbabayad ng danyos para sa lahat ng magkakaroon ng side effects. Na-certify naman ito kahapon as urgent ng ating Presidente, kaya inaasahan n ating magiging batas ito,”  he said.

The Dengvaxia controversy started in November 2017 when Sanofi-Pasteur announced that their vaccine posed a risk to those who were not infected by dengue prior to being injected with the vaccine.
However, the announcement only came after the vaccine had been administered to over 700,000 children and even policemen.
At least 100 vaccinated individuals have died of unconfirmed causes after receiving Dengvaxia doses, and health officials have ruled that that fatalities cannot be directly linked to the vaccine.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Sanofi returned P1.16 billion to the Department of Health for the unused doses of vaccine.
In correcting himself, Roque still insisted that Pfizer is seeking indemnity for its COVID-19 vaccines because of Sanofi-Pasteur’s Dengvaxia experience.
“Lilinawin ko, mukhang mali ang sinabi ko kanina. Ang manufacturer ng dengvaxia ay Sanofi hindi Pfizer. Pero alam nyo po puro Europeans yan naguusap-usap po yan. Kaya nga po parang naging mas maingat ang Pfizer bilang isang kapwa European manufacturer ng Sanofi pagdating sa pagsusuplay ng EUA,” Roque added.
However, Pfizer is an American company, and not European.
Later, Roque said that COVID-19 vaccines, which are approved for emergency use, are not similar to Dengvaxia that had been approved for general use.
“Uulitin ko po ang sinabi ng mga dalubhasa. Sinabi ni dating [Health] Secratary [Esperanza] Cabral, ang Dengvaxia po eh dumaan sa proseso, hindi lang sa Pilipinas kung hindi sa buong mundo at sa WHO (World Health Organization). Ito ay binigyan ng GUA (general use authorization) hindi lang po EUA, at ito po ay desisyon ng WHO at ng lahat ng dalubhasa sa daigdig na ligtas ang Dengvaxia para gamitin sa dengue,” Roque said.
“Pero ang nangyari dito sa Pilipinas, hindi pa naman napapatunayan na ang mga namatay dahil sa Dengvaxia. Nagkaroon lang ng pagkatakot, kaya nga po ngayon umaapela kami: unang una Pilipinas pakinggan po natin ang mga dalubhasa, epidemiologist, specialista, mga vaccinologist at lahat naman sila nagsasabi na bagamat EUA, eh mas marami ‘yung benepisyo na makukuha natin sa mga bakuna laban sa COVID-19 kaysa dun sa kanilang posibleng mga side effects,” Roque added. —GMA News",GMA News

The deals follow a previously announced agreement with AstraZeneca for the firm to produce 100 million doses of its potential vaccine being developed in partnership with the University of Oxford.
Britain said it was the first such deal which Pfizer and BioNTech had agreed for the supply of their vaccine, which is being tested in early to mid stage trials.
The firms are aiming to make up to 100 million doses by the end of this year and potentially more than 1.2 billion doses by end of 2021, if the vaccine is successful.
It uses the so-called messenger RNA approach, in contrast to the more traditional, inactivated whole virus vaccine being developed by Valneva.
Valneva's potential vaccine is still in pre-clinical trials, and the company is aiming to move into clinical trials by the end of 2020.

Early tests of COVID-19 vaccines yield promising results
Results from trials of two potential COVID-19 vaccines yielded initial signs of efficacy with no serious adverse side effects, according to early data released on Monday.
One was a UK study of the candidate being developed by Oxford University and British drugmaker AstraZeneca.
The other was a Chinese study of a vaccine from CanSino Biologics. Both vaccines use a modified, harmless common cold virus known as an adenovirus to deliver genetic instructions to cells for inducing an immune response against the novel coronavirus.

The genetic components include a copy of a ""spike"" protein found on the surface of the novel coronavirus so that the immune system will recognize and attack the actual virus.
In both trials, according to reports in The Lancet, ""showing"" just the coronavirus spike protein to the body was enough to trigger the immune system to produce antibodies and germ-fighting T cells to battle the coronavirus.
The trials used healthy volunteers who were not directly exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19.
The studies just assessed immune responses to the vaccines, along with safety. Much larger trials will be needed to prove these vaccines to be safe and effective in preventing infection by the virus.
Inhaled interferon may help hospitalized COVID-19 patients
Treatment with an inhaled form of interferon significantly reduced the risk of worsening illness in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and improved their odds of recovery, according to preliminary data from a mid-stage trial released by Synairgen Plc on Monday.
In the trial not yet available for peer review, 101 patients received the experimental treatment, called SG001, or a placebo.
Patients who got SNG001 had a 79% lower risk of developing severe disease requiring ventilation or death.
They were also more than twice as likely to have recovered within 28 days of starting treatment.
Breathing difficulty was also markedly reduced in patients who received SNG001, the company said.
Interferon is a naturally occurring protein that regulates the body's antiviral responses.
""There are reasons to believe it could well be an effective treatment, but these results, while encouraging, should not be taken to mean that the treatment is so dramatic that everyone should be given it,"" said Stephen Evans, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study.  -- Reuters",GMA News

""When it comes to self-preservation, when your life is a stake, it brings out the best and the worst in us. Kaya kanya-kanyang decision-making na yan,"" he added.
Republic Act 9711 or the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009, nevertheless, explicitly prohibits the ""manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertising"" of any unregistered health product.
In the end, Dela Rosa said he himself would be willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, so long as it is ""with the highest efficacy.""
""Maganda sana kung yung magandang brand, nandito na sa atin at sigurado tayo. Kung available yun, merong Pfizer, kung available na sa public yan, edi pupuntahan natin yung pinakamaganda,"" he said.

Speaking to reporters after the Rizal Day ceremony in Manila, Lorenzana said the arrival of the first vaccine against COVID-19 to the country is expected in May of next year ""at the earliest.""
He also said the unregistered vaccine used on Presidential Security Group (PSG) personnel was not enough to cover medical frontliners, who complained about the alleged prioritization of soldiers in the vaccine efforts.
""Ito naman kasing dumating, ilang tao lang sa PSG, wala pang 300 'yan eh, so kung sila ay nagtatampo na 'yung PSG [na-prioritize], 'di naman siguro sapat kahit 500 o 1,000, hindi sapat para mabigyan lahat ng frontliners,"" said Lorenzana, who chairs the National Task Force on COVID-19.

Galvez made the statement at a Senate hearing two days after he signed a term sheet with the Serum Institute of India for some 30 million doses of the vaccine Covovax.
The Covovax vaccine is currently in the third-stage trials carried out in the United Kingdom with 15,000 subjects, as well as in the United States and Mexico with 30,000 subjects. It also underwent trials in Australia, South Africa, and India.
The vaccine is set to arrive in the country by the third quarter of 2021.

Galvez also said that the Philippines will get 25 million doses of a Chinese vaccine ""on time.""
Amid criticism that the government has taken so long to procure a vaccine, Galvez said that the first delivery of a vaccine to the country is expected on February 20.
This means, he said, that the first COVID-19 vaccination in the Philippines will be in the last week of February.
""The supply and demand is very volatile. The delivery is on general terms, tinatawag na indicative dates. The indicative dates, it might fall early, or delivery will be late by one week or two weeks. Safe to say, we will be having maybe last week of February,"" he said.
The Philippines has allocated P73.2 billion for the procurement of the vaccines for 60 million Filipinos. Galvez, during the day's Senate hearing, said the bulk of the supply will come from US drug maker Novavax.
In the same hearing, Department of Health (DOH) Secretary Francisco Duque III said the government has identified 4,512 fixed vaccination points in the country where COVID-19 immunization will be conducted.

“To simulate first the COVID rollout, we will be using the measles vaccination using COVID protocols and guidelines that we’re trying to finalize. Using that, we can see also what gaps to address with regards to inoculation proper,” Joseph Juico, co-chair of the city’s Vax to Normal Task Force, told GMA News on Tuesday.
The city is training with the Department of Health for the program. The simulation will cover not just the actual vaccination on site, but also other logistical concerns.
“This is not just for site simulation but also vaccine chain, supply chain simulation, data encoding simulation for those that will be vaccinated. That’s in partnership with a third party private component. And they would also be our partners for the monitoring of patients, adverse events, and so on,” Juico said.
The task force has already identified six of 24 proposed vaccination sites: the Project 6 Tennis Court in District 1; the Batasan Hills National High School and the National Government Center covered court in District 2; the Aguinaldo Elementary School in District 3; the Doña Josefa High School and the Diosdado Macapagal Elementary School in District 4; the Kaligayahan Activity Center and the Fairview covered court in District 5; and the Emilio Jacinto Elementary School and the Culiat High School in District 6.

“They are basketball courts, schools, because one of the recommendations of the Department of Health and the WHO for mass inoculation, it has to be an open area, covered open area with free flow yung hangin dapat, well ventilated,” Juico said.
The city has also identified two possible storage areas for the COVID-19 vaccines: the JC Vaccine Storage along Edsa and the Quezon City Health Department warehouse near the Amoranto Stadium.
When asked about the challenges the local government is facing in the COVID vaccination program, Juico identified manpower as the number one issue.
“Per vaccine site, we need about 22 to 23 people per site. That’s a mix of doctors, nurses, allied personnel. You’re talking about security, you’re talking about marshals. And then you have to populate all of the 24 ideal sites that we would like to put. Second is data gathering talaga. Getting the people to the actual site. That’s another challenge.

At present only Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca have secured the emergency use authority (EUA) in the Philippines, with supplies expected in the first quarter of the year.
However, President Rodrigo Duterte in December said several Filipinos — including members of the military, particularly the Presidential Security Group — received COVID-19 vaccines from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm even without approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Indemnification
Meanwhile, Drilon said Congress was open to passing a measure that would indemnify COVID-19 vaccines from possible side effects given the immediate need for such medicines.
""Isa sa pinag–uusapan yung tinatawag nating indemnification at payag naman ang Kongreso na sagutin ng pamahalaan ito dahilan sa hinihingi ito ng mga manufacturers na kailangan wala silang liability. Ito ay dahilan sa hindi pa naman fully licensed ito kaso dahil sa pandemic kailangan na. Payag naman po ang Kongreso na magkaroon na sasagutin ang indemnification kung anuman ang danyos o yung mga side effects dahil sa bakuna,"" he said.
Another way was to put a free and harmless clause that would dictate that the national government will hold the manufacturers free and harmless from any claim.

But the senator said she found it disturbing that the vaccine czar openly admitted that he was lying to the public.
Galvez, however, denied that he did.

""As pastors, we have to call attention to one ethical concern. We have learned that some of the COVID-19 vaccines were manufactured using cells obtained from the remains of an aborted female fetus who was killed in 1973,"" the bishops said in a statement.
""The perennial teaching of the Church must be repeated: Deliberately procuring abortion, even if it is for the purpose of obtaining material for vaccines, is morally unacceptable.

(DMI) to provide specialized mobile, hybrid containers that could be utilized in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippine market.
The partnership will make the MCF8 — a mobile, hybrid container that allows for the proper freezing, transport, storage, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines — available in the country starting the first quarter of 2021.
""Vaccine manufacturers, governments, hospitals, and local communities are facing significant challenges in transporting, storing, and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine options due to the requirement of maintaining a constant temperature from -20°C down to -80°C in order to retain their effectiveness. Currently, very few options are available to handle the distribution requirements of these vaccines,"" Enrico Klauer, chief executive officer of MECOTEC, said in an emailed statement.
""Through our partnership with DMI, we aim to help equip the Philippines with an effective solution that addresses these concerns as the local distribution of COVID-19 vaccines are on the horizon,"" he added.
According to the firm, the MCF8 has ISO container sizes of 20 to 40 feet that meet current transport standards for truck, railway, ship, and air, which can store up to a million vaccination doses in one 40-foot container and up to 500,000 doses in a 20-foot container.

""With MECOTEC’s technology, we can efficiently address these concerns, and even reach smaller and more remote communities,"" he added.
The Philippines has already allocated P73.2 billion for the procurement of the vaccines, with P40 billion coming from multilateral agencies, P20 billion from domestic sources, and P13.2 billion from bilateral agreements.
Over the weekend, the Philippines through vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. inked a term sheet to secure some 30 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine Covovax, set to arrive in the country by the third quarter of 2021.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Sunday also said the country has secured some 25 million doses of the vaccine manufactured by Chinese firm Sinovac, even as the medicine has less efficacy and is more expensive than others.
Amid questions over its seeming ""preference"" for Sinovac, the government said that it does not favor any company and that the Sinovac vaccine is safe.
Meanwhile, the private sector has committed to procuring as much as 6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, half of which will be donated to the Philippine government. —KG, GMA News",GMA News

Teresita Ang See, a Chinese-Filipino, said the vaccinations started as early as November last year but she had no idea how the Chinese-developed vaccine was brought into the Philippines.
She said most of the Chinese nationals who received the vaccine work for Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).
“Okay lang sa akin na mabakunahan sila because we don’t have much control [over] them. Wala tayong basis to touch base with them, especially the POGO workers,” Ang See said on Tapatan sa Aristocrat forum.
“I’m glad that they are being vaccinated because it protects us also if they’re protected.”
Ang See said these Chinese nationals had confidence in the vaccine.
Sought for comment, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque and Philippine Ambassador to China Jose “Chito” Sta. Romana said they could not confirm the veracity of Ang See’s statement.
“Wala po akong impormasyon,” Roque said at a press briefing even as he welcomed the vaccinations.
“Kung totoo man eh di mabuti. [We have] 100,000 less possible carriers of COVID-19,” he said.
Sta. Romana, for his part, said: “Unless they came back to China and had the vaccination here in China, as to whether they were brought out of China, I cannot confirm or deny. I certainly don’t know.”

Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte said some Filipino soldiers, who were later identified as members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG), got the vaccine — even though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved any COVID-19 vaccine for use in the Philippines.

At a press briefing, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the compassionate use will cover 10,000 doses.
“It (getting Sinopharm) was a decision of PSG,” Roque said.
Roque, however, did not provide further details on how the PSG will procure the vaccines, saying he does not have that information.
Pressed why Sinopharm was the PSG’s choice, Roque pointed to the delayed delivery of COVID-19 vaccines Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca which were scheduled to arrive in the country mid February via the COVAX facility—a global effort which raised resources to fund COVID-19 response initiatives, including COVID-19 vaccines.

“I think the answer is obvious ‘no, wala tayong nakukuhang supply pa sa ngayon ng Pfizer at saka ng AstraZeneca, naantala nga po iyong pagdating na inaasahan natin na mid-February at ngayon inaasahan natin either third or fourth week,” Roque said.
A vaccine needs to secure an emergency use authorization from the FDA for it to be legally administered in the Philippines. Sinopharm has yet to apply for an EUA before the FDA.
The FDA, however, can allow the use of the vaccine without EUA approval provided that the vaccine secured a compassionate use permit.
Some members of PSG, however, have already received COVID-19 shots that were donated to them as early as September or October last year, according to PSG commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III in December.
Durante made the admission after President Rodrigo Duterte claimed during a televised address that some members of the military received shots of COVID-19 vaccine supposedly manufactured by  Sinopharm.
Last January 27, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the probe on PSG members getting inoculated with unregistered COVID-19 vaccine has hit a blank wall after their queries went unanswered by the PSG.
Illegal vaccination probe
In a separate statement sent to GMA News Online on Thursday, Domingo clarified that the issuance of compassionate use for Sinopharm does not absolve the PSG of possible liability over their admission that they vaccinated themselves with an unregistered Sinopharm vaccine in September and October last year.
“[The compassionate use permit is] for future use. The investigation is still being pursued,” Domingo said.
Likewise, Domingo underscored that the FDA’s issuance of permit for compassionate use is not tantamount to FDA’s stamp of approval.
“The PSG applied and complied with all requirements for the CSP. It was granted yesterday and the PSG Hospital takes full responsibility for the vaccines and will report utilization and outcomes to FDA,” Domingo pointed out.
“The CSP (compassionate special permit) is for future use and the permit is for one time importation,” Domingo added.
The PSG, Domingo said, applied for the CSP permit for Sinopharm last January 18.
Ultimately, Roque said that the PSG deserves to get the COVID-19 vaccine immediately because such is necessary to protect the President.
“Kaya nga po compassionate use dahil kinakailangan mabakunahan na iyong ibang miyembro pa ng PSG dahil nga po sa kanilang trabaho na nagbibigay seguridad sa ating Presidente,” Roque said. — KBK/RSJ, GMA News

The government's vaccine efforts however was rocked by controversy recently when it was learned that some military members of the Presidential Security Group have already been administered with an unregistered COVID-19 vaccine.
The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced if not shut down businesses, decimating employment and mass transport, due to the ban on mass gathering and social distancing required to prevent COVID-19 transmission.
PSG Commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III said the vaccine was a donation and given to them for free, but he refused to identify the source. The Food and Drug Administration is already looking into the matter.
This comes amid reports of clandestine vaccination operations against COVID-19 in the National Capital Region, which is now being investigated by the National Bureau of Investigation.
The Philippines has registered 472,532 COVID-19 cases as of December 30, 2020. Of this number, 439,509 recovered while 9,230 died. The number of active COVID-19 cases is at 23,793. —KBK, GMA News",GMA News

Beijing Biological Products Institute Co. Ltd said it had applied to the National Medical Products Administration for conditional approval of the vaccine.
The result is based on interim analysis of data from its Phase III clinical trial, but the firm did not give details such as the number of infections in the trial.
President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said over the weekend that many Filipinos, including some from the military, have already received a COVID-19 vaccine from Sinopharm even as it has yet to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque however said on Monday Duterte did not authorize the vaccination of soldiers with Sinopharm’s experimental vaccine against COVID-19.
“I don’t think so. It must have been the decision of the commanders and the soldiers,” Roque said at a news conference.
The Presidential Security Group, which is tasked to provide security detail for the President, said some of their personnel received COVID-19 vaccines starting September, adding that the vaccines were donated. However, they declined to mention the source.
The FDA said donations of COVID-19 vaccines still require clearances from the agency before they are brought to the country.
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the COVID-19 vaccines administered to some members of the PSG were smuggled because no authorization was given by the FDA.

Thousands of variants have been documented as the virus mutates, including the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants which appear to spread more swiftly than others.
British Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it was very unlikely that the current vaccines would not work against the new variants.
""Its very unlikely that the current vaccine won't be effective on the variants whether in Kent or other variants especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalization,"" Zahawi told Sky News.
""All manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others, are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant—there are about 4,000 variants around the world of COVID now.""

While thousands of variants have arisen as the virus mutates on replication, only a very small minority are likely to be important and to change the virus in an appreciable way, according to the British Medical Journal.
The so called British variant, known as VUI-202012/01, has mutations including a change in the spike protein that viruses use to bind to the human ACE2 receptor—meaning that it is probably easier to catch.
""We have the largest genome sequencing industry—we have about 50% of the world's genome sequencing industry—and we are keeping a library of all the variants so that we are ready to respond—whether in the autumn or beyond—to any challenge that the virus may present and produce the next vaccine,"" Zahawi said.
Vaccine race
The novel coronavirus—known as SARS-CoV-2—has killed 2.268 million people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019, according to Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.
Israel is currently far ahead of the rest of the world on vaccinations per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, the United States and then Spain, Italy and Germany.
Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca are combined in a two-shot schedule.
The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of vaccines could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.
The trial will examine the immune responses of an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca's, as well as vice versa, with intervals of four and 12 weeks.
Both the mRNA shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech and the adenovirus viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are currently being rolled out in Britain, with a 12-week gap between two doses of the same vaccine. — Reuters",GMA News

China approved its first COVID-19 vaccine for general public use on Thursday, a shot developed by an affiliate to state-backed Sinopharm, after the developer said the vaccine showed 79.34 percent efficacy based on an interim analysis of late-stage clinical trials.
That rate is lower than the 86 percent rate for the same vaccine reported by the United Arab Emirates on Dec. 9.
Countries have certain differences in their standards and procedures in diagnosing patients, and the final results of COVID-19 case identification were different, Yang Xiaoming, chairman at Sinopharm unit's CNBG, told Global Times, a tabloid published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party.
""Therefore, there were differences between the comprehensive multi-country data we reviewed and the protection rate data previously evaluated by the UAE and Bahrain,"" Global Times quoted Yang as saying in a report published on Thursday.

An Executive Order issued by President Rodrigo Duterte in November 2020 has allowed the FDA to issue an EUA on COVID-19 vaccines within 21 days since the vaccine-maker submitted its EUA application, provided that such vaccine already secured an EUA from other regulatory bodies classified as a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) by the World Health Organization.
AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, which it developed with Oxford University and administered in two doses, has posted an efficacy rate of 90% after human trials.
AstraZeneca has already secured an EUA in the United Kingdom whose regulatory authority is considered SRA by WHO.
The Philippine FDA earlier granted EUA to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after it was found to be 95% and 92% effective in a study population and among all races, respectively.
Likewise, the FDA said that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine can be administered to 16 years old and above and that its side effects were found to be transient, mild to moderate and similar to common vaccine reactions.

This makes AstraZeneca, a British pharmaceutical firm, the second company to secure an EUA in the Philippines after Pfizer BioNTech.
Domingo said AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, which it developed with Oxford University, has posted an efficacy rate of 70% after first dose.
“All conditions for EUA are present, and the benefit of using the vaccine outweighs potential risk,” Domingo said during the day's Laging Handa briefing.
“The interim data, taken in its entirety, showed an efficacy rate of 70% after the first dose. Tumataas ito pagkatapos bigyan ng second dose, depende rin sa length of time kung kelan ibinigay iyong second dose,” he added.

Domingo also said that AstraZeneca initially showed it is very effective in preventing severe COVID-19 infection.
“Iyong data ng AstraZeneca showed it is very good in preventing severe COVID-19, halos 100% rin. Kaya lang maliit pa ang datos nila, at maa-update pa ‘yan. So iyong 70% [na efficacy after first dose], kahit may nagkasakit [ng COVID-19], hindi grabe,” he added.
Domingo said that the two doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine can be administered four to 12 weeks apart on individuals aged 18 years and above. The vaccine can only be administered by the vaccine providers determined by the Department of Health.
The FDA Chief, however, clarified that close monitoring and surveillance is still needed after immunization.
AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccin has posted an efficacy rate of 90% after human trials ahead of the Philippine FDA evaluation. Human trials abroad showed that it is 70% effective after two standard doses, but it improved to 90% after the first dose was reduced to half.
Domingo, however, said that AstraZeneca’s vaccine’s potential to reach a higher efficacy rate was not dependent on the amount of doses administered.
“Tuloy tuloy pa po ang clinical trials [for AstraZeneca’s vaccine], but currently it does not depend on half dose then standard dose, or standard dose then [another standard dose]. It is more [dependent] on the time difference between first and second doses,” he said.
As for adverse effects of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, Domingo said they were transient and mild to moderate, similar to a regular vaccine.
“Ang pananakit doon sa lugar ng injection, konting sinat, konting sakit na ulo...that can all be easily managed. Walang special na precaution up to date kasi walang specific safety concerns na naidentify,” Domingo said.
The Philippines has already inked a supply deal for 17 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca so far, a number that is good for around 8.5 million individuals since it is administered in two doses. These AstraZeneca doses, however, are expected to arrive only by June this year.
AstraZeneca, which only requires a standard storage temperature of 2°C to 8°C, has already secured an EUA in the United Kingdom whose regulatory authority is considered a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) by the World Health Organization.
An Executive Order issued by President Rodrigo Duterte in November 2020 has allowed the FDA to issue an EUA on COVID-19 vaccines within 21 days since the vaccine-maker submitted its EUA application, provided that such vaccine already secured an EUA from other regulatory bodies classified as SRA by WHO.

Robredo’s spokesperson, Ibarra Gutierrez, issued the statement in response to Senator Bong Go’s challenge that the Vice President get the COVID-19 vaccine with President Rodrigo Duterte.
“As early as the first week of December, Vice President Leni already declared her willingness to receive the vaccine in public to encourage all Filipinos to get vaccinated,” Gutierrez said.
“In her view, the government should have two priorities on this issue: ensuring the availability of a safe, effective, and affordable vaccine, and ensuring that as many Filipinos as possible receive it. She is more than ready to do her part in attaining these goals,” Gutierrez added.
Duterte earlier said that he is willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine first to enjoin the public to do the same, but he has since said that he would take it last to give way to health workers, elderly and the poor.

Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, Jr. then said that the President will get the COVID-19 vaccine in private like England’s Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh—members of the Royal Family.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said that intensified information drive on benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine can increase vaccine confidence from an existing 60% to as much as 85%.
Only Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has secured an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration so far.
In granting EUA, the FDA said that Pfizer-BioNTech has been found 95% and 92% effective on study population and among all races, respectively—a requirement before a vaccine can be administered in the country.
Back in November 2018, vaccine confidence in the country nosedived from 92% to 33% after officials of Sanofi Pasteur—manufacturer of anti-dengue vaccine dengvaxia—announced that their vaccine posed a risk to those who were not infected by dengue prior to being injected with the vaccine.
The announcement, however, only came after the vaccine has already been administered to over 700,000 children and even policemen.
There were at least 100 individuals who died after receiving the dengvaxia vaccine, but health officials have ruled that their deaths cannot be directly linked to the vaccine.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Sanofi returned P1.16 billion to the Department of Health for the unused doses of vaccine. — RSJ, GMA News",GMA News

In a statement on Tuesday, Gatchalian said that he is willing to get a Sinovac's CoronaVac if allowed under the government's prioritization framework.
“Alam ko may prioritization tayo ngayon. Kung hindi naman lalabag dito, I would volunteer to be vaccinated by Sinovac. This is to show to the public our support to the vaccination program,” he said.
Gatchalian said he sent word to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. over the weekend on his willingness to get a Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.
He added that he wanted to get CoronaVac to dispel notions that politicians want vaccines with higher efficacy rates.

“What’s more important to me is the seal of approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If it’s approved by the FDA, which went through tedious analysis prior to the grant of authorization for emergency use, I’m okay with it,"" Gatchalian said.
""I’m okay with any brand of anti-COVID-19 vaccine. I’m not brand conscious. I put my trust in the FDA,” he added.
A total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, just about a week after the FDA granted it emergency use authorization.
FDA director general Dr. Eric Domingo said Sinovac’s efficacy ranged from 65.3% to 91.2% but only reached 50.4% among health workers with COVID-19 exposure.
This makes it not recommended for health workers, he added.
“This should be administered by vaccination providers and to prevent COVID-19 in clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old,” Domingo had said.
However, Domingo clarified on Tuesday that health workers can still choose to get vaccinated with Sinovac since they merely made a recommendation on which groups it is not suited for.
Prior to the vaccination drive on Monday, a nationwide survey conducted by OCTA Research group showed that only 19% of adult Filipinos want to get a COVID-19 vaccine while 46% said they do not want to be vaccinated against the illness.
But Gatchalian believes this could change as more and more Filipinos will likely to receive Sinovac COVID-19 shots in the coming days.

Interviewed on Super Radyo dzBB, Domingo said the regulatory enforcement unit has yet to submit a report but pointed out they are looking into more details about the vaccination.

“Saan ba nanggaling ang bakuna? Kung ano ba 'yung assurance natin na totoong bakuna 'yun at na-handle siya properly bago itinurok sa mga, allegedly, sundalo,” he added

“Dahil ang Army po ang mismong nagsabi, na ito pong head ng Philippine Army is mukhang nagsabi na merong nabakunahan so at least siya po maaari naming hingan ng impormasyon tsaka sa PSG,” he said.
Asked about Cabinet members who allegedly received the vaccine as claimed by Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, Domingo said he is not privy about it.
Domingo said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also does not know who among the Cabinet officials have received the vaccine, and that he is not one of them.
On Saturday, President Rodrigo Duterte said some military personnel have already received a COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer Sinopharm, which has no approval yet from the FDA.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines, after an internal inquiry, said those who received the vaccine were members of the Presidential Security Group.
Domingo said Sinopharm has yet to contact the FDA regarding possible application.
“Ang Sinopharm po kasi hindi pa lumalapit sa FDA. Wala pa po silang application na kahit ano dito sa Pilipinas tapos wala po silang representative dito sa Pilipinas,” he said.
Domingo added that the FDA will try to communicate with the Chinese manufacturer through the Chinese Embassy.
Domingo also said he finds it shocking than an unregulated vaccine has been reportedly used on military personnel and Cabinet members.
“Ito naman po ay ginagawa kasi natin to assure 'yung safety and quality po ng bakuna na gagamitin o ng gamot,” he said.
“Kaya nga po nakakagulat naman na may nangyaring ganoon na hindi man lang natin po nalaman sana man lang nasigurado po natin na na-handle properly and that it goes through a proper mean,” he added.
Domingo said the process of acquiring the vaccine could have been made legal only if the manufacturer applied for a “compassionate special permit,” which is issued to medicines for emergency and research purposes. The same permit was given to potential COVID-19 medicine Remdesivir for a clinical trial in the Philippines.
Philippine laws prohibit the manufacturing, importation, exportation, sale, distribution, and non-consumer use of unregistered products, according to FDA.

Researchers are racing to establish whether the vaccines currently being rolled out across the globe are effective against the so-called 501Y.V2 variant, identified by South African genomics experts late last year in Nelson Mandela Bay.
""This lineage exhibits complete escape from three classes of therapeutically relevant monoclonal antibodies,"" the team of scientists from three South African universities working with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) wrote in a paper in bioRxiv, a website that publishes scientific research prior to its being peer-reviewed and submitted to journals.
""Furthermore, 501Y.V2 shows substantial or complete escape from neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"" they wrote, adding that their conclusions ""highlight the prospect of reinfection ... and may foreshadow reduced efficacy of current spike-based vaccines.""
The 501Y.V2 variant is 50% more infectious than previous ones, South African researchers said this week. It has already spread to at least 20 countries since being reported to the World Health Organization in late December.

The variant is the main driver of South Africa's second wave of COVID-19 infections, which hit a new daily peak above 21,000 cases earlier this month, far above the first wave, before falling to about 12,000 a day.
Convalescent blood plasma from previous patients has not been shown to be effective when administered to severely ill patients requiring intensive care for COVID-19, but it is approved in several countries as an emergency measure.
British scientists and politicians have expressed concern that vaccines currently being deployed or in development could be less effective against the variant.
The paper said it remained to be seen how effective current vaccines were against 501Y.V2, which would only be determined by large-scale clinical trials. But results showed the need for new vaccines to be designed to tackle the evolving threat, it said. -- Reuters",GMA News

Evaluation begins right away
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will immediately begin evaluating the results of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine clinical trials conducted by Pfizer/BioNTech.
They will concentrate on the safety of the vaccine and its effectiveness, which has been billed at 95 percent by Pfizer/BioNTech.
FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said the approval process will include a public meeting of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, which includes experts in infectious diseases, pediatrics, biostatistics and industry representatives.

The committee's recommendations are not binding, however, and a final decision on whether or not to authorize the vaccine will be up to the scientists at the FDA.
Green light: December
The FDA could provide emergency authorization as soon as the first two weeks of December, according to Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist for ""Operation Warp Speed,"" the US government initiative to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.
It would be a conditional approval in the context of the global health crisis and would restrict distribution of the vaccine to certain members of the population.
Children, for example, would not be included because Pfizer has not yet conducted widespread testing of the vaccine among those under the age of 18.
Another US government agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), would determine the order of priority for distribution of the vaccine.
Front-line medical workers and elderly residents of nursing homes would probably be among the first to be inoculated.
In Europe, Britain, Canada, Japan and Australia, the process is slightly different and regulators there have been constantly reviewing the data from clinical trials being conducted by several manufacturers.
The European Union could give a green light to a vaccine as early as the second half of December, according to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.
Distribution: late December
Pfizer/BioNTech said doses of the vaccine would be ready for distribution ""within hours"" after US authorization, which could mean shipments beginning in the second half of December.
They would initially be provided by a US factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and a Belgian plant in Puurs.
The vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), temperatures much colder than those of a standard freezer.
Pfizer would distribute the doses to vaccination centers in containers filled with dry ice which should keep the vaccine at the required temperature for 15 days.
Next vaccines: early 2021
The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine could be ready for distribution soon after that of Pfizer/BioNTech and could be followed by February by that of Johnson & Johnson, according to Slaoui, with AstraZeneca/Oxford also expected in the next few months.
While high-risk groups will be the first vaccinated, the US government hopes that there will be enough vaccines by April 2021 to offer it to the broader population and provide high coverage by the summer.  -- Agence France-Presse",GMA News

The association said the expected administration of the Sinovac vaccine at PGH was met with a “sweeping disapproval rate of 95 percent” among the hospital's residents and fellows.
Although Sinovac was given EUA by the FDA, it was not recommended for healthcare workers due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4% for the group.
Still, the Department of Health has said the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group has agreed to recommend Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccines for health workers.
“We recognize the efforts of the PGH Administration in hastening the vaccination process for its constituents. However, the vaccination plan should have been handled with more prudence and transparency,” the PGH Physicians' Association said.
“As the national university hospital, PGH should set an example on how vaccination rollout should be executed in the country. PGH should uphold the ideals of ethical and evidence-based medicine, for which it has been a bastion of,” it added.
Indemnity fund
Last Friday, Duterte also signed into law the Vaccination Program Act of 2021 which would expedite the rollout of the country's vaccination program against COVID-19.
The measure also provides a P500-million indemnity fund for individuals who will experience adverse effects after getting the jab.
Galvez welcomed the passage of the law, saying that it would provide flexibility and indemnity in the procurement and administration of the vaccines.
""[With this], we shall be able to accelerate the implementation of our national vaccination program and finally put an end to this health crisis and revive our nation’s economy,"" he said.

Vargas made the remark as several local governments --including Manila and Caloocan City --have set up pre-registration websites for those who want to avail of COVID vaccines once the doses become available in the country.
In a Dobol B sa News TV interview, Vargas said that while LGUs' vaccination efforts are laudable, there is a need to know why they are conducting online pre-registration instead of just validating the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) list.
""Dapat kasi sa LGU, tahanan sila ng senior citizens, at yung tinatawag na indigents o mahihirap. So ano yung purpose ng pre-registration? Hindi ba dapat more on validation?"" he said.
""I think what's more important is validation of the list. Kasi kapag nandiyan na yung bakuna, pipila, babakunahan, napakalaking operation nito. Kasama dapat ito sa ground work na ginagawa ngayon habang hindi pa dumarating ang bakuna,"" he added.

On January 1, the city government of Manila announced that it was opening a website where residents could pre-register to get COVID-19 vaccine for free.
Eleven days later, Manila City Mayor Isko Moreno announced that a tripartite deal had already been signed with the national government and AstraZeneca for the acquisition of 800,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine for the city's residents.
Vargas said that while local governments are awaiting the arrival of the vaccines, they should already be doing the validation of the priority list.
According to the government's vaccination roadmap, health workers and frontliners will be the first to receive the vaccine, followed by employees of select government offices, indigent senior citizens, and other indigents.

WHO country representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the study that found reduced efficacy of the AstraZeneca jab on patients with the South Africa variant only had a “very small sample” of less than 2,000 people. 
“We still believe that the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective even in places where you have a large proportion of cases which could be attributed to the B.1.351 or the South Africa variant,” he said in a virtual briefing.
A molecular biologist on Wednesday warned that the AstraZeneca shot could be rendered ineffective if the Philippines fails to curb the spread of the South Africa variant. 
The Department of Health earlier explained that the new variant is more transmissible and contains a mutation that could cause reduced vaccine efficacy.

Ho said a similar study on childhood vaccination conducted two years ago also found that health workers influence public confidence in inoculation.
“Do’n sa third party na nag-study for us, actually ‘yung top 3 main influencers for people to get vaccinated are one, DOH; two, their healthcare providers; and three is their family or relatives. That’s two years ago,” she said.

But the health official said there is no urgent need for government officials to get vaccinated since health workers are being prioritized in the rollout.
“It might be needed, but considering the first group of people that we’re vaccinating sa hierarchy natin ng priority, mas kailangan natin ng other healthcare worker influencers,” Ho explained.

Galvez made the statement a day after the United Kingdom started its mass COVID-19 vaccination program on Tuesday with a vaccine supply from Pfizer proven to be 95% effective after human trials.
""Our target this year is 25 million. Based on the availability of the vaccine, we can expand it to 30 to 35 million,” he said in an ANC interview.
Of the said number, Galvez said health care and other essential workers account for around three million.
The Philippines has only secured 2.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British firm AstraZeneca thus far, a volume which is only good for one million people.

As this developed, the Philippine government is still negotiating on securing COVID-19 vaccine supply from pharmaceutical firms Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, Sinovac, and Gamaleya, among others.
Only COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna (both 95%) and AstraZeneca (90%) have been proven largely effective after human trials so far.
The Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration, however, is yet to issue an emergency use authorization on any COVID-19 vaccine.
Galvez asked the public for patience, saying that it is expected that countries with more resources and the country of origin of the COVID-19 vaccines found over 90% effective such as Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca will prioritize its residents since their governments also financed the development of the vaccines.
“Sila po ang nag-finance, sa kanila po galing iyong bakuna, kaya sila po talaga ang mauunang mag-roll out [for mass vaccination],” he said.
“Ang nakikita po natin sa Pfizer at sa iba pang leading vaccines, iyong production po nila for first and second quarter nakuha na po ng rich countries. Ang natitira po sa atin, mga last portion of second quarter to third quarter [darating]. Iyon po ang reality,” he added.
Still, Galvez is confident that the mass COVID-19 vaccination in the country can begin in March or April, starting with vaccines from Chinese firms Sinovac and CanSino.
“These are already approved for emergency use authorization in China and we will ask them to increase their volume [of production for the Philippines] since they will also conduct a clinical trial here,” he said.
“Sana makuha natin ng by first quarter of next year. We are still in negotiation, but there is more confidence in Sinovac because they already gave 1.8 million and 1.2 million doses COVID-19 vaccines in Brazil and Indonesia,” he added.

Margaret Keenan received the jab at about 6:45 a.m., marking the start of a historic mass vaccination program.
Parsons said it was a “huge honor” to be the first in the UK to deliver the vaccine to a patient.
“I’m just glad that I’m able to play a part in this historic day. The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,” Parsons, who has worked in the NHS for 24 years, said.

Vaccines will be administered at 50 hospital hubs in the UK with patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as  an outpatient and those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay first in line to receive it, the report said.

“If we do not eliminate the B.1.351 variant in the Philippines, which was first identified yesterday in Pasay, the 17 million doses of AstraZeneca that we have already bought but have not yet arrived will be ineffective against fighting this particular variant from South Africa,” he added.

The government plans to purchase one million Sinovac doses this month to augment the 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government.
Doctors from the Philippine General Hospital as well as Vice President Leni Robredo earlier called for an HTAC review of the Sinovac jab to ensure “informed decision-making.”
Duque maintained that the law does not mandate an HTAC evaluation for donated vaccines.
“In the first place, the safety efficacy evaluation is the mandate of the FDA. So the HTAC is really an economic tool to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the vaccines. But because this is not to be procured, the FDA evaluation of risk-benefit analysis suffices,” he said.
The HTAC has already cleared the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines, millions of doses of which will be donated to the Philippines by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility.
“The difference is AstraZeneca and Pfizer had submitted their trial data much earlier and these trial data were published in journals so there was time for HTAC to do it,” Duque said.
Dr. Ernesto Domingo, a Ramon Magsaysay Awardee and a professor at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine, for his part, said that the Sinovac vaccine does not need an HTAC appraisal before it could be given to healthcare workers in accordance with the Universal Healthcare Law.
""No, my answer is you don't need the HTAC to go over this for the vaccine to be given. So I agree, the rollout, it should continue,"" said  at a Palace briefing.
""It's all there. We know what it is supposed to do, what it can do, what we have to be aware of,"" Domingo added, saying other international bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), have given their approval for Sinovac.
""When it comes to our place, our own FDA (Food and Drug Administration) said 'Yes you can use it.' I don't see any reason why it should be subjected to HTAC discussion,"" Domingo said.

In effect, the vaccine passport will serve as proof that the holder is safe to mingle with other people and engage in activities even without wearing face masks or face shields and observing social distancing.
Under the measure, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19, particularly the Department of Health, Department of Tourism, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department of Transportation, is mandated to “coordinate and provide for a single internationally-recognized vaccine passport to serve as proof that a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19.”
The said vaccine passport should be issued ""as a matter of right whether or not the person availed of the free vaccination program of the government or was vaccinated through personal and other means.""
Contents of the vaccine passport should include the basic personal information of the holder such as full name, address, date of birth; type and purpose of vaccine, batch number, date administered and the name of the entity that administered the vaccine; and other relevant medical information.
The IATF is also mandated under the measure to list down and regularly update the exemptions or activities allowed for holders of the COVID-19 vaccine passport, including:

According to Duque, the succeeding batches are expected to arrive until the end of 2021, to complement those from British firm AstraZeneca.
""We sealed the deal with Sinovac for 25 million with early 50,000 doses by February, 950,000 by March and 2 to 3 million in succeeding months 'til December with 25 million doses. This is in addition to AstraZeneca as confirmed by Sec. Galvez,"" he was quoted as saying in a report by Mai Bermudez on GMA's ""24 Oras Weekend"" on Sunday.
COVID-19 policy chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. last week said the Philippines targets to vaccinate some 50 to 70 million Filipinos from COVID-19 this year.
""We hope to close the deal with these companies this month,"" he said, as other government officials earlier said the country would have already had the shipment this January if not for Health Secretary Francisco Duque III who dropped the ball and failed to submit the necessary documents.

In response, Duque earlier said that ""there is no such this as dropping the ball"" as he said negotiations are still ongoing.
The Philippines has already allocated P73.2 billion for the procurement of the vaccines, with P40 billion coming from multilateral agencies, P20 billion from domestic sources, and P13.2 billion from bilateral agreements.
Meanwhile, the private sector has committed to procuring as much as 6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, half of which will be donated to the Philippine government.
Aside from this, the Philippines over the weekend inked the term sheet to secure 30 million doses of the Covovax vaccine to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), which has partnered with Faberco Life Sciences Inc. as its Philippine partner. — Jon Viktor D.

Sinovac is administered in two doses and has been found to have an efficacy rate of 65% to 91% among clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old, based on the findings of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA  granted emergency use authorization to Sinovac on Monday but did not recommend it for health workers, the top priority in the vaccination program, due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4% in the said group.
The donation of China of 600,000 doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines will arrive at 5 p.m. on Sunday afternoon in the country. Of this number, 100,000 doses were reserved for the Armed Forces of the Philippines tapped to secure the transport of COVID-19 vaccines to health care facilities.
President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to welcome the arrival of the vaccines, together with other officials, at the Villamor Airbase.
""Excited na kami dahil bukas dadating na po ang bakuna,"" Roque said.
Roque added he will also be there together with Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go and other Cabinet officials.

At least 38,400 doses more from AstraZeneca are expected to arrive on Sunday.
With around 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine that will be delivered until May, Galvez said the country will have 1.5 million doses every month.
On the other hand, the Department of Health on Saturday convened members of different hospitals in Metro Manila for a meeting to address the recent spike in hospital admissions amid the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the country.
The Philippines began its COVID-19 vaccination program on March 1, following the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines, which was immediately followed by 487,000 doses from AstraZeneca.

“There’s a task force for the vaccine. The role of NEDA there, we are a member there. I actually offered to the task force, that Secretary (Carlito) Galvez is heading, the possibility of using the National ID as one of the basis for the distribution [of the vaccine],” Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua said during the virtual Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum.
“The vaccine is really a health response and NEDA is not a health expert or vaccine expert but because of the National ID we can help in that aspect,” Chua said.
Nearly 25 million Filipinos composed of frontline health workers, the poor and uniformed personnel will be among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as the country eyes to begin its mass immunization program within the first half of 2021.
National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said that the government is targeting to inoculate 60% to 70% of the population, which be sufficient to create herd immunity.

The national ID, on the other hand, is prioritizing the registration of nine million low-income household heads from 32 priority provinces.
The select provinces include Ilocos Sur, La Union, Pangasinan, Cagayan, Isabela, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Zambales, Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Quezon, Rizal, Albay, Camarines Sur, Masbate, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Davao de Oro, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Leyte, and Tawi-tawi.
“As of December 11, we have already registered 8.7 million for Step 1. We are hoping by the end of the year we will exceed 10 million,” Chua said.
The Step 1 of PhilSys registration involves the house-to-house collection of the demographic information of low-income household heads in the priority provinces.
“Step 2, we will begin in January... Step 3, starting Feb they will get their national ID,” the NEDA chief said.
The Philippine Statistics Authority is set to begin Step 2 of PhilSys registration, which will involve the capture of biometric information, such as fingerprints and iris scans and a front-facing photograph at registration centers, once the required systems are fully functional and secure.
Among the major preparatory activities for Step 2 is the deployment of more than 4,000 registration kits to the target provinces.
The Step 3 will involve the issuance of the PhilSys Number (PSN) and the physical ID (PhilID).
“How is it helpful for COVID? We realized that of the 8.7 million that we registered for Step 1, 89% do not have bank accounts because they have no IDs or other requirements,” Chua said.
The NEDA chief said the government is planning to have Land Bank of the Philippines collocate in biometrics registration centers so that bank account opening process can coincide with the national ID data collection procedure.
Chua said the government is eyeing to make all 18 million or 20 million unbanked low-income Filipinos have bank accounts by the end of next year.

A vaccine needs to secure an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for it to be legally administered in the Philippines.
Sinopharm has yet to apply for an EUA before the FDA.
The FDA, however, can allow the use of the vaccine without EUA approval provided that the vaccine secured a compassionate use permit.
The issuance of compassionate use permit, however, does not amount to stamp of approval from the FDA.
Smuggled vaccines
Roque earlier said that the President prefers to be inoculated with a Sinopharm vaccine.
Former broadcaster Mon Tulfo, who has served as the country’s special envoy to China, has revealed that he, some senators and Cabinet members had received their two doses of smuggled Sinopharm vaccine in October 2020 and that Duterte also wanted to have the Sinopharm jab.
Roque could not say if Tulfo’s claims that the President wanted the same vaccine for his family members were true.
Nevertheless, Roque assured the public on Monday that the President will take his COVID-19 vaccine in public view.
“It will be in public, and you will be informed if there will be side effects on the President,” he said.
Roque, however, clarified that the Constitutional provision requiring disclosure of the President’s health condition has limits.
“Ang sinasabi po sa Konstitusyon, iyong kailangang sabihin ay seryosong pagkakasakit lamang,” Roque said.
Presidential Security Group commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III admitted in December 2020 that they got vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine.

Positive results from final stage trials of several vaccine candidates have raised hopes that there is light at the end of the tunnel in the quest to curb a pandemic that has already killed nearly 1.4 million people worldwide.
How many in the pipeline?
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 48 ""candidate vaccines"" at the stage of clinical trials in humans by mid-November, up from 11 in mid-June.
Eleven of them are at the most advanced ""Phase 3"" stage, in which a vaccine's effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally on tens of thousands of people across several continents.

A European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca on Monday said an interim analysis of its phase 3 trials showed their vaccine had an average 70 percent efficacy in trials involved 23,000 people.
The statement said the drug showed a 62 percent efficacy when people were given two full doses, but this rose to 90 percent in those given only a half dose initially followed by a full dose.
It said the vaccine could be stored, transported and handled ""at normal refrigerated conditions"" for at least six months and announced plans to develop up to three billion doses in 2021, if it passes the remaining regulatory hurdles.
The announcement comes after a US-German collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech reported early in November that phase 3 trials for its mRNA vaccine showed 90 percent efficacy in preventing COVID-19 symptoms and did not produce adverse side effects among thousands of volunteers.
It has since announced further trial results showing the vaccine works 95 percent of the time.
""Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics,"" the company said.
Pfizer is currently seeking Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and expects to roll out 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year.
Also this month, US biotech firm Moderna said its vaccine also showed almost 95 percent efficacy.
Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval in the US and around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
The company is on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021, it said.
In addition, several state-run Chinese labs are also thought to have produced among the more promising candidate vaccines.
Russia, meanwhile, has already registered two COVID-19 vaccines, even before clinical trials were completed.
What kind of vaccines?
Some methods for making a vaccine are tried-and-tested, while others remain experimental.
Inactivated traditional vaccines use a virus germ that has been killed, while others use a weakened or ""attenuated"" strain.
These vaccines work when the body treats the deactivated pathogen as if it were a real threat, producing antibodies to kill it without endangering the patient with full infection.
So-called ""sub-unit"" vaccines contain a fragment of the virus or bacteria they are derived from to produce a similar immune response.
""Viral vector"" varieties deliver fragments of viral DNA into cells, often hitching a lift off of other virus molecules.
For example, a measles virus modified with a coronavirus protein—the apparatus SARS-CoV-2 uses to latch on to human cells—can by deployed to provide immunity to COVID-19.
Both Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are based on cutting-edge technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called messenger RNA to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
Safety first
Trials of two candidate vaccines—made by Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly—were ""paused"" recently over safety concerns.
But that is not necessarily bad news, said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
""The fact that trials are paused should indicate that there should be confidence that the whole process of monitoring the safety of trial participants is working well,"" he said.
Recent cases in which recovered COVID patients were infected a second time with a new strain also raise the question of how long vaccines might last.
In October, the US FDA said it would need to see two months of follow-up data after vaccination before giving emergency authorization for any vaccine use. 
""What is different for COVID-19 vaccines is that speed of development and potential approval is much faster due to the public health emergency,"" noted the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
But even that pressing need cannot overcome the rules.
""Before approval, all vaccines in the European Union are evaluated against the same high standards as any other medicine,"" the EMA said in a statement. — AFP",GMA News

The government has initially said it is reserving 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from the COVAX facility to health workers, and that the shipment would arrive by mid-February. This timeline has since been scuttled over changing  reasons for their delayed arrival, ranging from lack of a indemnification law to logistical problems.
Ultimately, 600,000 doses of Sinovac donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines arrived in the country on February 28—the first legal shipment of COVID-19 vaccines to be delivered to the country.
Less than 24 hours after Sinovac’s delivery, the country started its COVID-19 vaccination rollout with health workers getting the first Sinovac jab.
Sinovac secured EUA from the FDA on February 22, but did not recommend its use on health workers since its efficacy rate on this group only reached 50.4%. — BM, GMA News",GMA News

This, despite President Rodrigo Duterte's earlier order to the Presidential Security Group (PSG) to keep silent on the issue.
""The officials so inoculated must reveal all the information that they have on the unregistered vaccines if only to protect our country against forces seeking to influence the highest office in our land to the detriment of our people,"" De Lima said in Senate Resolution 603.
""Withholding of information on this matter during any investigation serves only to protect criminals who smuggled and are probably still smuggling these illegal vaccines into our country,"" she added.
The Senate Committee of the Whole is scheduled to hold a hearing on the government's COVID-19 immunization plan on Monday.

However, Senate President Vicente Sotto III said the PSG would not be invited as he stressed that the inquiry would focus on how the P72.5 billion allocation for vaccines will be used.
Duterte previously said some members of the military were already injected with a COVID-19 vaccine made by Chinese firm Sinopharm without an approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines confirmed that soldiers who are part of the PSG were the first ones who got vaccinated against COVID-19, ""owing to the nature of their mission and function.""
Some Cabinet members also received it, according to Interior Secretary Eduardo Año.
But a group claiming to be the sole distributor of Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines has denied involvement in the covert inoculation.

PANTI,2021-01-04 16:29:00,"Individuals who get inoculated with unregistered COVID-19 vaccines will not be liable under the law unless they buy or promote the use of these vaccines, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said.
Guevarra made the response in light of Senator Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa saying that he will be willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Dela Rosa also rushed to the defense of the Presidential Security Group (PSG), who admitted that they injected themselves with a non-FDA registered COVID-19 vaccine, saying he would do the same because he is in charge of his life.
“Under our existing laws, a person who freely and voluntarily gets himself inoculated with an unregistered or unauthorized drug or vaccine does not incur any criminal liability, unless he himself has caused its unlawful procurement or promotes its use by other people,” Guevarra said.
Contrary to Dela Rosa’s sentiments, the Justice chief said that FDA’s stamp of approval on vaccines is important.

“Although vaccination is a matter of personal survival, it is important that laws on vaccine approval and administration be strictly observed for the benefit of everyone,” Guevarra pointed out.
“Section 11 of the FDA law prohibits the manufacture, importation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, promotion, etc of any health product that is unregistered with the FDA, and Section 12 thereof imposes the penalty of fine and/or imprisonment,” he added.
Likewise, Guevarra said that persons who knowingly or willfully administer an unregistered vaccine may be held liable under the Medical Practice Act of 1959.
Dela Rosa’s words went, ”FDA-approved o hindi, buhay ko ito, wala akong pakialam diyan sa FDA kung i-approve nila o hindi yan basta buhay ko nakasalalay, I have to decide for my own life.”

“We actually don’t agree with it, that it is ‘sayang lang’ or that it is ineffective. In fact, we also agree with the WHO position,” David said.
Earlier, a WHO official maintained that the AstraZeneca vaccine is still effective even in areas with widespread transmission of the South Africa variant, noting that the study showing otherwise only had a “very small sample” of less than 2,000 patients.

Turkish researchers said on Thursday Sinovac's CoronaVac was 91.25% effective based on an interim analysis, only to see a confusing readout the same day from Brazil which said the vaccine's efficacy was between 50% and 90%.
Brazil has also delayed release of its efficacy data on the vaccine three times, as Sinovac seeks to consolidate data from global trials that include Indonesia, Turkey and Chile.
The efficacy data is closely watched as many developing countries have signed deals to use the Sinovac vaccine which is easier to store and transport than rival shots developed by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech and Moderna.
Experts say it's not unusual for a vaccine to show different efficacy rates in various settings, as trial protocols, data size and population could impact results, but the way CoronaVac data has been released created some confusion.

Indonesia, which is also considering the shot for mass inoculation, confused the world earlier this month when state-owned Bio Farma said the vaccine's efficacy was 97%. It later clarified that the prevention rate could not be determined yet and it was necessary to wait for complete data.
""When you are not able to release sufficient details, it's probably better not to make your announcement like that,"" said Paul Griffin, a professor at the University of Queensland who is also running a number of COVID-19 vaccine studies.
With efficacy data in Turkey based on just 1,322 subjects and small infection cases, experts say more data from a larger number of participants would be needed to seek regulatory approval.
""It's difficult to determine how well [the] Sinovac vaccine works based solely on 29 coronavirus cases,"" Kim said.
""It would be good to have more volunteers and more infections, which would boost the robustness of the efficacy data.""
That would make data from Brazil crucial where it has completed a trial with 13,000 volunteers, while studies in Turkey and Indonesia involve more than 7,000 and 1,600 respectively.
Some experts warned greater scrutiny on data compilation and analysis was expected for COVID-19 vaccines developed in China due to its patchy safety track record.
""This should be analyzed very clearly and transparently. And transparency is one of the biggest concerns for China, especially with their vaccine and also because of their track record,"" said Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist at Queensland’s Griffith University.
""So this is one of the very important and crucial times for China to show the world how they have improved the quality of their vaccines... This is something they have to explain to the world, through of course scientific papers."" — Reuters",GMA News

""This is not part of the rollout, this is not part of the procurement of the government. This is just on their (PSG) own initiative so there's no connection or any apprehension about the distribution,"" Año said in an interview on ANC.
Año was reacting to the complaints of some frontline health workers regarding prioritization in connection with COVID-19 vaccines.
""The President has already laid out the guidelines on who are the priorities, the healthcare workers, the vulnerable, the indigent families and then the soldiers,"" he added.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo said they are looking into the vaccination of some soldiers and Cabinet officials against COVID-19 using an unregistered vaccine.

Año, meanwhile, asked the public not to complicate the matter as he maintained that there is nothing illegal about the said vaccination. He also said only a ""handful of soldiers"" received the vaccine.
""Don't complicate things, just as simple as the soldiers protecting the masses would want to be inoculated and they're able to get some donation on it, and the country [that] provided it has an approved EUA (emergency use authorization). It's just simple, let's not complicate things,"" he said.

How long does it really take for a vaccine to be developed?
According to a report on GMA News Digital, it took scientists four years to develop a vaccine for the mumps virus, which is actually the fastest vaccine to have been developed in history.
In 1967, Maurice Hilleman developed the approved  mumps vaccine after four years of development from getting samples, approval, and finally to its licensing.
""Being optimistic, I think we will probably have some vaccine in 18 months from start, so probably sometime mid-next year. So 14 months from that, that would be a very optimistic view,"" said Dr. Lynda Stuart, tth director of vaccine research at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

The development of a vaccine
In developing a vaccine, Stuart said there are two things to consider: speed and volume.
“So I think there are two problems that we face with vaccines for COVID-19. The first is clearly we would all like a vaccine very quickly. And so there is a question of speed. But the second question is a question of volume.” 
Stuart said speed of vaccine development and the volume of mass production must be balanced, since one without the other will not give the world the right solution.
""If we get a vaccine that's very fast, but we only can give it to 10 people that's not going to help us,"" Stuart explained.
""And if we get a vaccine that we can give to millions of people, but it takes us 10 years, that's also not the right solution,"" she added.
Stuart said for the planet to return to normalcy, a COVID-19 vaccine has to be developed.
“How long it will take us to get the first vaccine is very different from how long will it take us to get a vaccine that we can deploy to 7 billion people on the planet,"" Stuart said.
Although vaccine development has been a difficult challenge for science experts, a new technology and the unprecedented global collaboration within the scientific community can help speed up the process.
""The global scientific community has been quite remarkably collaborative... There are probably about 80 or so or between 80 and 100 labs that are beginning to work on this.”
“[To] get to this point would take us a couple of years. So the fact that we're here in a couple of months is, I think the important thing to know,"" she added.
It also helped that the genetic sequence of SARS-COV-2 or the virus that causes COVID-19 has also been released early.
According to the report, knowing the genetic sequence is important for experts to learn the characteristics of the virus including its behavior and weaknesses. This will help them produce vaccines and cure.
How does the vaccine work?
Professor Marilen Parungao who teaches microbiology at the University of the Philippines-Manila and who is also studying vaccinology explained how the vaccines work with an interesting metaphor: A by-invitation-only party, where the virus the gate crashers.
“Imagine there’s a by-invite only party. Those who don’t have an invitation will be stopped by the bouncer from entering. That’s how vaccines work in our body. They stop the gate crashers,"" she said.
“If a foreign body enters your system, your immune system will detect it and say, ‘You don’t belong here.’ Then, it will find a way to protect your body, in case the intruder does something harmful,"" she added.
""Have I seen him before? Have I met him before? What did I do when I met him? That’s how our immune system works.” 
The phases of vaccine development
Parungao said developing a vaccine is no easy and fast work since the experts need to allot time to study it thoroughly.
“It’s not like you can just develop vaccines in a snap. Like, when you wake up, there’s a vaccine already,"" Parungao said.
According to Parungao, development of vaccines goes through different phases before it gets approved and distributed to the public.
The first is the exploratory phase where experts study the virus to be able to devise the correct strategy to defeat it.
“It’s like what they are doing with COVID-19. They are studying its genome to know the characteristics of the virus,"" she said.
The second one is the pre-clinical phase, where laboratories check the effectiveness of the candidate vaccine.
“They will mimic the inner workings of the body and then try to determine the reaction of the cell,"" Parungao explained.
""For example, will this candidate vaccine create a molecule that will say, ‘hey, did you create antibodies or not?’ If that didn’t happen, that means the candidate vaccine is not effective. Next!” she added.
If the candidate vaccine passes the clinical phase, it will then be tested via clinical trial in humans where it will try to determine three things: immunogenicity, efficacy, and most importantly, safety.
“Are you familiar with allergies? When you inhale dust, for instance, and then you sneeze or get itchy, that means your body identifies the dust as a foreign intruder,"" Parungao explained. ""That is an immunogenic candidate. That’s good because your body recognizes it as something foreign.”
Effectiveness is the next thing to be determined or whether or not the candidate vaccine will produce anti-bodies to help beat a virus.
""You just don’t produce anti-bodies, it must help you clear the virus and cure you. That’s what we call efficacy.”
The most important element of vaccine development is safety.
Parungao said even if a candidate is effective but if it is proven unsafe, people can't use it and scientists have to go back to square one.
""This is what slows down the clinical trials. They would be in Phase 1 already of the trial and the candidate vaccine is not safe to use… They have to go back to square one,"" Parungao explained.
After experts declare a candidate vaccine's safety and efficacy, it will still be subjected to regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration or FDA.
Stuart said the experts are looking for ways to fast track it and have already started safety trials.
“The first safety trials I think started in March or April. So that's two or three months, rather than a year. So we're starting them really fast.”
Stuart said they are also starting to build the manufacturing capacity early to avoid a long period of waiting before it can be deliverable.
""And then we are also looking to do what we call at risk manufacturing scale-up. We know that once a vaccine works, we normally then have to build the factory that makes the vaccine,"" Stuart said.
""And so what we are doing is we're really trying to identify the ones that we think have promise and start building the manufacturing capacity early. So that if they work, we're not waiting a long period of time before the vaccine is actually deliverable in the billions of millions of doses.”
How much will it cost to make a vaccine?
According to the American Journal of Public Health, vaccine development costs US$200 million to US$500 million.
This is the reason why big pharmaceutical companies are mostly the ones capable of producing vaccines while independent scientists depend on monetary support from private institutions and the government.
Parungao said the best way to go about it is to fund the research and not offer a reward after producing one.
“Instead of telling people that they will get a reward for finding a vaccine, give them the money to actually start and fund the development process,"" she said.""That would be a better quotation, instead of giving the reward at the end. What is that anyway? A reimbursement?”
“Science is not like that. Science is funded from the basic to the applied,"" she continued.
Should the day come when the world finally has the COVID-19 vaccine, Parungao said there should be a discussion on who gets access to it and reassurance that the poor will also receive them as well.

The vaccine, currently being evaluated by Britain's independent medicines regulator, provides ""100 percent protection"" against severe COVID disease requiring hospitalization, Pascal Soriot said in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
He added he believes trials will show his firm has achieved a vaccine efficacy equal to Pfizer-BioNTech at 95 percent and Moderna at 94.5 percent.
“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,"" the chief executive said, while saying only that data would be published at ""some point.""
The UK government announced on December 23 that the developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had submitted their data to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Approval is expected to be granted permission to roll out the jab on January 4, The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus shot to be authorized for use by the UK's independent medicines regulator and has been given to 600,000 of the country's most vulnerable people since last month.
Earlier trials had shown varying outcomes in the AstraZeneca shot's efficacy. The vaccine initially showed an average 70 percent effectiveness but that level jumped to 90 percent depending on dosage.
'Storm' over data
Behind this average figure from large-scale trials in the UK and Brazil was a 62 percent effectiveness for those who were vaccinated with two full doses of the shot.
For volunteers who received a half-dose first and then a full dose one month later, however, the vaccine was found to have 90 percent efficacy.
Soriot said he was ""surprised"" by the initial findings. ""We would have preferred a simpler set of results,"" he added.
The lack of clarity and transparency over the discrepancy in the results was widely criticized. Soriot said he had not expected the pushback that followed.
""We assumed people would be a bit disappointed, that’s for sure,"" he said. ""But we didn’t expect that storm.""
Great hopes have been placed in the AstraZeneca shot, originally based on a weakened version of a chimpanzee virus, because of its low cost.
AstraZeneca's vaccine also enjoys a logistical advantage over the Pfizer-BioNTech alternative, as it can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of between two and eight degrees Celsius (36-46 Fahrenheit) for at least six months.
That is a far cry from the -70C needed for Pfizer/BioNTech's offering and could allow use of the existing refrigerated supply chain to cut costs.
'Light at the end of the tunnel'
In a vote of confidence for its homegrown vaccine, the bulk of Britain's requirements are expected to be met by the jab.
The government has ordered 100 million doses, with 40 million doses scheduled to be available by the end of March.
UK officials will hope that confidence is rewarded, not least because the country has been one of the countries most affected by the pandemic with more than 70,000 deaths.
A surge in cases has hit nationwide over the past week, falling especially on the southeast of England and blamed on a new strain of the virus believed to be more infectious, which was first identified in the UK.
According to one British study the strain is 50 percent to 74 percent more contagious.
In an effort to contain the spread of the disease, millions across Britain were placed under tougher lockdown restrictions that came into force on 26 December.
Dozens of countries have also imposed travel restrictions on the UK to stop the spread of the new strain.
Writing in the Mail on Sunday newspaper, Finance Minister Rishi Sunak acknowledged it had been ""a tough year for everyone in this country.""
However, he added that ""the early roll-out of vaccines—and the incredible work of our scientists and NHS—means we can now see light at the end of the tunnel.""

PANTI,2020-11-25 12:50:00,"British firm AstraZeneca’s bid to conduct clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines is pushing through in the aftermath of impressive results of its clinical trials in the UK, the Department of Health said Wednesday.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the announcement two days after AstraZeneca announced that its joint COVID-19 vaccine effort with Oxford University showed that it could be as much as 90% effective.
“They first submitted documentary requirements to our Vaccine Experts Panel (VEP) last November 16, that time hindi pa kumpleto. Immediately, by November 18, they were able to complete all the documentary requirements so they are now for evaluation of the VEP and Ethics Review Board and other the rest of regulatory process for the clinical trial in the country,” Vergeire said.
After securing approval from VEP and Ethics Board, AstraZeneca would still have to get a green light from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration before it can proceed on its clinical trials here.
Vergeire earlier said it is best that COVID-19 vaccines manufactured abroad conduct clinical trials here since it would show how safe and effective the vaccine is for the Philippine population which is now a least 110 million.

AstraZeneca-Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine has been found 70% effective against COVID-19 at first half dose, but it increases to 90% after the second full dose is administered.
Likewise, AstraZeneca’s price range is cheaper at $3 to $4 compared with American firms Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech which COVID-19 vaccines proved also over 90% effective cost more due to the requirement of an ultra low freezer storage.
Vergeire, however, deferred comment on the query if AstaZeneca is the best option for the Philippines at this point despite these initial information.
“Kung sa practicality at kung ideal ba sa atin, antayin po natin ang pag-evaluate ng ating mga eksperto,” Vergeire said.
Vergeire said while the Philippines has yet to decide which COVID-19 vaccines to buy, government authorities are in talks with cold storage firms in the event that the country needs it for storing COVID-19 vaccines.
“Storage requirements would depend on logistical requirements of a specific vaccine. Once we have final list of vaccines na ating i-aangkat o ipo-procure, saka natin mafa-finalize ang pangangailangan. But we are preparing, nakikiapagusap na ang ating mga units at saka agencies,” she said.

Moderna could have tens of millions of doses ready when and if the vaccine is deemed safe and effective, Collins told reporters on a call.
The large late-stage trial is designed to evaluate the safety of Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine and determine if it can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses.
Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, said a readout from the trial could come by November, December, or even earlier. Fauci said he was ""not particularly concerned"" about the vaccine's safety after seeing data from earlier, smaller trials.

Trial volunteers will receive two injections about 28 days apart of either 100 micrograms of mRNA-1273 or a placebo.

1. Where can we get a vaccine?
Based on vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief Implementor Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.’s report to President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night, the Philippines is eyeing at least three to four vaccines for use in the Philippines with the earliest coming in the second quarter of next year.
The three vaccines, in order of stages of negotiations, are:
AztraZeneca from the United Kingdom; 
Sinovac from China; and
Pfizer from the US.

  Galvez said through the Food and Drug Administration, a memorandum of understanding can be signed with AstraZeneca as early as end of November, with the company committing at least 20 million doses.
The United Kingdom also gave assurance it will help the Philippines with the rollout of the vaccine by sending its soldiers. Rollout could be simultaneous with that of the United Kingdom. Earliest best case scenario is second quarter of next year.
AztraZeneca has reported up to 90% efficacy against COVID-19, Pfizer at 95%, while Sinovac is being used in China on an emergency basis.
From these three sources alone, Galvez said the Philippines could come up with 60 million vaccines that will be enough to trigger a herd immunity in the Philippines according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
The Philippines is also in talks with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute and US’ Johnson and Johnson.
2. How soon can we get a vaccine? 
As early as second quarter of next year, according to Galvez.
The Philippines is in advance talks with AztraZeneca. A memorandum of understanding could be signed as early as end of November.
3. Who will get the vaccine? 
Galvez said individuals from areas that are highly infected by COVID-19 will be vaccinated first.
He mentioned the National Capital Region, Davao, Cebu, and Bacolod initially.
In these highly infected areas, people from the poorest of the poor under the 4Ps beneficiary list will be vaccinated first, followed by other sectors like healthcare workers, the police and the military.
Duterte emphasized the need to prioritize the military and the police, saying he needs them to be healthy. The police and the military along with barangay officials will help in the rollout of the vaccine.
The government has promised to vaccinate all Filipinos for free.
In previous “Talk to the Nation Addresses,” Galvez said big corporations are also making efforts to secure vaccines for their employees and donate a sizeable chunk to the government.
4. How much will the vaccines cost?
According to Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, the vaccines will cost about P73 billion.
He’s pegging it at $25 dollars per Filipino or at P1,200 per Filipino for 60 million Filipinos.
Vaccinating 60 million Filipinos is enough to trigger herd immunity, according to Duque, which is simply having more people immune to COVID-19 effectively slowing down if not cutting off transmission. —BAP/KG, GMA News",GMA News

According to Dr. Jaime Montoya of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) on Friday, these vaccines are:
Sinovac from China
Janssen
Sputnik V from Russia
Clover Biopharmaceuticals
AstraZeneca
In order for a potential vaccine to conduct clinical trials in the country, it has to secure clearance from a panel of vaccine experts under DOST.
Once it is cleared by the DOST panel, it would also need approval from the Ethics Board and the Food and Drug Administration.

According to FDA Director General and Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo, only Sinovac has been cleared so far by the vaccine expert panel.
“Ito ay ini-evaluate natin ngayon at mukhang kaunting panahon na lang naman siguro at may ibang requirement na lang ang hinihingi natin para ma-approve natin ang clinical trial na 'to,” he said at a public briefing on Thursday.
The Philippines' COVID-19 task force has formed a body that will handle the procurement, supply chain and logistics management, as well as distribution of vaccines especially to priority recipients.
The COVID-19 Vaccine Cluster is under Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the chief implementer of the government's pandemic response.
The government has earmarked P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement under the proposed 2021 national budget.
A recent Social Weather Stations survey shows that 66% of Filipinos are willing to get COVID-19 vaccine if it is available now. 
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the government is eyeing to give COVID-19 vaccine to around 50 million or 50% of the population on an initial basis.
She, however, conceded that the logistical cost of delivering the vaccine across the country could be more expensive than the vaccine itself, especially if the vaccine requires ultra-low freezer storage.  —KBK, GMA News",GMA News

PANTI,2020-12-16 11:02:00,"A COVID-19 vaccine must be 60% to 70% effective to be able to secure approval from the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Director General Eric Domingo of FDA said. 
“Generally, it should be 60% to 70% effective. That is the minimum requirement,” Domingo said in an ANC interview.
“Most vaccines pass [FDA regulation] if they have 60% to 70% efficacy rate. But of course, the higher [percentage of efficacy rate], the better,” Domingo added.
President Rodrigo Duterte has already issued an executive order allowing FDA to issue emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines which it will find safe and effective. 
Only COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca-Oxford have been proven at least 80% effective after human trials.

However, only the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech have secured EUA from regulatory bodies of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. 
With EUA issuance of reputable regulatory bodies limited to Pfizer, Domingo said that it is understandable that the supply is scarce. 
“It takes some time kasi wala pa ring EUA ang iba, so the production is not yet enough to be able to supply it here immediately,” Domingo pointed out. 
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said that COVID-19 vaccine supply from Western companies like American firm Pfizer are only due to arrive in the Philippines by third quarter of 2021. This is because most of the supply were already secured by Western countries like the United States, United Kingdom and European Union. 
Galvez said the Philippines is eyeing to secure 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese firm Sinovac by March 2021.
Sinovac, however, has yet to release the results of the Phase 3 of its clinical trials or the human trials. 
Domingo, however, assured the public that no COVID-19 vaccine will be administered in the country unless it passes FDA scrutiny which includes evaluation of results on human clinical trials. 
“Hindi sila makakapasok unless ito ay safe and effective,” Domingo said.
The Philippines has already secured 2.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca-Oxford—an initiative funded by the private sector for donation to the Philippines government.

Secretary Carlito Galvez, the chairman of the national task force for COVID-19 response, made the remark after President Rodrigo Duterte asked in a briefing when the first vaccine will be given to Filipinos.
“Eighty percent po ang nakuha ng mga malalaking bansa. Ngayon po nakita namin pinaka-earliest [vaccination] is mga March, nine-negotiate po namin sa ambassador ng China,” he said.
The bulk of the vaccines would likely arrive in May, June, and July 2021 if negotiations with manufacturers AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Sinovac prove fruitful, Galvez added.
“Sa first quarter, ito po ang tinatawag nating ‘mini rollout.’ Tama lang sa first quarter po, makita natin ‘yung rollout ng ibang bansa para matuto tayo sa kanilang experience,” he said.
Food and Drug Administration chief Eric Domingo earlier said there was a chance that a COVID-19 vaccine would be rolled out in March next year following positive developments abroad.
The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Singapore have authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use after it showed 95 percent efficacy.
Galvez said this would help speed up the approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the Philippines as well.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier clarified that the Philippines’ talks with Pfizer were still underway after he was accused of “dropping the ball” during negotiations that allegedly led to a delay in the delivery of 10 million doses.
Meanwhile, Galvez said vaccine experts were studying the performance of China’s Sinovac vaccine and Russia’s Sputnik V.
Sinovac was earlier accused of engaging in bribery to hasten the approval of its vaccines.

Solidarity trial
Department of Science and Technology chief Fortunato Dela Peña, also a resource speaker in the same forum, said the recruitment of participants in the World Health Organization (WHO) solidarity trial for COVID-19 vaccines may only start after the WHO releases next month its protocols and specific list of vaccines that will be used.

He reiterated that the participants will be recruited from the top five to 10 barangays with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country.
""This is important because we want to test for efficacy of the vaccine and we will do it in phases where there is a high occurrence or attack rate,"" Dela Peña said.
""If WHO will release the list of vaccines and protocols by October, that is the only time that we can start recruiting patients,"" he added.
The DOST is in the process of finalizing the memorandum of agreement between the DOST and Department of the Interior and Local Government for the conduct and zoning of the clinical trials, according to Dela Peña.
'17 other bilateral partners'
Aside from participating in the WHO Solidarity Trial, the Philippines also entered into bilateral agreements with 17 other COVID-19 vaccine developers from China, US, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Russia, and India.
""We're approaching these countries to find out what is the status of their vaccine and whether they are willing to enter into partnership with us in one form or another either through trials or through manufacture in our country,"" Dela Peña said.
The Philippine government has so far signed confidentiality data agreements (CDA) with six foreign pharmaceutical companies.
Gamaleya Research Institute from Russia and Sinovac from China are both interested to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials and venture into local manufacturing of their products in the Philippines, Dela Peña said.
He added that three others—ZFSW from China, The University of Queensland from Australia, and Adimmue from Chinese Taipei have also signified interest to conduct clinical trials in the country.
Another one from China, Sinopharm, is also interested in supplying their products to the Philippines.
To date, no clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine have started yet in the country, the DOST chief said.
As of September 24, the FDA said it has not received any application yet for Phase 3 clinical trials.
""Wala pang umaabot sa FDA na application for a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine. They are still with the vaccine expert panel. I think they are still completing documents. So officially, wala pang na-e-endorse sa FDA,"" Domingo said. 
On the other hand, the application for a certificate of product registration in the FDA after the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials would take around 45 to 60 days, depending if the vaccine is already pre-qualified by the WHO or FDA counterparts in other countries.

Together with Pfizer Inc's vaccine, also shown to be more than 90% effective, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December with as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available by the year's end.
Next year, the U.S. government could have access to more than 1 billion doses just from the two vaccine makers, more than needed for the country's 330 million residents.
The vaccines, both built using new technology known as messenger RNA or mRNA, represent powerful new tools to fight a pandemic that has infected 54 million people worldwide and killed 1.3 million. The news also comes at time when COVID-19 cases are soaring, hitting new records in the United States and pushing some European countries back into lockdowns.
""We are going to have a vaccine that can stop COVID-19,"" Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in a telephone interview.

Moderna's interim analysis was based on 95 infections among trial participants who received either a placebo or the vaccine. Of those, only five infections occurred in those who received the vaccine, which is administered in two shots 28 days apart.
A key advantage of Moderna's vaccine is that it does not need ultra-cold storage like Pfizer's, making it easier to distribute. Moderna expects it to be stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F) for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20 degrees Celsius.
Pfizer’s vaccine must be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, the sort of temperature typical of an Antarctic winter. At standard refrigerator temperatures, it can be stored for up to five days.
The data from Moderna's 30,000 participant-strong trial also showed the vaccine prevented cases of severe COVID-19, a question that still remains with the Pfizer vaccine. Of the 95 cases in Moderna's trial, 11 were severe and all 11 occurred among volunteers who got the placebo.
Moderna, part of the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed program, expects to produce around 20 million doses of the vaccine for the United States this year, millions of which the company has already made, and is ready to ship if it receives FDA authorization.
""Assuming we get an emergency use authorization, we'll be ready to ship through Warp Speed almost in hours,"" Hoge said. ""So it could start being distributed instantly.""
Data details
The 95 cases of COVID-19 included several key groups who are at increased risk for severe disease, including 15 cases in adults aged 65 and older and 20 in participants from racially diverse groups.
Most side effects were mild to moderate. A significant proportion of volunteers, however, experienced more severe aches and pains after taking the second dose, including about 10% who had fatigue severe enough to interfere with daily activities while another 9% had severe body aches. Most of these complaints were generally short-lived, the company said.
Moderna's data provide further validation of the promising but previously unproven mRNA platform, which turns the human body into a vaccine factory by coaxing cells to make certain virus proteins that the immune system sees as a threat and mounts a response against.
Moderna expects to have enough safety data required for U.S. authorization in the next week or so and the company expects to file for emergency use authorization in the coming weeks.
The United States has the world's highest known number of COVID-19 cases and deaths with more than 11 million infections and nearly 250,000 deaths.
The Trump Administration has primarily relied on development of vaccines and treatments as its response to the pandemic. Moderna has received nearly $1 billion in research and development funding from the U.S. government and has a $1.5 billion deal for 100 million doses. The U.S. government also has an option for another 400 million doses.
The company hopes to have between 500 million and 1 billion doses in 2021, split between its U.S. and international manufacturing sites and dependent in part on demand.
The U.S. government has said COVID-19 vaccines will be provided free to Americans, whether they have health insurance, are uninsured or are covered by government health programs such as Medicare.
Moderna also said it will use its data to seek authorization in Europe and other regions.
Other countries such as China and Russia have already begun vaccinations. Russia licensed its “Sputnik-V” COVID-19 vaccine for domestic use in August before it released data from large-scale trials. It said on Nov. 11 that its vaccine was 92% effective based on 20 infections in its large trial. -Reuters",GMA News

In a press conference, Guevara said the country will have access to the vaccine by the fourth quarter of this year but only for clinical trials.
“If we’re talking about the availability en masse, we believe this is going to happen in the second quarter of next year,” Guevara said.
“But if we're talking about the clinical trials, it will start in the fourth quarter of this year.”
Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of DOST Philippine Council for Health Research Development, said the timeline heading to the availability of the vaccine will depend on the country of the vaccine's developer.
According to him, the timeline will start when the vaccine is already approved by its country of origin. For instance, Montoya said Russia, which claimed to be the first country to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, is planning to start the clinical trial involving other countries in September.
He said the process will take six months to finish, after which the results will be gathered, and then the Food and Drugs Administration in Russia will review them for a month.
When the FDA in Russia approved the vaccine, approval from the FDA in other countries will then be sought.
At the start of the second quarter of 2021, the FDA Philippines will review the vaccine for a month. If the results are good, the FDA will approve the vaccine.
By the end of the second quarter of 2021, the vaccine will be available  for market and use, Montoya said.
Philippines’ representative to the World Health Organization’s Solidarity Trials for COVID-19, Dr. Lina Gloriani, said the Russia-developed vaccine Sputnik V released only limited information.
According to her, the following developers are on the top of the list being considered to be part of the solidarity trial, which are  all currently under Phase 3:
Oxford-AstraZeneca
Sinovac
Sinopharm (two vaccines under development)
Moderna
Pfizer
“Meron pang iba pero nasa Phase 2 pa lang sila. But I think eventually, they will move to Phase 3. So, hindi natin alam sino doon yung isasali sa WHO Solidarity Trial,” Gloriani said.
“Right now, ‘yun po ang nakakausap natin,” she added.
FDA general director Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo explained that the Phase 1, 2, and Phase 3 of vaccine trials test the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
After the Phase 3 trial, Domingo said vaccines can be distributed to market.
Citing information from a meeting with WHO, Domingo earlier said that there were doubts on how Russia jumped to the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Ang huling update natin ay sa Russia mukhang nasa Phase 2 clinical trial pa lamang at patapos pa lamang. Kaya siguro nagulat din ang buong mundo na biglang kine-claim nila na approved na,” he said.
""Hindi natin alam kung ano 'yung approval process na nangyari sa Russia or baka talagang nag-approve na sila after Phase 2 o kung talagang na-complete nila 'yung Phase 3,’ he added.

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/healthandwellness/763865/reuters-journalist-explains-why-he-volunteered-for-covid-19-vaccine-trial/story/,Reuters journalist explains why he volunteered for COVID-19 vaccine trial,STEVE STECKLOW,2020-11-12 16:19:00,"LONDON — So why did I volunteer to be injected with an experimental vaccine for COVID-19? That's what some of my friends wanted to know when I told them what I was doing.
""Who knows about the long term,"" texted a former college roommate. ""Seems like a gamble.""
It all began in July when the British government announced it was seeking lots of volunteers for large-scale clinical trials of new vaccines. Only a month before, a good friend of mine here had died of COVID-19 after spending weeks on a ventilator.
Curious, I completed an online form, figuring I wasn't committing myself to anything.
In late September, an email informed me that I was among more than 250,000 ""pioneers in the fight against COVID-19"" who had enlisted in the cause. On Oct. 1, I was invited to apply for a trial of a vaccine made by an American biotech company called Novavax Inc. It was seeking at the time up to 10,000 volunteers in the United Kingdom for a late-stage trial to determine the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.

""If you are aged 18-84 and in good health, you could be eligible to participate,"" the email stated. ""The study involves six visits over a period of around 13 months. Reasonable travel expenses will be reimbursed.""
Now, it was time to decide. I began researching the Novavax vaccine, which has received less attention than several others. On Monday, Pfizer Inc announced its COVID-19 vaccine candidate appeared to be more than 90% effective. In September, late-stage trials of a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc were halted after a report of a serious neurological illness in a volunteer, although the trials later were permitted to resume.
To me, the Novavax vaccine seemed less risky. Although the Maryland-based company has never received approval for a vaccine, it's employing the same technology to create its COVID-19 candidate that it used with a promising flu shot. I've gotten inoculated against the flu every year for decades and never once had an adverse reaction.
The published results of the first phase of testing the Novavax vaccine also showed no serious side effects among more than 100 participants who were injected with it. The worst case was someone who had a mild fever for a day.
I decided to go for it. I figured if life is ever going to return to normal, the world is going to need vaccines and volunteers to see if they work. On a selfish level, I liked the idea of getting inoculated as soon as possible, given how monotonous—and sometimes scary—my daily routine had become. I've become so risk-averse that my wife has called me her ""jailer.""
Another attraction: If I were to catch the virus, the researchers would carefully monitor me. In the UK, where there has been a surge in new COVID-19 cases to more than 20,000 a day, infected people essentially are on their own unless they require emergency care.
Of course, there was a 50-50 chance I would be injected with a placebo—a saline solution—that wouldn't protect me against anything. In testing vaccines, placebos are used as a control to see whether the real thing is more effective at fending off the virus.
And so, after an online and over-the-phone screening to determine if I had any medical conditions that disqualified me from the study, I was given an appointment for the first of two injections.
I showed up one recent morning at the clinical research facility at King's College Hospital in south London—a small, drab building that is part of a sprawling medical complex. To my surprise, the receptionist asked me to take off my ""Churchill Pro"" bike mask—which costs $33 and uses ""British Military Filtration Technology"" to block ""almost 100%"" of viruses—and replace it with a cheap, disposable one. I later learned this was because my super-duper mask potentially could be contaminated.
Several other volunteers were already in a large room getting set up. I met privately with a doctor who asked if I had any questions. I had a few: ""What if the Novavax vaccine proved so successful that the trial was stopped? Would I be told whether I received the placebo and, if so, be given the real vaccine?"" The doctor told me that if I had gotten the placebo, I would have to wait a year, since the researchers would want to keep monitoring every trial participant. Not what I wanted to hear.
""What if another vaccine is approved first and I was given the placebo? Would I be allowed to take that?"" The doctor suggested that was possible.
After I signed a consent form to participate in the trial, she gave me a brief physical exam. Back in the large room, a nurse gave me a COVID-19 test, sticking a long swab up my throat and then through a nostril. Then he prepared to draw my blood. I warned him my veins were thin and often proved problematic. He proceeded to fail twice before calling over a colleague who had better luck.
The injection itself was uneventful. But when the nurse checked my blood pressure afterward, it had spiked. He asked me to wait a few minutes and basically calm down. I thought about the meditation exercises I had always scoffed at but had recently tried to reduce pandemic-induced anxiety—breathe in, breathe out. It worked.
So far, I've experienced no side effects and am awaiting a second injection once three weeks have passed. Curious about my experience, I spoke to James Galloway, a senior clinical lecturer at King's College who is the doctor responsible for my trial.
He told me that no decisions have been made on what to do with volunteers who received the placebo if Novavax is shown to be effective or another vaccine is approved first. He later added, ""If we get another vaccine that works, we'd want people to get that vaccine if they've had the placebo.""
""We don't want anyone to suffer from participating in the study,"" he said.

According to Leechiu Property Consultants (LPC), a rollout of the vaccine will boost the growth of the industry next year with increased activity in several sectors such as retail.
""We have every confidence that the rollout of the vaccine in 2021 will create unprecedented market euphoria that will dramatically benefit the real estate industry,"" LPC chief executive officer David Leechiu said in a virtual briefing on Tuesday.
""A confluence of factors – from record-low, long-term interest rates, to the country’s fantastic fiscal fundamentals that have resulted in good credit ratings, to newfound mobility and tourism opportunities from a massive injection of infrastructure projects– will ensure that,"" he added.
Earlier this week, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said talks on procurement of the vaccines are ongoing and are being sped up, but contracts are likely to be signed by January 2021.

Data released by LPC showed that the retail sector is already showing signs of increasing activity, as sales have bounced back to 47% - 75% of sales in pre-pandemic times during the third quarter of the year.
This comes even as vacated spaces were recorded at 540,000 square meters in the fourth quarter, with 51% or 277,000 square meters attributable to Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) and 33% or 179,000 square meters from other players struggling to recover from COVID-19 losses.
Still, LPC said rents are holding up owing to the presence of information technology-business process management (IT-BPM) firms and multinationals that would take over PEZA-accredited spaces from POGOs.
""Developments in the last two quarters have created compelling opportunities for IT-BPM players.

Senator Leila De Lima has filed Senate Bill 1942, or the proposed ""Libreng Bakuna Kontra COVID-19 Para sa Lahat ng Pilipino Act,"" which allocates funds and mandates the country's health system to offer vaccines for all Filipinos for free.
“Anticipating the arrival of these vaccines subject to trials and local evaluation soonest, this representation believes the need to guarantee free vaccination for all Filipinos whose right to health should not be diminished by belatedly acting on the health crisis,” De Lima said in a statement in filing the bill.
“As hopes grow for the early arrival of vaccines in the country, we must be prepared and guarantee our people the safe and efficient distribution of the vaccine to all Filipinos, especially the priority and vulnerable sectors of our society. It cannot be overemphasized: vaccine coverage is as important as vaccine efficacy,” she added.
The Philippine government has set aside P73.2 billion for the procurement of a COVID-19 vaccine for 60 million Filipinos, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III earlier said.

He added the finance department estimated the cost of a vaccine to be around $25 or P1,200 per person.
“Ang total niyan is about P73.2 billion financing. That’s pretty much almost fixed… [that] is good for 60 million people to be vaccinated,” Dominguez said.
The vaccination of 60 million would allow for herd immunity, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
A herd immunity will allow a population to be protected from a virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached. Duque said that according to the World Health Organization, herd immunity may be achieved if 60 to 70 percent of the population is vaccinated.
De Lima said that the benefits of a universal vaccination would not only outweigh the costs, as it will be proven cost-effective and efficient in the long run.
“The cost of universal vaccination may seem too high on its face, but could later on be the very tool that will help the government to save more money in order to create and institutionalize more programs for the welfare of all,"" she said.
Aside from the free vaccine provision, the measure would allow persons to choose which accredited COVID vaccine they will get and the institutions from which to receive them.
Vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief Implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier reported that the Philippines is eyeing at least three to four vaccines for use in the Philippines with the earliest coming in the second quarter of next year.
The three vaccines, in order of stages of negotiations, are AztraZeneca from the United Kingdom, Sinovac from China, Pfizer from the US.
The measure also mandates the creation of a database to track vaccination receipts if ever there will be a problem in administering them. —LBG, GMA News",GMA News

The chief executive also said he prefers that the country use medicine to kill the virus and get the vaccine later on.
Duterte's belief that a vaccine against the virus is coming soon has become a familiar refrain during these meetings, with the president citing reported successes of Chinese researchers.
In his address last June 23, Duterte even claimed several countries have already “perfected” vaccines for COVID-19.

""We plan to go into children as soon as we possibly can, but very carefully in terms of safety,"" J&J's Dr. Jerry Sadoff told a virtual meeting of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Friday.
Depending on safety and other factors, the company plans to test in even younger children afterwards, said Sadoff, a vaccine research scientist at J&J's Janssen unit, without giving a timeline.
J&J said in a statement that it is currently in discussions with regulators and partners regarding the inclusion of the pediatric population in its trials.
The US Food and Drug Administration has said it is important for drugmakers to test their vaccines in children. Some doctors have raised concerns that the vaccines themselves could trigger a rare, life-threatening condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in some children.

Rival drugmaker Pfizer Inc has already begun testing the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany's BioNTech in children as young as 12. Their vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA), a new technology that has yet to produce an approved vaccine. J&J's uses a cold virus to deliver coronavirus genetic material in order to spur an immune response. The platform - called AdVac - is used in a vaccine for Ebola that was approved in Europe earlier this year and used on more than 100,000 people, including infants, children, and pregnant women.
The technology's history of safety should be important to regulators, said Dr. Paul Spearman, director of the infectious diseases division of Cincinnati Children's Hospital.
""Most of the toxicities are going to come from the platform and not from putting a different insert into the platform, Spearman said. So replacing the Ebola genetic material with that of the novel coronavirus ""is unlikely to give you major issues,"" he added.

In a statement, Villanueva, who chairs the Senate committee on labor, warned against discriminating workers who decide not to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
“A worker can be late for work and be penalized with salary deduction. But a government guilty of vaccine tardiness faces no such reprimand, even if it causes the nation P2.8 billion in economic losses daily,” Villanueva said.
“A worker who is not yet immune from the virus shouldn't lose his immunity from being fired arbitrarily,"" he added.
The senator said that instead of forcing workers to get a vaccine and threatening their employment, employers should be carrying out confidence building efforts in their company.

“The biggest challenge at the moment for the labor-employer-government tripartite is not just to give more workers better vaccines but also to increase vaccine confidence,” Villanueva said.
""Sa pagbabakuna, the best pa rin po ang 'Sana All.' We cannot have a workforce divided between the ‘Jabbed’ and the ‘Jabbed Nots,'"" he added.
Several groups have opposed the supposed plan of some companies to impose a ""no vaccine, no work"" policy.
Some workers have reportedly approached the Associated Labor Union as early as last year expressing their concern over a warning by employers that their company will implement a ""no vaccine, no work"" policy.
Villanueva said workers should not be faulted for refusing to be vaccinated if they still have concerns on the vaccine to be used on them.
The challenge for the government now is to increase the public's level of confidence on the vaccines, he added.
""There has to be a concerted effort to bring up the degree of trust on vaccines because the restoration of jobs lost in the pandemic, and to a larger extent, our economic recovery, depend on the success of the vaccination program,” Villanueva said.
“If it is a brand even doctors are rejecting, you can understand where the hesitancy is coming from,” he added.
Villanueva earlier called on the government to have workers vaccinated as soon as possible, saying that the economy can only recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic if workers are protected against the disease.

There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments against the coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19, which has infected more than 175,000 people across the world since it was first identified in central China in late December.
It has claimed 7,000 deaths, according to an AFP tally, most in China followed by Italy.
""Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,"" said Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the NIH, using the technical name for the virus that is believed to have originated in bats.
""This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.""
The Seattle trial will study the impact of different doses delivered by intramuscular injection in the upper arm, with participants monitored for side-effects like soreness or fever.
Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving them a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry.
The Moderna candidate vaccine carries the genetic information of this spike in a substance called ""messenger RNA.""
Injecting human tissue with the spike's messenger RNA makes it grow inside the body, thereby eliciting an immune response without having actually infected a person with the full-blown virus.
Global race
Pharmaceuticals and research labs around the world are racing to develop both treatments and vaccines to the new coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment called remdesivir, made by US-based Gilead Sciences, is already in the final stages of clinical trials in Asia and doctors in China have reported it has proven effective in fighting the disease.
But only randomized trials allow scientists to know for sure whether it really helps or whether patients would have recovered without it.
Another US pharma called Inovio, which is creating a DNA-based vaccine, has said it will enter clinical trials next month.
Regeneron is trying to isolate coronavirus-fighting antibodies that can be administered intravenously to confer temporary immunity, and hopes to start human trials by summer.
According to the World Health Organization, 80 percent of COVID-19 cases are mild, 14 percent are severe and about five percent result are critical, resulting in severe respiratory illness that causes the lungs to fill with fluid which in turn prevents oxygen from reaching organs.

This was clarified by Health Undersecretary Mario Rosario Vergeire during an interview on state-run PTV’s Laging Handa briefing on Saturday. 
“Hindi naman po ‘yan ibibigay kung sakaling hindi papasa sa regulatory process natin,” Vergeire said.
The Health official said the supply deal secured by the private sector is an “advanced commitment para lang makasigurado na meron tayong allocation na ganito kadami.”
On Friday, Philippine government, the private sector, and AstraZeneca signed a tripartite agreement for the country to secure a supply of 2.6 million doses of the pharmaceutical firm’s potential COVID-19 vaccine.

This supply, to be paid for by the private sector, will inoculate over one million Filipinos as the British drugmaker's vaccine requires two doses.
AstraZeneca-Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine has been found 70% effective against COVID-19 at first dose, but it increases to 90% after the second dose was administered a month after the first dose.
Vegeire said AstraZenaca’s vaccine will still undergo regulatory processes in the country to be cleared for market release by the Food and Drug Administration.

Marcos, in a CNN Philippines interview, noted that the P54 billion budget that the Senate earmarked for purchasing of vaccines was provided under the unprogrammed funds of the proposed P4.5 trillion national budget for 2021. This means the budget items will only be funded if the government is able to raise enough resources. 
“Ako, deskumpiyado ako sa P54 billion kasi under unprogramemd fund. Kapag unprogrammed, ala tsamba ‘yun eh, depende kung makakakolekta ang gobyerno ng maraming buwis,” Marcos said.

The Senate and the House of Representatives will still reconcile the differing provisions of their versions of the proposed P4.5 trillion budget for 2021 before a Bicameral Conference Committee.

PANTI,2020-11-30 12:35:00,"The Philippines should prioritize giving the COVID-19 vaccine in most of the economic epicenter first before moving on to other hotspots, health expert Dr. Anthony ""Tony"" Leachon said on Monday.
Leachon, former adviser to the National Task Force Against COVID-19, said the National Capital Region or Metro Manila, Calabarzon and Central Luzon form 70% of the country's economic epicenter. 
“They said we can vaccinate in three to five years. I have a different suggestion. The initial volume of vaccines from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna should be focused on NCR which has a population of 13 million, Calabarzon and Central Luzon because these areas make up 70% of the economic epicenter of the country,” Leachon said in an ANC interview.
“Once we are okay with the 70% of our economic epicenter, then we should focus on other hotspots [of COVID-19] like Davao and Cebu,” Leachon added.
Doing so would enable the government to achieve its target in two years instead of five, he said.

Leachon was referring to the timeline given by vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. that 100 million Filipinos will be given a COVID-19 vaccine in five years or 20 million Filipinos annually. 
Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire deferred commenting on Galvez’s timeline since the country has no COVID-19 vaccines yet approved by Philippine regulators. The government and the private sector recently inked a a deal with British firm AstraZeneca for an initial 2.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.
Vergeire said the Department of Health's best performance in mass vaccination came in 1998 when it was able to vaccinate the targeted 85% of the 22.9 million children needing immunization.
However, she conceded that the DOH will not be able to vaccinate 70% of Filipinos within a year mainly due to lack of COVID-19 vaccine supply. 
For Leachon, though, a two-year timeline for vaccination will work if those residing in 70% of the economic epicenter will be prioritized.
“If we want to spread the vaccine thinly, surely it will take us three to five years. But if we want to be agile, we can finish in two years if we focus on the economic epicenter first. Economic recovery would need herd immunity, and the vaccination of 70% in these areas will enable them to return to normalcy and cause faster economic recovery,” Leachon said.
Only COVID-19 vaccines from American firms Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, as well as British firm AstraZeneca in a joint effort with Oxford University, have been proven to be over 90% effective after human trials. 
Vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, however, cost more. They also pose logistical challenges to low and middle income countries since they require ultra low freezer or -70 degrees to -80 degrees Celsius temperature for storage.
Galvez Jr. said last week that more than 35 million Filipinos will be prioritized to receive vaccines against COVID-19.
He said the priority list of vaccine recipients came from the DOH and was created with the guidance of President Rodrigo Duterte.
As a strategy, the vaccination will start in areas that are most affected by the pandemic as well as those considered as business centers so the country will immediately feel its effect, Galvez said.
Areas Galvez identified include the NCR, Calabarzon, Central Luzon, Cebu, Davao, and Cagayan de Oro.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said authorities were also negotiating with AstraZeneca a possible purchase of a further 1 million doses of the vaccine.
During the signing of the tripartite agreement between the Philippine government, the private sector, and AstraZeneca, Galvez called the initiative a significant development because it provides equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine, backed by reputable institutions and AstraZeneca’s provision scheme is not for profit.
“They did this with Oxford University and is backed by the British government. We have confidence in the vaccine made by AstraZeneca. We are seeing light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.

AstraZeneca-Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine has been found 70% effective against COVID-19 at first dose, but it increases to 90% after the second dose is administered a month after the first dose.
Likewise, AstraZeneca’s price range is cheaper at $3 to $4 compared with American firms Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech which COVID-19 vaccines proved also over 90% effective costing more due to the requirement of an ultra low freezer storage.
AstraZeneca, however, has admitted that the initial results of its COVID-19 candidate vaccine still needs to be evaluated following concerns raised by experts that it had to reduce its first dose to half since administering two doses in full only resulted in 62% efficacy.
Likewise, AstraZeneca's human trials in the United Kingdom did not include participants aged 56 years old and above, considered a vulnerable sector of the population alongside health workers.
But for Concepcion, presidential adviser for entrepreneurship, such initial concerns are part of the process and does not change the credibility of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine.
“The concerns [on AstraZeneca]  are part of the process in development of vaccines, and they were able to show good results. It is worth the risk to put the bet on this and I think they will come through,” he said.

Dr. Jaime Montoya of the Philippine Council for Health Research said China's Clover Biopharma was cleared by the VEP last November 20, making it the second Chinese firm to do so after Sinovac.
“The candidate vaccine already passed the VEP review and it is already under review by the Ethics Board,” Montoya said in an online forum.
“Iyong sa Ethics Board, ang alam ko minor information na lang ang hinahanap pa nila. Kaya puwede na magsimula ang clinical trial at the earliest by late December or early January,” he added.
After hurdling the VEP and the Ethics Board, firms with candidate COVID-19 vaccines would still have to get the approval of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can proceed with the clinical trials in the country.

Sinovac was cleared by the VEP last October 15.

The initial results are only the second to be published from a late-stage human trial in the global effort to produce vaccines that could halt a pandemic that has killed more than 1.2 million people and ravaged the world economy.
Russia registered its COVID-19 vaccine for public use in August, the first country to do so, though the approval came before the start of the large-scale trial in September.
""We are showing, based on the data, that we have a very effective vaccine,"" said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev, adding that it was the sort of news that the vaccine's developers would talk about one day with their grandchildren.
The interim results are based on data from the first 16,000 trial participants to receive both shots of the two-dose vaccine, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which has been backing the vaccine and marketing it globally, said.

The interim analysis was conducted after 20 participants in the trial developed COVID-19 and examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo.
That is significantly lower than the 94 infections in the trial of a vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech. To confirm the efficacy rate, Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases.
The Russian trial will continue for six more months, RDIF said in a statement, and data from the trial will also be published in a leading international medical journal following a peer review.
Sputnik V 
The so-called Phase III trial of the shot developed by the Gamaleya Institute is taking place in 29 clinics across Moscow and will involve 40,000 volunteers in total, with a quarter receiving a placebo shot.
The chances of contracting COVID-19 were 92% lower among people vaccinated with Sputnik V than those who received the placebo, the RDIF said.
That's well above the 50% effectiveness threshold for COVID-19 vaccines set by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Russia's announcement follows swiftly on from results posted on Monday by Pfizer and BioNTech, who said their shot was also more than 90% effective.
The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles.
The Sputnik V vaccine is designed to trigger a response from two shots administered 21 days apart each based on different viral vectors that normally cause the common cold: human adenoviruses Ad5 and Ad26.
The drug is named Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race, a nod to the project's geopolitical importance for Putin.
Russia is also testing a different vaccine, produced by the Vector Institute in Siberia, and is on the cusp of registering a third, Putin said on Tuesday, adding that all of the country's vaccines were effective.
""Studies have already shown and confirmed that, firstly, these vaccines are safe and have no serious side effects after use, and secondly, they are all effective,"" the RIA news agency quoted Putin as saying.
RDIF said no serious side effects had been reported during the Sputnik V Phase III trial so far.
Mass vaccinations
Successful vaccines are seen as a crucial to restoring daily life around the world by helping end the health crisis that shuttered businesses and put millions out of work.
Russia registered the vaccine for domestic use in August, prior to the start of the large-scale trial, and has also inoculated 10,000 people considered at high risk of COVID-19 outside of the trial
Putin has said that Russia expects to start mass vaccinations by the end of the year.
""The publication of the interim results of the post-registration clinical trials that convincingly demonstrate Sputnik V vaccine’s efficacy gives way to mass vaccination in Russia against COVID-19 in the coming weeks,"" Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute, said.
Moscow is rolling out a large network of vaccination rooms and residents who want the shot may be able to get it as early as next month if large volumes of doses are supplied by then, Deputy Mayor Anastasia Rakova said on Oct. 30.
However, production challenges remain. Earlier estimates that Russia could produce 30 million doses of the vaccine this year have since been scaled down.
Moscow aims to produce 800,000 doses this month, industry minister Denis Manturov has said, followed by 1.5 million in December. But significantly higher volumes of output per month are expected from early 2021.
Manturov cited issues with scaling up production from small to large-volume bioreactors, while Putin last month cited issues with the availability of equipment.
Officials have said that domestic production of the vaccine will be used first to meet Russia's needs.
RDIF, however, has also struck several international supply deals, amounting to 270 million doses in total.
It is expected that these will in large part be produced in other countries and RDIF has previously announced a deal to manufacture 300 million doses in India and an undisclosed amount of doses in Brazil, China and South Korea.
Trials of the vaccine have also begun in Belarus, and are on track to begin soon in the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and India.
Russia reported 19,851 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours and a record high of 432 deaths. At 1,836,960, its overall case tally is the fifth largest in the world, behind the United States, India, Brazil and France.

As some companies close in on unveiling their initial findings — with Canadian and European regulators already reviewing early data on some vaccines — the following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over a million lives:
Who is furthest along?
US drugmaker Pfizer Inc with German partner BioNTech SE, US biotech Moderna Inc and Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc in conjunction with University of Oxford researchers could provide early analyses of data from their various large trials over the next two months. Johnson & Johnson is not far behind.
What happens in these trials?
The companies are testing their vaccines against a placebo — typically saline solution — in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of COVID-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot.
Neither trial participants nor researchers know who has received the vaccine or placebo until the data is ready for review, or unblinded. The studies rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with COVID-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where the trials are being conducted.
In areas with large outbreaks and community spread, infections will pile up faster.
How will we know if the vaccine works?
The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the World Health Organization have all set similar minimum standards for effectiveness. Vaccines must demonstrate at least 50% efficacy — meaning at least twice as many infections among volunteers who got a placebo than in the vaccine group. Independent panels oversee the trials to monitor for safety and effectiveness since the data is hidden from companies and researchers. These data safety monitoring boards take a peek at the interim results at pre-determined milestones, such as after a certain number of people have become infected. It the vaccine is looking significantly better than the placebo, the companies can apply for emergency use, and the study may be halted or continue to its intended conclusion. A trial also can be halted if the panel determines the vaccine to be unsafe.
Will regulators ensure a vaccine is safe before making it available to the public?
The US Food and Drug Administration has said it will not approve a vaccine unless it is both effective and safe. On Tuesday, it added more stringent safety guidelines for US vaccines. The FDA wants developers to follow trial subjects for at least two months after they receive their final vaccine dose to check for any side effects that may crop up. The agency will consider an emergency use authorization (EUA) once that data is collected from at least half of the trial's participants. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will review the vaccines for the UK and the European Medicines Agency will review vaccines for European Union use.
When will regulators decide?
Regulators will review the vaccines after the companies have enough data to submit applications seeking an EUA or formal approval. Pfizer/BioNtech will likely know how well its vaccine works as soon as this month, while Moderna’s first look at data is more likely to come next month. AstraZeneca could provide a look at late-stage data in the next two months. Regulators for Europe and Canada are considering data on a rolling basis, as it becomes available. The UK and the US both expect speedy reviews of initial data for possible emergency use before more traditional lengthy reviews for formal commercial approvals.
Could these be the first approved coronavirus vaccines?
Yes, although China and Russia are on a similar timeline.
China launched an emergency use program in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people. At least four vaccines are far along including from China National Biotec Group (CNBG), CanSino Biologics and Sinovac. Sinovac and CNBG have said to expect early trial data as soon as November.
Russia’s Gamaleya Institute has begun a 40,000-person late-stage trial and is expected to have early data at the end of October or early November. Russia has also given the vaccine to at least hundreds of “high-risk” members of the general population.
Is US authorization up to President Trump?
The FDA must make sure that the benefits of a vaccine outweigh the risks before authorization since they are intended to be given to hundreds of millions of healthy people. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the authority to override the FDA's recommendation. US President Donald Trump has complained about the new safety guidelines that would likely delay any vaccine availability until after the Nov. 3 presidential election. The Trump administration can hire and fire HHS officials, opening the possibility of political pressure to approve a vaccine. —Reuters",GMA News

The preliminary findings, which have not undergone rigorous review by other scientists, appeared on the preprint server bioRxiv on Thursday.
British drugmaker AstraZeneca last month announced it had teamed up with researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute, which are developing the vaccine.
According to the report, some of the monkeys given a single shot of the vaccine developed antibodies against the virus within 14 days, and all developed protective antibodies within 28 days, before being exposed to high doses of the virus.
After exposure, the vaccine appeared to prevent damage to the lungs and kept the virus from making copies of itself there, but the virus was still actively replicating in the nose.

Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the monkey data were “very definitely” good news.
“It is one of the hurdles to be passed by the Oxford vaccine and it has cleared it well,” he said in an emailed comment.
Although success in monkeys is seen as a key step, many vaccines that protect monkeys in the lab ultimately fail to protect humans.
Evans said one key finding was particularly reassuring – that there was no evidence of immune-enhanced disease, in which instead of protecting against a virus, a vaccine actually makes the disease worse.
“This was a definite theoretical concern for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and finding no evidence for it in this study is very encouraging,” he said.
Last month, British researchers started dosing human volunteers with the vaccine in a small safety trial, making it one of only a handful to have reached that milestone. As of May 13, 1,000 people have received the vaccine, the researchers said.
Other vaccines in human trials include those by Moderna Inc , Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE and China's CanSino Biologics Inc.
Globally, there are more than 100 experimental vaccines under development to fight the new coronavirus that has so far infected 4.39 million people and killed 296,847.
A vaccine that protects people from the coronavirus could end the pandemic, but finding one that works and manufacturing enough doses is a huge challenge.
Normally, it can take up to 10 years to develop a working vaccine, but the urgency of the pandemic has resulted in accelerated timelines, and some officials estimate a working vaccine could be available for emergency use as early as this fall. -- Reuters",GMA News

""This vaccine's efficacy and safety confirm that it will be highly effective against Covid-19 and will have an immediate impact on this public health emergency,"" AstraZeneca chief executive Pascal Soriot said in a statement.
The results ranged between 62 and 90% efficacy depending on the vaccine dosage.
The 70-percent average is lower compared with the efficacy of coronavirus vaccines trialed by rivals Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna which have come in above 90%.
Monday's statement said ""positive high-level results from an interim analysis of clinical trials of AZD1222 in the UK and Brazil showed the vaccine was highly effective in preventing COVID-19... and no hospitalizations or severe cases of the disease were reported in participants.""

The pair said that regimen n=8,895 showed 62 percent efficacy when given as two full doses at least one month apart.
""The combined analysis from both dosing regimens (n=11,636) resulted in an average efficacy of 70 percent.""
AstraZeneca said it would ""immediately prepare regulatory submission of the data to authorities around the world that have a framework in place for conditional or early approval.""
It added that it would seek emergency-use listing from the World Health Organization to accelerate vaccine availability in low-income countries.
AstraZeneca said it is looking at a capacity of up to three billion doses of the vaccine in 2021 pending regulatory approval.
It said the vaccine can be stored, transported and handled ""at normal refrigerated conditions"" of between two and eight degrees Celsius (36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least six months.

He even expressed willingness to get the first shot of the Russian-developed Sputnik V vaccine.
Sputnik V trial results
While many are pinning their hopes on this Russian vaccine, the local experts underscored that the results of its Phases 1 and 2 trials were not even published yet.
""Hindi pa po natin nakikita ang Phase 1 and Phase 2 results of this. It has to be published in the scientific world so that everybody can look into its safety, tolerability as well as the effectiveness,"" Dr. Josefina Carlos, an infectious disease specialist and a vaccine clinical trialist, said.

In a non-commissioned poll conducted from September 17 to 20, the SWS asked 1,249 adult Filipinos whether they think a vaccine and medicine to treat COVID-19 will become available in the next 12 months.
80 percent of the respondents said they expect a vaccine to be rolled out in the next 12 months while 17 percent said they do not see it happening soon.
Similarly, 80 percent of those surveyed said a medicine to treat COVID-19 will likely become available in the next 12 months while 17 percent said they do not expect it to happen.
The proportion of Filipinos who expect a vaccine and treatment for COVID-19 to be out by next year was highest in Metro Manila at 85 percent, followed by Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
The expectations for the roll out of a COVID-19 vaccine and medicine are also significantly higher among more educated groups.
Eighty-one percent each of college graduates and high school graduates see a COVID-19 vaccine soon, compared to only 68 percent of non-elementary graduates.
Eighty-two percent of college graduates and 80 percent each of elementary and high school graduates expect a treatment for COVID-19 by next year, while only 70 percent expected the same among non-elementary graduates.
The expectations for a COVID-19 vaccine and medicine by 2021 were also higher among those aged 18 to 44 compared to those 45 years old and above.
Expectations did not vary significantly between men and women.

The SWS said its poll questions were patterned after an April-May survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in the United States.
The US poll found that 73 percent of Americans expect a COVID-19 vaccine in 2021, 26 percent do not see it happening, and 3 percent said it will definitely not happen.

“This is fresh information, I just got informed before the opening of the interview [today],” dela Peña said during a Foreign Correspondents of the Philippines (FOCAP) forum.
“The available information passed on to me do not have the full details [yet], but Vaxine has expressed interest in conducting clinical trial and manufacturing [of a vaccine against COVID-19] in the Philippines,” dela Peña added.
Based on the COVID-19 vaccine tracker of The New York Times, Vaxine “developed a vaccine that combines viral proteins with an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system” and its Phase 1 clinical trial began in the middle of this year.
Earlier, the Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP) under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) had cleared Chinese biopharmaceutical company Sinovac's vaccine for COVID-19 clinical trials in the Philippines.

""A vaccine that has 90 percent efficacy and is pretty safe, that is a historic breakthrough,"" the head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), Thomas Cueni, said.
American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.
""This was the best science news of the year,"" IFPMA's director general told AFP in an interview.
Hopes are also high that one or several of the vaccines under development will also help rein in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 1.3 million people out of the over 51.5 million infected.
There are currently more than 40 candidate vaccines against COVID-19 being tested on humans, with a handful in the most advanced Phase 3 trials.
Cueni acknowledged that more data was needed on the Pfizer and BioNTech candidate, which is based on an innovative technology that has never been approved for use before.
The companies based their announcement on interim results from the last step in their clinical trial before officially applying for approval.
'Reason for optimism'
Cueni voiced confidence that any major safety concerns with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would have been known.
""We still need to see the [full] efficacy and the safety data,"" Cueni said, but stressed: ""There is now genuine reason for optimism that these vaccines are basically considered safe.""
He said there is still a long list of unknowns about the vaccine's protection, including whether it will be equally effective in all age groups and how long the protection might last.
Another pressing question is whether it will not only protect a person from COVID-19 infection but also prevent that person from transmitting the virus.
But Cueni said the data so far indicated the vaccine candidate was far more effective in preventing COVID-19 infections than the 50-percent efficacy threshold required by some regulators before considering authorisation.
This was ""big news,"" he said, particularly ""since I think there is reason to hope it won't be the only one.""
""We will see more good results.""
Cueni said safety and efficacy data on at least four other vaccine candidates, being developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, would be known within the next few months.
Vaccine hesitancy
He was optimistic that enough data would soon be available to win approval for using one or more of the COVID-19 vaccines.
And the large developers had already scaled up their manufacturing capacities, and were each in a position to produce upwards of a billion doses next year, he said.
But Cueni acknowledged there were numerous logistical challenges to actually inoculating the huge numbers of people it would take to bring the pandemic to a halt.
And he voiced concern about high levels of vaccine hesitancy in many countries.
Pharmaceutical companies were taking that challenge particularly seriously, he said, insisting they were going ""way above and beyond the normal regulatory requirements"" in terms transparency and data-sharing from trials.
The industry understood the importance of ensuring any authorized vaccine is trusted, he said.

However, experts said the trials were too small to prove safety and effectiveness.
Russia announced last month that its vaccine, named ""Sputnik V"" after the Soviet-era satellite that was the first launched into space in 1957, had already received approval.
This raised concerns among Western scientists over a lack of safety data, with some warning that moving too quickly on a vaccine could be dangerous.
Russia denounced criticism as an attempt to undermine Moscow's research.

In the Lancet study, Russian researchers reported on two small trials, each involving 38 healthy adults aged between 18 and 60, who were given a two-part immunisation. 
Each participant was given a dose of the first part of the vaccine and then given a booster with the second part 21 days later.
They were monitored over 42 days and all developed antibodies within the first three weeks.  
The report said the data showed that the vaccine was ""safe, well tolerated, and does not cause serious adverse events in healthy adult volunteers"".
The trials were open label and not randomised, meaning there was no placebo and the participants knew they were receiving the vaccine and were not randomly assigned to different treatment groups.  
Researchers underlined that larger and longer trials -- including a placebo comparison -- would be needed to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for preventing Covid-19 infection.
The report said the 76 participants of these trials would be monitored up to 180 days, adding that a more rigorous phase 3 clinical trial was planned with the involvement of 40,000 volunteers ""from different age and risk groups"".
- 'Safety is paramount' -
Naor Bar-Zeev of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study, said the research was ""encouraging but small"", adding that it did not give any data on effectiveness among older age groups, who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.
""Showing safety will be crucial with Covid-19 vaccines, not only for vaccine acceptance but also for trust in vaccination broadly,"" he said in a commentary in the Lancet. 
""Since vaccines are given to healthy people and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially to everyone after approval following phase 3 trials, safety is paramount.""
The pandemic has seen an unprecedented mobilisation of funding and research to rush through a vaccine that can protect billions of people worldwide.
This week the US urged states to get ready for a potential Covid-19 vaccine rollout two days before the presidential election in November, sparking concerns President Donald Trump's administration is accelerating research to fit a political timetable.
Russia has said that industrial production of its version is expected from September.
President Vladimir Putin said in early August that the vaccine gave ""sustainable immunity"" and that one of his own daughters had been inoculated, even though Russia's health ministry said clinical trials were not yet complete.
The World Health Organization has urged Russia to follow established guidelines and go ""through all the stages"" necessary to develop a safe vaccine.

Health Undersecretary Carol Taiño previously said the warehousing allocation under the 2021 budget was not intended specifically for the COVID-19 vaccine.
However, the DOH previously said that it is eyeing to establish cold storage facilities in every province in the country to ensure the effectiveness of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, Up to 100 million COVID-19 vaccine doses could be made available in poorer countries under a deal with SII.
So far, the Food and Drugs Administration said that manufacturers of at least five potential COVID-19 vaccine products have expressed interest in conducting clinical trials in the Philippines. — DVM, GMA News",GMA News

""The world is in a race to find a safe and effective vaccine. When the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor withheld. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy,"" Duterte said in a recorded statement at the UN General Assembly's General Debate, which began late Tuesday night Philippine time.
""The COVID-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good. Let us be clear on this,"" he added.
Calling the pandemic ""the biggest test the world and the United Nations has faced since World War II,"" Duterte said that the world needs coordinated plans and efforts to combat it.
""COVID-19 knows no border, it knows no nationality, it knows no race. It knows no gender, it knows no age, it knows no creed,"" he said.

In July, the Philippines joined COVAX (COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access), the part of the World Health Organization's Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator that focuses on ensuring everyone a fair and equitable access to a vaccine. Its initial aim is to deliver two billion doses of safe and effective vaccines to all participating countries by the end of 2021.
Duterte also lauded a UN fund aimed at helping low- and middle-income countries respond to the pandemic.
""As a middle-income country whose economic advances have been derailed by the pandemic, we welcome the launch of the UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. Ensuring universal access to anti-COVID-19 technologies and products is pivotal in the global pandemic recovery,"" he said.
Duterte praised the health workers on the front lines of the war against the virus.
""We salute all frontliners who put their lives on the line even in countries not their own. So also do we honor and recognize the healthcare professionals who selflessly answered the call to combat the COVID-19 pandemic despite its virulence and unknown characteristics,"" he said, adding that the Philippines has some of the world's best health workers.
Despite these words from the President, the Philippines' nurses have the lowest salaries in Southeast Asia, according to a recent study.
The Philippines also ranked low—66th out of 91 countries—in COVID-19 suppression, as rated by leading international medical journal The Lancet, partly due to Duterte's  “medical populism,” it said.
Duterte was among 180 world leaders speaking at the UN event on the occasion of the global body's 75th anniversary.

Sanofi, which is hosting a virtual research and development event, and GSK had said in April the vaccine, if successful, would be available in the second half of 2021.
""We are being guided by our dialogue with regulatory authorities,"" Sanofi research chief John Reed told reporters, when asked about the accelerated time frame.
There are currently no vaccines to prevent the coronavirus that has infected more than 9 million people and killed over 469,000 globally, and only a couple of medicines that have demonstrated benefit in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in clinical trials.
Many drugmakers are racing to come up with a safe and effective vaccine that can be produced at large scale.

Moderna Inc, the University of Oxford in collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc, and an alliance of BioNTech and Pfizer Inc grabbed headlines by moving to human trials as early as March.
Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson said the firsts in the race now were not assured of securing victory.
""There are companies moving faster, but let us be brutally clear, speed has three downsides,"" he said of competition.
""They are using existing work, in many cases done for SARS; it is likely not to be as efficacious; and there is no guarantee on supply in large volumes,"" Hudson said.
The probability of success for Sanofi is ""higher than anybody else,"" the CEO said.

  The comments echoed those of GSK, whose chief medical officer for vaccines told Reuters on Friday the company was aiming at quality before speed.
Sanofi, whose Pasteur vaccines division has a long established reputation, notably in flu, is currently working on two vaccine projects.
One uses an adjuvant made by GSK to potentially boost its efficacy. It has received financial support from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).
The other, being developed with US company Translate Bio Inc, relies on a different technology known as mRNA, similar to the Moderna approach.
Clinical trials of the vaccine developed with GSK, described as a recombinant vaccine because of the use of GSK's boosting adjuvant, are to start in September.
Trials of the mRNA vaccine candidate should begin around the end of the year, the company said.
Sanofi said it had capacity to produce up to 1 billion doses a year of its recombinant vaccine, and that it would be able to supply up to 360 million doses of its mRNA vaccine annually.
In April, Sanofi said it had manufacturing capacity for 600 million doses for its recombinant vaccine, with the ambition to double production by mid-2021.
The company also said it would expand its collaboration with Translate Bio on developing vaccines, in a deal which will give the U.S. group $425 million in upfront payments. —Reuters",GMA News

""We confirm the MHRA's [Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency] rolling review of our potential COVID-19 vaccine,"" an AstraZeneca spokesman said.
In rolling reviews, regulators are able to see clinical data in real time and have dialogue with drug makers on manufacturing processes and trials to accelerate the approval process.
The approach is designed to speed up evaluations of promising drugs or vaccines during a public health emergency.
AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine is being developed along with the University of Oxford. Bloomberg reported on Friday that MHRA had also begun an accelerated review for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate from Pfizer Inc.

AstraZeneca and Pfizer are among the frontrunners in the race to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, with the race also including Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc . Their vaccine candidates are in late-stage trials, interim data from which are expected in the coming weeks.
The British drug maker said on Monday its COVID-19 experimental vaccine produces an immune response in both old and young adults. The vaccine also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, it said.
The novel coronavirus has killed more than 1.19 million people globally, damaged the world economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.
Work began on the Oxford vaccine in January. Called AZD1222 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, the viral vector vaccine is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that causes infections in chimpanzees. — Reuters",GMA News

The study, backed by the US government, involves about 1,000 adults.
The results were published on the medical website medRxiv in advance of peer review.
Of the several hundred participants with data available for the interim analysis, the results showed that 98% had neutralizing antibodies, which defend cells from pathogens, 29 days after vaccination.
However, immune response results were available from only 15 participants over age 65, leaving open the question of whether elderly people, one of the populations most at risk, will be protected as effectively as others.

In participants older than 65, the rate of adverse reactions such as fatigue and muscle aches was 36%, much lower than the 64% seen in younger participants, the results showed, suggesting the immune response in older people may not be as strong.
The researchers said more details on safety and effectiveness will follow when the study is completed.
But there were no serious side effects, and based on the results so far, J&J kicked off a 60,000-person trial of the vaccine on Wednesday.
A single shot, versus a rival two-dose approach being tested by Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, could simplify distribution of the vaccine.
COVID-19 burden on US minorities extends to children
Minority groups in the United States are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and the disparities extend to children, doctors in Washington reported Thursday in the journal Pediatrics.
In March and April, they tested 1,000 children for the novel coronavirus.
Overall, roughly one in five children tested positive.
But while 7% of white children tested positive, 30% of Black children and 46% of Hispanic children did so.
After accounting for age, sex and family income, compared to white children, Black children had more than twice the odds of a positive COVID-19 test, and Hispanic had more than six times the odds.
Black and Hispanic children were also far more likely to have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.
The study could not identify causes of these disparities.
But study co-author Monika Goyal of Children's National Health System in Washington told Reuters the differences ""appear to be driven by greater exposure to the virus. There's nothing to indicate any type of genetic predisposition to COVID-19 based on race or ethnicity.""
In many minority families, parents or caregivers may not have the luxury of telecommuting or staying home from work if they are sick, Goyal said, adding, ""Our societal structures and policies that differentially impact communities based on economic and racial/ethnic lines in turn impact health outcomes. It is all connected."" -- Reuters",GMA News

In a television interview, Remulla said the local government has identified the high-risk individuals who would join the trials, including policemen, drivers of public transport vehicles, factory workers, and senior citizens

""It's not Cavite per se but Cavite and La Salle HSI, the medical school. They have a very good track record in epidemiology and they're the ones being tasked to join in this medical trial. Cavite will help La Salle HSI in getting the high-risk people in joining the vaccine trial. It should start in the next two weeks,"" Remulla told ANC.

Earlier, Remulla said at least 10,000 Cavite residents are set to be subjected to a Phase 3 field trial of two pharmaceutical companies for a COVID-19 vaccine.

He said the residents would undergo swab testing first before being subjected to clinical trials.

He also said choosing those who would be part of the trials is not focused in one barangay but the entire Cavite province.

Remulla also said it would take a month to know the result of the medical trials.

Asked if the matter has been coordinated with the Department of Health, Remulla said it was La Salle who coordinated with the health agency.

""I've been very clear, it's spearheaded by La Salle. La Salle has been in coordination with DOH but La Salle cannot do it on its own so they're partnering with us,"" the governor said.—AOL, GMA News
