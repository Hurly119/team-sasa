The Philippine government needs a key measure on indemnification funds to be signed into law
Philippine pandemic officials announced the delivery of the country’s first batch of coronavirus vaccines could be expected by mid-February. But with that timeline looking less likely to be met, the Duterte government’s task force officials announced there would be a slight delay in the arrival of vaccines due to, of all things, paperwork.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr and National Task Force COVID-19 Deputy Chief Implementer Vince Dizon pointed to documentary requirements involving an indemnification fund as the culprit behind the delayed schedule.
Why do we need an indemnification fund?
An indemnification fund, Galvez earlier told lawmakers during congressional hearings, was necessary for the Philippines to gain access to vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies as well as the COVAX global facility.
He requested lawmakers to consider bills that would provide for such in mid-January, adding it could give the Philippines an opportunity to gain access to larger supplies of vaccines and increase public confidence in the government’s rollout.The reason why indemnification funds or programs are required of countries is because vaccines being used worldwide are still under emergency use authorization (EUA), with only limited short-term data available on the full effects that could arise from receiving a shot.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities like COVAX, along with vaccine manufacturers, will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events. This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting vaccines emergency use approval.“You’ll have an indemnification program because there is no full data yet. So if an unexpected adverse event happens, any company cannot be sued because you enter an agreement with the company where you are guaranteeing them that you will take responsibility for any adverse event because you’re aware the data is not complete yet – but you’re allowing its use because there is a national emergency,” said Dr Aileen Espina, a public health and family medicine specialist and member of the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC).
“That’s why we’re particular that for any vaccine that will be used, the benefits outweigh the risks,” she added.
But vaccines aren't here yet. What else should the government do?
On Monday night, February 15, Galvez said that task force for vaccine procurement officials have done their part in submitting requirements needed to facilitate Filipinos’ access to vaccines. This is on top of efforts by the Department of Health.
Specifically, government lawyers have finished fine-tuning details of an indemnification clause with COVAX and are now waiting on the facility, the World Health Organization (WHO), and Pfizer to finalize it. (Among the vaccines expected to arrive in the Philippines in the first quarter of 2021 are those developed by Pfizer, BioNTech, and AstraZeneca.)
On Wednesday, February 17, Galvez said that the Philippine government has already signed onto the agreements.
The vaccine czar said it was now waiting on Congress and the WHO to ensure the availability of an indemnification fund and concur with the Philippines’ proposed indemnification program, respectively.“Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO (The ball is with Congress and the WHO),” Galvez said.
While requirements for vaccines coming from COVAX are steps away from being finalized, lawmakers in Congress will still need to pass measures creating an indemnification program to facilitate access to vaccines purchased through agreements between the Philippines and vaccine manufacturers.
Why are we talking about indemnification only now if it's important?
The government was informed of the indemnification requirement only during the latter phase of vaccine negotiations.
Senator Sonny Angara said on Wednesday, February 17, that this issue was not even raised during the 2021 budget deliberations, ""otherwise, [Congress] would have put a fund on that.""
Galvez first informed the Senate about the need for legislation on the indemnification program during committee of the whole hearings in January. It was only on February 11 that the urgency of this measure was tackled in depth during a public hearing.
Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO.
SECRETARY CARLITO GALVEZ JR
Why do we need a law? Won't this further delay vaccine arrival?
A law is needed to be able to tap into the Contingent Fund, as this expense was not covered under the GAA, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado told Rappler.
National Task Force COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon said a law is also being required by vaccine manufacturers, aside from the COVAX facility, to hold them free from any liabilities for severe adverse effects arising from immunization.
COVAX officials earlier listed this as part of requirements for all countries participating in the global scheme to ensure equitable access to vaccines, saying vaccine manufacturers were reluctant to guarantee supplies if they were not indemnified against possible liability.“Given the unprecedented speed and scope of deployment of recently licensed vaccines, manufacturers have highlighted the risks of unforeseen claims due to injury associated with the vaccine. Manufacturers are reluctant to deliver COVID-19 vaccines if this risk is not addressed,” COVAX said.For countries like the Philippines that will receive donated vaccines from the facility, COVAX said a model indemnification agreement will already be incorporated in agreements with manufacturers to decrease time spent for negotiations.
Where will the government source indemnity payments?
Since there was no allocation in the P4.5-trillion 2021 budget, the Philippine government and Congress have to look where they could source this.
During a February 11 Senate hearing, two options were considered:
For the indemnity payments to be included under PhilHealth's coverage using its funds
Tapping into the P13-billion Contingent Fund in the national budget, which would require a law
During that hearing, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that PhilHealth did not include this in its corporate budget this year, but that the state health insurer will ""study"" the possibility of tapping into its P116-billion reserve funds.
The result of the February 11 hearing is Senate Bill (SB) 2057, which is currently being tackled at the upper chamber's plenary. The bill is proposing the creation of a P500-million indemnification fund to be sourced from the Contingent Fund. This will cover compensation in case of death and medical treatment for vaccine recipients experiencing severe adverse effects.
In the House of Representatives, lawmakers have also filed a counterpart measure through House Bill No. (HB) 8648, which seeks to exempt local government units from bidding requirements under the procurement law, grant tax exemptions for vaccines, and create an indemnification fund for the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.So far, HB 8648 does not include an immunity clause, nor an amount that will be allocated for the indemnification fund.
Who will implement the indemnification program?
According to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, while funds will be administered by PhilHealth, the DOH will be in charge of implementing the indemnification program where adverse events linked to a vaccine may be determined.
This means that if someone were to experience a serious adverse reaction, the DOH, through its post-monitoring of vaccinations, will determine if an adverse effect is indeed linked to the vaccine. If so, PhilHealth would cover the cost of care, with funds sourced from the indemnity fund.

What's the status of pending bills in Congress?
Both Senate and House bills were already sponsored at the plenary. At the upper chamber, interpellations will resume on Monday, February 22, before the Senate version of the indemnification bill is scheduled to be passed on 2nd reading.At the House, amendments to HB 8648 were finalized on Wednesday. It is also up for 2nd reading.
At their current pace, the bills could be passed on final reading during the last week of February or during the first week of March due to the 3-day interval rule between the 2nd and 3rd reading. Since the current versions of the Senate and House bills are different, there's also a chance of a bicameral conference committee (bicam).
If President Rodrigo Duterte certifies the vaccine bill as urgent – as requested by Galvez – Congress can do away with the 3-day interval rule.If the President issues the certification in the last week of February, then there’s a chance that both chambers will also be able to pass the bills on final reading that same week. To further hasten the process, the Senate or the House may need to adopt the other chamber's version, so that a bicam won't be needed. The bill will then be up for signature by the President for it to become law.
Once a law is passed, will we get our vaccine supply immediately?
This will still depend on when the government will sign supply agreements with vaccine firms, as well as the capacity of vaccine manufacturers to deliver doses to all countries that have locked in orders.As it stands, Galvez said only term sheets have been signed with vaccine manufacturers as of mid-February. Term sheets are the second to the last step in vaccine negotiations required to lock in logistics needed for production and delivery.For the last step, a supply agreement will still need to be signed with these companies to facilitate actual purchase and payment, as well as set a definite date for delivery.
Galvez earlier said that current limited global supply has prevented vaccine manufacturers from entering binding supply agreements with the government. – with reports from Mara Cepeda/Rappler.com",Rappler

(UPDATED) On March 1, the Philippines finally begins to legally roll out COVID-19 vaccines, with the first doses from Sinovac
For nearly a year, President Rodrigo Duterte used speech after speech to claim that salvation from the pandemic would come from one thing only: vaccines. Now, the Philippines is just weeks away from starting an immunization campaign that aims to deliver exactly that.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr outlined the ambitious targets the government had for its vaccine program: secure at least 148 million vaccine doses and inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos within 2021 – just enough to reach the recommended 60% of the population scientists estimated was needed to reach herd immunity against COVID-19.In reaching these goals, Galvez, along with other pandemic and health officials face challenges that have stumped even the wealthiest of countries when distributing vaccines to the public.With the distribution of the country’s first vaccine doses slated for February, the Duterte government’s timeline for its vaccine plan in 2021 hinges on many things – including delivery, storage, local government plans, and drawing up of masterlists – going right.Where things stand now
On Monday, March 1, the Philippines officially began rolling out COVID-19 vaccine doses.At 9:40 am, the first COVID-19 vaccine in the country was legally administered by nurse Sherlock Cruz to Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the few coronavirus-designated hospitals in the country.
Along with Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, government medical adviser Dr Edsel Salvana, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, and deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon were also vaccinated.
To secure vaccines, the Philippine government has been in talks with at least 7 companies, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, Sinovac, Gamaleya, and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica).Galvez said of the 7 companies, there were 5 with whom term sheets have been signed.Term sheets are the second to the last document that needs to be signed. It sees companies commit to supplying doses for Filipinos.Actual delivery and use will depend on details agreed upon in supply deals and whether the vaccine is granted emergency use authorization from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration.As the main person in charge of vaccine negotiations for the Philippines, Galvez said supply deals were scheduled to be signed by the end of February. All contracts for vaccines were expected to be finalized by mid-February, he added.In terms of preparations for the actual deployment of vaccines on the ground, various local government units (LGUs) have been running simulation exercises to rehearse their plans for storing, transporting, and distributing vaccines in their communities.The Department of Health, along with task force officials, approved the vaccines plans of several LGUs in Metro Manila, with more expected to be cleared in the coming weeks.SCREENSHOT FROM NATIONAL TASK FORCE COVID-19
1ST QUARTER: 'Mini rollout'
The first 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine donated by the Chinese government arrived in the Philippines on February 28.Sinovac was the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, following Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Sinovac’s vaccine was the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility, which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February. This included 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine and 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine earlier expected to arrive courtesy of the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization (WHO).
COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila – the epicenter of the pandemic in the country – will be prioritized for the initial vaccine supplies. The following hospitals were listed:Philippine General Hospital
Lung CenterDr Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala)
Veterans Memorial Medical Center
Philippine National Police General Hospital
Victoriano Luna Medical CenterOther vaccines like AstraZeneca which were expected to arrive in the first quarter will likewise be prioritized for frontline health workers caring for patients in high-risk areas or places where infections rates were still high. (The Philippines expected to receive at least 5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine from COVAX.)Galvez said this phase of the government’s vaccine plan will be considered a “mini rollout” as it will cover some 1.7 million healthcare workers, along with other government frontliners who will be responsible for mounting the vaccine rollout in the coming months.2nd QUARTER: Vulnerable sectors, 'economic frontliners'
By this time, the government expects 10 to 15 million doses of vaccines to arrive in the country, on top of more vaccines to be supplied by COVAX.WHO Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasignhe said the country is potentially looking at receiving a maximum of 9.2 million doses by March or April, while the remainder of the 44 million doses it was entitled to through COVAX will come at the end of the year.The 9.2 million doses will be AstraZeneca’s vaccine manufactured in South Korea, though the actual amount will depend on manufacturing capacity, Abeyasinghe said.Galvez said these vaccines will be used to inoculate members of vulnerable sector such as senior citizens and indigent Filipinos. The government is also eyeing to start the vaccination of “economic frontliners.”During these months, supplies of AstraZeneca’s vaccine ordered by the private sector and local government units are also expected to start arriving in the country.MUST READ

3rd QUARTER: 'Massive rollout' begins
At this point, we should expect the Duterte government’s vaccine rollout to be in full swing as bulk of vaccines purchased should start arriving in the Philippines.The number of doses to be made available in these months was somewhere between 30 million to 50 million, Galvez said. The amount would be enough to start inoculating about 25 million Filipinos.Based on negotiations, some of the vaccines that may be delivered during these months include those developed by US pharmaceutical firms Moderna and Novavax.Galvez earlier signed a term sheet securing at least 30 million doses of Novavax vaccine to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, while Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said Moderna was among companies willing to supply doses to the Philippines by mid-2021.4th QUARTER: Targets reached?
In the latter months of the year, what Galvez described as the “full rollout” of vaccines will continue as bulk of vaccines procured through negotiations will be delivered.These months will be crucial if the Duterte government is to reach its goal of inoculating 50 million to 70 million Filipinos. Galvez spelled out the stakes in the campaign, saying the country needed to reach this number if it is to achieve herd immunity and jumpstart economic recovery. – Rappler.com

(UPDATED) Malacañang says 487,200 doses from the COVAX global facility will be handed over to the government
The Philippines will receive its first shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines on Thursday, March 4, days after logistical concerns and supply problems delayed the delivery of doses originally scheduled for March 1.“This is to confirm that the initial shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines is set to arrive tomorrow,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said on Tuesday, March 3.
Roque said 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine would be handed over to the Philippines on Thursday at 7:30 pm. The latest number of doses to arrive is lower than the 525,600 doses the Philippines had expected to receive on March 1.
Roque did not say why the number of AstraZeneca doses to be delivered on March 4 was lower.
Roque earlier said that President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to witness the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines supplied by the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization.Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr thanked countries including Germany, the Republic of Korea, and European Union for donating to the COVAX facility, saying the Philippines was ""deeply grateful"" for their contribution.
Why this matters
The latest batch of vaccines from the COVAX facility will allow at least 243,00 more health workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A considerable number had turned down Sinovac's vaccine, opting to wait for AstraZeneca’s vaccine to be delivered to the country.
The Philippines earlier received 600,000 Sinovac doses donated by China on February 28, though enthusiasm for the vaccine was muted amid concerns over its lower efficacy and the robustness of its data compared to other vaccines. (READ: Philippines begins legally rolling out first COVID-19 vaccines)

(UPDATED) Its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine, after a review of late-stage trial data reaffirmed the shot was safe and effective.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo made the announcement in a virtual press briefing on on Monday, February 22, just a day before Duterte government officials said Sinovac’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines.“After a thorough and rigorous review of the currently available published and unpublished data by our regulatory and medical experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac Life Science Company,” Domingo said.Sinovac is now the third company to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines. Its approval follows that of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s, and may speed up the start of the country’s inoculation campaign set back by delays in paperwork and limited global supply.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Monday that the Chinese embassy in Manila advised Philippine officials it would need 3 to 5 days to prepare for the delivery of vaccines once emergency use for it was issued in the Philippines.Aside from the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil have granted emergency authorization for the Chinese vaccine.Not for use among health workers
While the FDA granted Sinovac’s vaccine emergency approval, Domingo said the FDA’s regulatory and medical experts cited conditions and recommendations for its use in the country.Foremost among these was that experts did not recommend its use among health workers, as the group has high exposure to COVID-19.A review of published and unpublished data on the vaccine from ongoing Phase 3 trials showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2% among healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old. The findings, coming from community trials in Indonesia and Turkey, means the vaccine is a viable option for this group.But its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
“The safety profile is good, adverse events were mild to moderate, and possibility of allergy or anaphylaxis is minimal,” Domingo said in Filipino. “When the vaccines arrive in the country, this can be usedin groups where safety and efficacy is proven – 18 to 59 year old clinically healthy individuals.”
Under scrutiny
The emergency approval of Sinovac’s vaccines comes after Philippine lawmakers in the Senate scrutinized the Duterte government’s seeming preference for the Chinese vaccine despite reportedly higher prices and lower efficacy findings compared to other vaccine options.
Before the EUA was issued, health experts held off on judging the vaccine due to limited publicly available data on late-stage trials. Despite this, some of the government’s expert advisers sought to quell concerns over the country’s decision to consider the vaccine, saying its findings on preventing severe COVID-19 infections and death can contribute toward the government's goal of taming the pandemic.
The use of Sinovac in the Philippines is among the few that will be done from the government’s direct purchase of vaccines. Duque said some 600,000 doses may be delivered before the end of the month.
Domingo stressed that while the FDA granted Sinovac an EUA, it is not full approval. Securing full marketing authority – which is necessary to commercialize and sell the vaccine – would be contingent on Sinovac’s commitment to finish development of the product. – Rappler.com",Rappler

(3rd UPDATE) The arrival of donated COVID-19 vaccines from China paves the way for the start of the Philippines' inoculation campaign, among the last to start in Southeast Asia
The Philippines' first batch of coronavirus vaccines arrived in the country on Sunday, February 28, paving the way for the start of its mass inoculation campaign with shots developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.
The aircraft carrying the vaccines – a transport plane of the People's Liberation Army of China – landed at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City around 4:10 pm on Sunday.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel. That is light at the end of the tunnel,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in an interview with state-run network PTV. ""At least nagsimula na po tayo. At tuluy-tuloy na po."" (At least we have started. And this will continue.)
The delivery of 600,000 doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac – a donation from the Chinese government – was set to be witnessed by President Rodrigo Duterte, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr at the Villamor Air Base.
Malacañang earlier hailed the delivery of Sinovac's vaccine, which would be used to jump-start the country's vaccination campaign in several hospitals across Metro Manila.
Though the Duterte government had targeted to start distributing vaccines by February, the Philippines is now among the last countries in Southeast Asia to start vaccinating its residents. It was the last to receive vaccine doses in the region.
The arrival of the vaccine comes days after the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for CoronaVac last Monday, February 22.
Sinovac is the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, though its vaccine is the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February.
China first announced it would donate vaccines to Filipinos during the official visit of Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Manila last January.
Senator Bong Go, former presidential aide, said on Sunday that Galvez, Duque, and other Cabinet secretaries will be among the first government officials to be vaccinated with Sinovac on Monday, March 1.
Duterte, 75, will not be receiving Sinovac as the FDA, along with government experts, did not recommend its use for senior citizens or those 60 years old and above. Data from late-stage trials had mostly been gathered from participants 18 to 59 years old.
""To my fellow Filipinos, these vaccines are backed by science and deliberated by our Filipino experts. I encourage that you get vaccinated at the soonest possible time and be a partner in preventing the further spread of the disease,"" Duterte said in a speech.
Health workers go first
Aside from several government officials, health workers were identified as a priority to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
In a press conference later on Sunday, Duterte said health workers who refuse to take Sinovac “have a choice,” and can wait for the other vaccines that are set to arrive in the country.
“Kung ayaw nila ng Sinovac, maghintay sila,” he said. “In a few days, there has been quite a… basta I was assured that [AstraZeneca] would be coming within the next few days.”At least 525,600 doses of vaccines developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is expected to arrive in a week, after it was postponed from March 1.
In issuing Sinovac an EUA, the FDA said data from Phase 3 trials in Brazil, where a lower efficacy of 50.4% was observed, led experts not to recommend its use for priority groups. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The recommendation spurred days-long deliberations among experts part of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, who later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, reiterating it is safe and effective.
With vaccine supply scarce and delivery of different brands uncertain, experts said health workers should be given the chance to receive an available vaccine since they are most exposed to COVID-19. In the meantime, health workers who will refuse to get Sinovac were given assurances they would not lose their place in the government's prioritization.The FDA granted emergency approval to Sinovac after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
Aside from the Philippines, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and Laos have granted emergency authorization for Sinovac's CoronaVac. – with reports from Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com

(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision clears the way for the use of a vaccine expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign
The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for the local use of the vaccine that is expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign.The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is the second to be given emergency use approval in the Philippines, where health officials are closely monitoring infections after the detection of the more infectious United Kingdom (UK) variant in the country.Its approval comes nearly two weeks after the FDA gave approval to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine which had been the first to apply for emergency authorization in the country.“After a thorough review of the currently available data, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of AstraZeneca ” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA and that the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Strategic vaccine
AstraZeneca and Oxford’s vaccine is poised to become a dominant shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.
The Philippine government, private sector, and several local governments had earlier entered intro tripartite deals with the drug maker to secure up to 17 million doses of the vaccine for Filipinos. (READ: PH vaccine stockpile from AstraZeneca reaches 17 million doses)
Supplies were expected to arrive sometime in the second quarter of the year, though vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr earlier said that the government was negotiating for an earlier delivery “at the soonest possible time.”
Unlike other vaccines the Philippines eyed to buy, AstraZeneca was among the few companies that have so far expressed willingness to enter into tripartite deals involving local governments and the private sector. Other companies said to be open to the setup are US drug makers Moderna and Novavax.
Health experts earlier said that AstraZeneca’s vaccine would also be easier to distribute inpoorer and harder-to-reach areas, considering it can be transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months, making it compatible with the Department of Health’s (DOH) storage facilities.Early analysis of clinical trial results showed an average efficacy of about 70% after the first dose. The vaccine was seen to be 90% effective in participants who were given a half dose, followed by a full dose. This was compared to 62% efficacy seen in participants who were given two full doses.While the FDA granted AstraZeneca an EUA, it is not yet a full approval.
Securing full marketing authority– which is necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allows its sale in the local market – would be contingent on AstraZeneca’s commitment to finish development of the product. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says the Philippines expects to receive about 5.1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and about 24.1 million doses in the second quarter
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said that the government is willing to pay more to secure earlier access to COVID-19 vaccines within the first half of the year.
Galvez made the statement during a televised meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday night, February 24, after setbacks in the delivery of initial doses delayed the start of the country’s inoculation campaign that was eyed to begin by February.""Iyong ongoing negotiation po natin sa mga ibang vaccine ay kailangan po na ina-ano po namin na kung puwede silang magkaroon ng early delivery. At nagne-negotiate din po tayo kahit mapamahal nang kaunti basta ma-early delivery lang po sila ng second quarter at saka po ng first quarter,"" Galvez said.
(In our ongoing negations for vaccines, we’re asking if it's possible to have an early delivery. We’re negotiating to have early delivery in the second and first quarter even if vaccines will be slightly more expensive.)
The retired general said that the Philippines expects to receive about 5.1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and about 24.1 million doses in the second quarter.He explained that the ""technique"" they're using is to try to get an earlier delivery of vaccines even at higher prices so that the increase in the prices could be ""offset earlier"" as well.
Galvez and other Philippine pandemic officials earlier targeted to start the country’s mass vaccination campaign by the end of February with doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine to be supplied under the COVAX global facility. But paperwork and the lack of an indemnification law in the country have stalled the delivery of vaccines to be used on priority sectors including health workers, senior citizens, and vulnerable populations.Aside from vaccines to be supplied by COVAX, the Philippines is in talks to directly purchase shots from Moderna, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), US firms Pfizer and BioNTech, British firm AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute.Galvez said officials are also trying to negotiate with the United Kingdom, China, India, and Russia to increase vaccines expected to be delivered to the Philippines in the first quarter.Under the current timeline of deliveries, the Philippines expects to receive the bulk of vaccines in the third to fourth quarter of 2021 for a “major” rollout.Galvez said the Philippines is supposed to receive 161 million doses by the end of 2021 to vaccinate 50 to 70 million adult Filipinos “in a best case scenario.” This number would be just enough to reach the recommended 60% to 70% of the population to reach herd immunity against COVID-19, based on scientists' estimates. – Rappler.com

(3rd UPDATE) Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, is the first to get the vaccine
Editor's Note: The nurse who administered the first shot to Dr Gerardo Legaspi is Charleuck Santos, not Sherlock Cruz. Cruz was the name provided by the Philippine Information Agency, and was corrected by the Department of Health.
The Philippine government on Monday, March 1, started distributing the first shots of a coronavirus vaccine, setting off an unprecedented and ambitious effort to inoculate at least 50 million people by the end of 2021.At 9:40 am, the first COVID-19 vaccine in the country was legally administered by nurse Charleuck Santos to Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the few coronavirus-designated hospitals in the country.
Along with Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, government medical adviser Dr Edsel Salvana, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. were also vaccinated.
The hopeful step opens a new chapter in the Philippines' fight against the pandemic in spaces that have catered to the sickest. The disease has so far killed over 12,300 and infected over 576,000.Along with PGH, vaccinations on Monday take place among health workers at the Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center.Doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac were used for the start of the Duterte government’s first rollout, after arriving in the country through a transport plane of the People's Liberation Army of China on Sunday, February 28. The delivery of 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses, a donation from China, was witnessed by President Rodrigo Duterte, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.Inoculations took place after the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for CoronaVac last Monday, February 22. Sinovac was the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, though its vaccine was the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility, which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February.
Health workers were identified as the first group to receive the Sinovac vaccine, though their participation came after intense deliberation on whether to include them in the rollout. The FDA earlier said data from Phase 3 trials in Brazil, where a lower efficacy of 50.4% was observed, led experts not to recommend its use for priority groups.But with vaccine supplies scarce and the delivery of different brands uncertain, vaccine experts decided health workers should be given the chance to receive an available vaccine since they are most exposed to COVID-19.
In the meantime, as more vaccines have yet to be delivered, those who choose not to get the Sinovac vaccine are given assurances they will not lose their place in the government's prioritization.At PGH, health workers were reluctant to receive the Sinovac vaccine. Days before the rollout on Saturday, February 27, the PGH Physicians Association urged officials to wait for the review of the country’s Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) before using donated Sinovac vaccines.
Health experts pointed out the HTAC’s review was necessary as the body “does not solely focus on cost minimization issues for the State, but also include “ethical, legal, social, and health system implications.”

PART 1: Rappler sifts through plans of officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country
In February, the Philippines will embark on its biggest mass immunization campaign yet, as it prepares to dole out coronavirus vaccines that could end the health emergency – but not without testing the country’s strained health system and pandemic response once more.To get a picture of the scale of the challenge, consider this: Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje said the largest vaccination campaign the government has ever conducted, so far, involved inoculating about 29 million Filipinos. Annual routine immunization programs aim to reach about two million children nationwide.
But targets for a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 eclipse these figures, as the campaign aims to cover from 50 million to 70 million Filipinos in 2021 alone. Its desired end stage has a much more ambitious goal: reaching all 110 million Filipinos spread across the archipelago by 2024.For the unprecedented task, the government has partnered with the private sector to facilitate requirements needed for storage, delivery, to actual distribution and tracking of vaccines.In Part 1 of this explainer, Rappler sifts through plans of key officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country. In part 2, we will detail the government's strategy for distributing vaccines from storage facilities to the public.
Which vaccines may arrive first?
In a best case scenario, doses of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine may be the first to arrive in the Philippines come February. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said this could happen through the Gavi COVAX facility which planned to supply doses to low-income countries for an early rollout.
Pfizer is, so far, the only company that has secured emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – a requirement necessary for any vaccine to be used on the public.
Aside from the Pfizer vaccine, Galvez said Sinovac and AstraZeneca's vaccines may be next to arrive in the country, considering that doses for the two vaccines were already secured in negotiations.
Both Sinovac and AstraZeneca still need to be cleared by the FDA. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the agency is waiting for Phase 3 trial data from Sinovac before it can move on to a full review, while AstraZeneca's EUA application is currently under evaluation.

How will vaccines be brought to the Philippines?
Galvez said delivery of vaccine supplies will be the responsibility of vaccine companies and manufacturers, based on current negotiations being finalized.Once vaccines arrive in the Philippines, officials will take up to 15 days to inspect the items, he said. At the House of Representatives and Senate, Galvez also asked lawmakers to pass legislation that would ensure the speedy release of doses from Customs, recalling similar past experiences where personal protective equipment couldn’t get to hospitals that needed them because of Customs requirements.Experts warned the rollout of vaccines could be severely delayed, and the quality of supplies compromised, if necessary measures were not taken to prevent the items from being held up in Customs. Where will vaccines be stored?
Health experts identified two strategies for storing vaccines, depending on their required temperature conditions.The first covers vaccines that need storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C and -20°C. For these, suppliers will transport doses to the Department of Health’s (DOH) rented private warehouse or the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM), which is the main storage location of vaccines used for the government’s National Immunization Program.
From here, vaccines will be transported to the DOH’s 17 centers for health development that serve as regional hubs.Citing their experience in storing vaccines for measles, polio, and other routine immunizations, the DOH earlier said there are enough storage facilities in the country for vaccines that need to be kept at 2°C to 8°C and -20°C. These include main sites in Metro Manila, regional centers, as well as provincial capitols.SCREENSHOT FROM DOH
What about vaccines needing ultralow temperature storage?
As for vaccines that will require -70°C or ultracold storage facilities, like those of Pfizer and BioNTech, distributors will transport doses to private warehouses of third party logistics providers tapped by the government.The DOH said final terms of agreements are still being discussed with companies with extensive experience in handling pharmaceutical products, including Zuellig Pharma Group, Royal Cargo, Orca, Maersk, LBC, and Metro Pacific, among others.This comes on top of the 10 ultralow freezers the government procured to store more vaccine doses requiring frigid temperatures, and 5 ultralow units available in RITM, that can store over 1.1 million doses.In an interview with Rappler, Zuellig chief business officer Jannette Jakosalem said the company has ordered 10 ultralow freezers that can each store about 400,000 to 500,000 vaccine doses. Zuellig Pharma – the biggest distributor of pharmaceutical goods in the Philippines – also has plans to purchase 4 more ultralow freezers for use in Cebu City and Davao City.
Partnerships with the logistical companies will be even more crucial in August, when the DOH will need assistance in storing vaccines needing storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C.Duque earlier said that the DOH expected vaccines for its regular immunization programs to arrive by then, and that it was crucial for these child vaccination programs to continue amid a COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says 'more or less' 7 manufacturers will supply the vaccine doses for an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Wednesday, January 6, that the government is targeting to secure at least 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the country in 2021.The supply of 148 million, if fully secured, could cover some 70 million Filipinos, assuming two doses are needed per person. National Task Force deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said the government wanted to vaccinate 50 to 70 million people within the year.
Galvez said the 148 million-figure was based on current negotiations with “more or less 7” vaccine companies that the government was in advanced talks with, including Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), Sinovac, and Gamaleya.“We hope to close a deal with these companies this month,” he said in a virtual press briefing.What's the timeline?
Galvez did not give specific dates on when vaccine doses from these companies may arrive in the Philippines.He earlier said he expected Sinovac's vaccine to arrive in the Philippines as early as March, but this would depend on whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the vaccine for emergency use. Sinovac has not yet applied for the necessary emergency use authorization (EUA) with the FDA.(READ: How FDA grants emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccines, meds)
So far, a solid purchase deal was signed with AstraZeneca, the government, and private sector in November 2020. This is for the purchase of some 3 million doses expected to arrive around the second quarter of 2021.Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, meanwhile, is applying for Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, while the FDA recently approved clinical trials for Janssen’s vaccine that could start later this month.Galvez also recently told President Rodrigo Duterte that the Serum Institute of India, which partnered with Novavax to produce its vaccine, promised to set aside 30 million doses for the Philippines.
As for Pfizer, no updates have been given after Galvez signed a confidentiality data agreement with the company in November 2020. Pfizer is the only vaccine company that has applied for an EUA with the FDA as of January 6. (READ: Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?)

Why it matters
Launching a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 is crucial in taming the pandemic as soon as possible, though the Philippines has been lagging behind in a global race to secure supplies of the coveted good.
A recent study published in the BMJ medical journal found that based on advance purchase commitments, high income countries already reserved over half of doses to be supplied from 13 leading manufacturers.“Even if all 13 of these vaccine manufacturers were to succeed in reaching their maximum production capacity, at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022,” the study said. – Rappler.com",Rappler
https://www.rappler.com/nation/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-eyed-philippines-senior-health-workers,AstraZeneca vaccine eyed for Philippines' senior health workers,SOFIA TOMACRUZ,2021-03-04 13:06:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group is meeting to discuss how the initial 487,200 AstraZeneca doses will be distributed
The first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Philippines may be allocated for senior healthcare workers unable to receive Sinovac's CoronaVac, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Thursday, March 4.
Galvez said this strategy is being considered by members of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), who were meeting to discuss how the initial 487,200 doses will be distributed across the country.""Most likely – may mga doctor kasi na nagsasabi i-priority natin 'yung mga senior healthcare workers…. Our recommendation is for 'yung mga senior healthcare workers,"" Galvez said in an interview with CNN Philippines' Pinky Webb.(Most likely – we have doctors who are saying we should prioritize senior healthcare workers. Our recommendation is for the senior healthcare workers [to get the AstraZeneca vaccine].)
Galvez gave the update as the Philippines is scheduled to receive its first delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine supplied by the global COVAX Facility on Thursday night. The delivery was supposed to be last Monday, March 1, but was stalled by logistical problems and supply concerns.
The 487,200 doses arriving on Thursday are fewer than the 525,600 doses the Philippines had first expected to receive last Monday.
Galvez said the smaller delivery is due to logistical and packaging constraints as the AstraZeneca vaccine will be delivered to the Philippines through a commercial flight.
Why this matters
Health officials are hoping more health workers will be inclined to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, the only other option to be made available so far aside from Sinovac's vaccine donated by China to the Philippines.
Two days since the Philippines started rolling out Sinovac's vaccine, only some 8,559 health workers have been vaccinated. Enthusiasm for the vaccine was muted amid concerns over its lower efficacy for health workers exposed to COVID-19 and the robustness of its data compared to other vaccines.
But while a considerable number of health workers had turned down Sinovac's vaccine, opting to wait for AstraZeneca's shot, doses are still extremely limited for the priority group.

Janssen, the pharmaceutical firm of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a vaccine using a“non-replicating viral vector” called Adenovirus 26, whichhas been genetically engineered so it can still invade cells but can’t replicate and cause disease. The company used the same method to develop vaccines for Ebola and other diseases.Unlike most other candidates, Janssen’s vaccine utilizes a single dose. Despite this, the company said it would use some Phase 3 trials to study the effects of two doses given 56 days apart.Its vaccine can also be stored in standard refrigerated facilities, making the prospect of distributing and administering vaccines easier for lower income countries like the Philippines. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The vaccines will come a day after Sinovac’s CoronaVac arrives in the country
The Philippines will receive 525,600 doses of vaccines developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford on Monday, March 1, Presidential Spokesperson confirmed on Saturday, February 27.
The vaccines are part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX facility, from which the Philippines is entitled to 44 million COVID-19 vaccine doses. (READ: What is COVAX and why does it matter for getting vaccines to developing nations?)

(UPDATED) This first shipment from the COVAX Facility, together with the earlier Sinovac doses, gives the country the ability to vaccinate over 540,000 individuals
Close to 500,000 doses of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University arrived in the Philippines aboard a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines commercial plane on Thursday night, March 4.
The shipment arrived around 7:20 pm at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Metro Manila.
The vaccines were picked up from Belgium and had a stopover in Bangkok, Thailand, before heading to NAIA in Metro Manila.
President Rodrigo Duterte welcomed the shipment in a ceremony at the Villamor Air Base that was delayed because he arrived two hours late, at around 9:30 pm.
From there, the vaccines were to be brought to a warehouse of logistics company Metropac Logistics in Marikina City.
Testament to collaboration
In his speech at the ceremony, Duterte thanked the COVAX Facility, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, WHO, and ambassadors who made the vaccine shipment possible.
Meanwhile, WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the arrival of the AstraZeneca shipment is a ""testament to the strength of collaboration, cooperation, and compassion.""
He also praised Duterte's ""strong leadership"" amid the pandemic.
According to the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the distribution of the vaccines throughout the country will ""immediately commence after repackaging.""
A total of 487,200 doses arrived, less than the 525,600 doses the government expected to receive last Monday, March 1.
The smaller delivery was due to logistical and packaging constraints that came with the commercial flight, according to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, known as AZD1222, is a viral vector vaccine that requires two doses and can be stored in normal refrigerator temperatures (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).
It is composed of an adenovirus derived from chimpanzees and modified to train the vaccine recipient's immune system to fight the virus that causes COVID-19.
First from COVAX Facility
The AstraZeneca shipment is the first shipment of vaccines from the COVAX Facility led by the World Health Organization, an initiative that ensures equitable access of COVID-19 jabs in developing countries.
The delivery came through after an expected shipment of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine – also secured through COVAX – did not arrive in mid-February as earlier promised by the government.
The Pfizer shots were supposed to have been the country's first COVID-19 vaccines.
The delay was due to the country's lack of an indemnification law, as well as disagreements over the scope of indemnity for Pfizer.
The Pfizer shots from COVAX are now expected to arrive in the 2nd quarter of 2021, or April at the earliest.
First shipments reserved for medical frontliners
The AstraZeneca doses, along with the first shipment of Sinovac vaccines, bring the Philippines' number of COVID-19 vaccine doses to 1,087,200.
This is good for only 543,600 individuals or 32% of the 1.7 million health workers deemed a priority of the vaccination program.
However, the Philippines is set to procure 1 million more doses of CoronaVac, the Sinovac vaccine, this month, according to Galvez. This would bring the number of doses to nearly 2.1 million or enough for 1,043,600 individuals.
The AstraZeneca doses are being eyed for elderly health workers since the Food and Drug Administration did not recommend CoronaVac for persons older than 59 years old.
However, this will still depend on the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 vaccines (NITAG), the government vaccine experts crafting recommendations on how approved vaccines are to be administered.
The NITAG held a meeting earlier on Thursday to formulate such guidelines for the AstraZeneca vaccines.
As of Wednesday evening, March 3, the Philippines has vaccinated 9,077 individuals, mostly health workers in Metro Manila.
The vaccine rollout in Visayas began on Thursday, with the region's first shot administered to Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr, chief of the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center in Cebu City. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The President again declares his vote of confidence for China and Russia vaccines, saying he prefers them to US vaccines
Stepping up his populist messaging during the pandemic, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said his goal is for his government to shoulder COVID-19 vaccination for each Filipino.
He declared this during a ""message to the people"" aired late Wednesday, October 14, after his meeting with coronavirus task force officials.
""I have the money already for the vaccine. But hahanap pa ako ng maraming pera (I will look for more money) because, you know, there are now 113 million Filipinos and to me, ideally, all should have the vaccine. Without exception, lahat (all),"" said Duterte. ([PODCAST] Duterte, Trump, Bolsonaro: The 'medical populists')
This departs from his previous speeches when he said wealthy Filipinos will not get such assistance from the government because they can ""buy their own vaccine.""
Duterte reiterated that priority will be given to the poorest Filipino households (specifically those listed as conditional cash transfer beneficiaries), soldiers, and police. The Chief Executive previously said he trusts only the military to distribute the vaccine when it becomes available.
Can the government afford it?
No economic manager was present at the Wednesday meeting. So far, we know that Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III targets a P20-billion fund for the purchase of a COVID-19 vaccine.
This fund will come from a loan to be provided by the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government financial institutions. The loan will be given to the Philippine International Trading Corp, which has been authorized to purchase vaccines for the government.
This fund is to shoulder only an ""initial"" batch of vaccines.
Apart from this, there's a P2.5-billion allocation for vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget.
Preference for China, Russia vaccines
Though Duterte never lacks in emphasizing his dire need for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, he indicated a preference for certain vaccines in his Wednesday speech.
""Para sa akin (For me), it's either China or Russia, okay na ako (I'm okay with that),"" he said.
""Wala akong – sinasabi nila Pfizer, Moderna, 'yung western, US. Okay rin 'yan kasi may proseso nga eh,"" Duterte continued. (I have nothing – they say Pfizer, Moderna, the western, US. They're also okay because there's a process.)
But he reserved a ringing vote of confidence for a Chinese or Russian vaccine, saying he'd be ""glad to open up [his] sleeves"" for an injection if China or Russia would just give him a call.
""Those of you who are asking if the Chinese vaccines are safe? I can say China is a modern country and it has all the wherewithals to make its country whose integrity is fully protected by its achievement,"" said Duterte.

As for Russia, the President said he had spoken to outgoing Russian Ambassador Igor Khovaev about plans to put up Russian pharmaceutical facilities in the Philippines.
The conversation took place during Khovaev's farewell call to Duterte at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse earlier that day.
Philippine vaccine experts are still studying documents sent over by Russia's Gamaleya Institute about the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of its vaccine, Sputnik V. The expert panel will decide whether or not to green-light Phase 3 clinical trials for the vaccine in the Philippines.
Duterte has declared he has so much confidence in the Russian vaccine that he is willing to be the first to get inoculated with it.
Though Duterte is partial to a China or Russia vaccine, the Philippines is also participating in the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility.
Through this initiative, the Philippines is assured a supply of some 20% of its vaccine needs, a supply that would likely include whatever vaccine is proven effective, whether or not from China or Russia.

According to one rumor circulating in the Philippines, the coronavirus vaccine will allow President Rodrigo Duterte to kill people at the push of a button.
Elsewhere in the country of 108 million, memories of a dengue vaccine that has been banned locally are putting people off the idea of immunization even before the campaign begins.
""Many kids got sick after receiving that vaccine,"" 62-year-old Crisanta Alipio said of the ill-fated vaccine against dengue, a mosquito-borne disease that can be deadly.
She said she was afraid of the novel coronavirus but even more afraid of vaccination.
The Philippines is due to start immunizations next month despite suffering Southeast Asia's second-worst outbreak of the coronavirus with more than half a million infections and over 10,000 deaths.
But officials acknowledge they have an uphill struggle to persuade many people to take it, on top of the logistical difficulties in reaching 2,000 inhabited islands with a precarious health system in the Southeast Asian archipelago.
""Messaging has to be very concrete and evidence-based to encourage people to receive the vaccines,"" health undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told Reuters.
""We are assuring Filipinos that whatever vaccines that will be brought in and provided will go through a stringent process of regulation.""
Dengvaxia scare
Confidence in vaccines was knocked by controversy over French company Sanofi's Dengvaxia.
Rolled out rapidly in 2016 to more than 800,000 children to protect them from dengue – it was banned after its maker said it could worsen the disease in people who had not previously been exposed to the infection.
That led to two congressional enquiries and more than 100 criminal cases that linked child deaths to the anti-dengue shot – though such links have never been proved.
Sanofi has repeatedly said Dengvaxia is safe and effective and the vaccine has been approved for use by the United States and European Union.
After that episode, the Philippines fell from one of the top 10 countries for confidence in vaccines to no higher than 70th place. The number of children who were fully vaccinated fell from 85% in 2010 to 69% in 2019.
To address the fears, health workers would hold town hall and online meetings and be given special training on how to answer questions, said Carlito Galvez, a former army general running the anti-COVID-19 campaign, told the Senate.
The aim is to inoculate 70 million adults this year.

In parts of the southern Philippines, the big fear is of a state-sponsored death campaign – not completely far-fetched in a country where Duterte's drug war has left nearly 6,000 thousand dead since he took office in 2016.
Remote southern regions are the scene of both communist and Islamist insurgencies.
""Some of the information shared on Facebook and text messages said the COVID-19 vaccine contained a microchip which can be controlled remotely by President Duterte, and once he pushes a button, the person who received the vaccine will die,"" said Nasser Alimoda, a government doctor in Lanao del Sur province.
Everywhere, there is concern over the specific vaccines that the Philippines plans to use too – particularly over Chinese company Sinovac Biotech's vaccine, for which one study showed effectiveness of little over 50%, though another gave it over 91%.
One opinion poll showed fewer than a third of Filipinos were willing to get inoculated against coronavirus.
""Vaccination programs will go to waste if people refuse to get the shots,"" a former health minister, Esperanza Cabral, told Reuters.

Keeping it secret
Sobejana declined to name the unit where the soldiers belonged to, but Año identified the Presidential Security Group (PSG) – which is composed of soldiers, cops, coast guards, and civilian personnel – as a beneficiary of the early vaccination.The Armed Forces of the Philippines, in a statement on Monday afternoon, confirmed that the soldiers belonged to the PSG.
As for the Cabinet officials, Año declined to name them, citing their right to privacy. Año appeared to have one Cabinet official in mind when he was asked to reveal their identities.
“I cannot confirm it unless that person will say that he’s confirmed [to have had the vaccine]. Only he can give the confirmation,” Año said.
Was the process followed?
Año and Sobejana said the vaccination was necessary as the Cabinet officials and soldiers were considered frontliners. It is unclear if they followed the government’s own process for vaccine approval.
Under Duterte’s own order, only the Food and Drug Authority can issue emergency use authorizations (EUAs), which could cut the review period of 6 months down to 1 month only.Duterte signed the order on December 2. It is unclear how the vaccines were properly processed in such short period of time.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says that once doses are delivered to the Philippines, some 50,000 health workers in Metro Manila could be vaccinated in February
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Monday, January 11, the Duterte government could begin distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the public as soon as February 2021.Galvez told Senators that initial doses of a vaccine may arrive in the country by February 20 at the earliest, and that based on this timeline, public inoculation may begin “more or less” in the 3rd to 4th week of the month.Galvez, however, issued a disclaimer that delivery dates were still “indicative” and that actual delivery could happen at least 1 to 2 weeks earlier or later.“Safe to say we will be having that maybe last week of February,” Galvez said, referring to the rollout of vaccines, when pressed by Senator Panfilo Lacson to provide a starting date for vaccination.Galvez said doses expected to arrive in February would “most likely” come from GAVI’s COVAX facility, with the multilateral initiative currently finalizing deals to distribute some 30 billion doses of a vaccine to developing countries for an early rollout.World Health Organization country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said negotiations were taking place to finalize a deal that could include Philippines in countries to receive doses for an early rollout, adding Pfizer and BioNTech’s was among vaccines being considered for this set up.
Aside from this, Galvez said China’s Sinovac vaccine may also arrive as early as February, with necessary agreements to be signed later in the week.Who will get the vaccine first?
Health officials earlier said the government would prioritize distributing COVID-19 vaccines to priority groups including frontline health workers in high risk areas such as Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Cebu City, and Davao City.Galvez said officials estimated some 50,000 health workers in Metro Manila could be vaccinated in February once supplies arrive, while some 2 million more could be immunized by April.MUST READ

What's the status with negotiations?
The Philippines has so far signed deals to purchase at least 30 to 40 million doses of Novavax’ vaccine, while tripartite agreements with local government units and the national government has secured at least 13 million of AstraZeneca’s vaccine for Filipinos.
Aside from this, the country is finalizing deals with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceuticals), Moderna, and Gamaleya. Galvez expressed confidence that the government could lock in deals with these companies to secure at least 100 million doses within the year.If all deals in advanced negations were successful, Galvez said the country could purchase some 148 million doses in 2021 to vaccinate some 50 to 70 million Filipinos. – Rappler.com",Rappler

President Rodrigo Duterte defends Chinese-made vaccines, claiming they are every bit as reliable as Western ones
The Philippines has signed an agreement for 25 million doses of CoronaVac, the coronavirus vaccine of Chinese firm Sinovac.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr confirmed this in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 13.
""They gave a commitment, and I signed the term sheet and had a copy of the signed term sheet for 25 million [doses] sent to Hong Kong,"" he said in Filipino.
An initial batch of 50,000 doses is expected to arrive in the country on February 20, to be followed by 950,000 more doses in March.
Galvez praised Sinovac for being the ""only"" vaccine maker to give definite monthly delivery dates for its doses.
Why this matters
The signing of the term sheet adds to the Philippines' list of agreements, locking in millions of the sought-after jabs for Filipinos.
Previously signed were deals for 30 million doses of the vaccine of US firm Novavax and 15 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through tripartite agreements with local governments and private corporations.
However, the Food and Drug Administration is yet to approve any vaccine for emergency use. Of the 3 vaccines secured through signed deals, only AstraZeneca has applied for emergency use approval as of writing.

Duterte defends Chinese vaccines
In the same meeting, Duterte defended Chinese-made vaccines, claiming they are every bit as reliable as Western ones.
""It's as good as any other bakuna na na-imbento ng mga Amerikano or mga Europeans. Hindi nag-kulang ang Chinese, hindi sila nagkulang sa utak,"" said the Philippine leader.
(It's as good as vaccines invented by the Americans or Europeans. These Chinese don't lack in brains.)
""Kung kayong walang pera at gusto ninyo ng bakuna na mas maganda, mas mabisa, wala, tabla lahat ‘yan. Pareho lang ang pinag-aralan nila,"" Duterte also said.
(If you don't have money and you want a vaccine that is better, more effective, that's nothing, all of them are equal. They all have the same expertise.)
The Sinovac vaccine, however, has raised eyebrows for producing very different efficacy rates across various clinical trial sites.
In Brazil, where Sinovac's biggest clinical trial is being conducted, the vaccine was initially said to be 78% effective in preventing mild cases of COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing severe infections. But new data showed that the overall efficacy rate is 50.38%.
Sinovac has also published less clinical trial data compared to Western vaccine makers. – Rappler.com",Rappler

(UPDATED) Here’s what you need to know about the process of approving clinical trials, when a COVID-19 vaccine might be rolled out, and who might receive it first
Over 9 months into the pandemic, scientists around the world continue to develop a viable COVID-19 vaccine as countries fight the spread of the new virus that has infected millions.
Here in the Philippines, a panel of vaccine experts under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has been reviewing a roster of potential vaccines with the interest of conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the country.

Searching for a coronavirus vaccine: What PH clinical trials will look like
Filipino diplomats abroad have also been in talks with vaccine developers and manufacturers to make sure the Philippines has access to an effective vaccine once it becomes available. Among these are vaccines being developed in the US and China.
But these efforts are only half the challenge in ensuring Filipinos are able to receive a COVID-19 vaccine once it is ready for mass use.
While clinical trials and discussions take place with vaccine developers, any potential vaccine will still need to go through regulatory processes in the Philippines before studies here can begin, or the use of vaccines can be allowed.That includes vaccines President Rodrigo Duterte has shown a preference for – like Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine and those being developed by research and pharmaceutical firms in China or the United States’ Moderna.On Wednesday, December 2, Duterte issued an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization for vaccines. This makes granting the necessary FDA approval for vaccines quicker as it can be issued 21 days after a government agency or company asks it to evaluate a particular vaccine.
Here’s what you need to know about how the Philippines will approve trials, how they will be regulated, and when a COVID-19 vaccine might be rolled out to the public.What's a clinical trial?
Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect humans’ health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.Trials need to be carefully designed, reviewed, and approved before they can start. Like most clinical trials, tests for a COVID-19 vaccine consist of 3 phases to determine its safety and efficacy.In the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the body tasked with regulating clinical trials.Why regulate trials?
Clinical trials deal with humans as subjects. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said this means that in any study, “the primary concern is always their human rights and safety.”By regulating trials, there is oversight in the way these are crafted, ensuring that trials meet good clinical practice standards and are able to ethically conduct tests involving humans.What might this look like? Domingo said participants should be able to understand fully what trial they are volunteering to join, as well as its benefits and risks. Volunteers should also know what safeguards will be afforded them, like close monitoring, checkups, and health insurance. Participants should also be free to leave the study.In regulating trials, the FDA will also form its own panel of experts to review adverse events that could occur during trials. This will be apart from the clinical trial expert team and safety monitoring committee part of the DOST.
Aside from this, clinical trials are regulated to ensue the integrity of data collected, which will be used to determine whether or not a treatment is ultimately safe and effective. This is especially true in the case of vaccines, which require extreme safety since they are designed to be given to millions of healthy people.
Who can conduct trials?
Only establishments with an FDA-issued license to operate as a clinical trial sponsor or contract research organization can conduct trials in the Philippines. This ensures that the group carrying out the research is legitimate and has the capacity to conduct such studies.In the case of Phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, interested groups will also need to secure the endorsement of the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel (VEP) and ethics review board.The added step in securing approval from the country’s VEP and ethics board is unique to COVID-19 vaccine trials, Domingo said, because the global search for a vaccine has become much more accelerated due to the pandemic.In this case, the VEP reviews data from Phase 1 and 2 trials of vaccine development companies that intend to conduct Phase 3 trials in the country. Meanwhile, the ethics board ensures that prospective trials will be carried out in such a way that the rights and health of volunteers are protected.What vaccine companies are interested in trials?

TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Domingo said it may take at least 21 days for FDA regulatory reviewers to evaluate and process applications of companies seeking to do trials. This includes 14 days for initial evaluation and a period of 7 days for applicants to respond to any clarifications.After this, the FDA is expected to issue a decision on applications in not more than 8 days after it receives the recommendation of regulatory reviewers.Vaccine experts earlier eyed to have Phase 3 trials start by October, though this has been moved to November 2020.
After trials, what happens next?
Once clinical trials are successfully completed and a vaccine is demonstrated to be safe and effective for humans, companies can apply for a certificate of product registration. The FDA is again in charge of evaluating and approving these.Conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines is not a prerequisite for a vaccine to be registered for use in the country.In evaluating a vaccine or any type of medicine, the FDA reviews its scientific data and can also consult with other similar regulatory bodies in other countries to compare findings.Apart from this, the Philippines is also a participant in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization COVAX facility designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.

What is COVAX and why does it matter for getting vaccines to developing nations?
When will a vaccine be available – and who will receive it first?
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr has said the soonest a vaccine may arrive in the Philippines would be sometime between May to June in 2021 at best, though a more “realistic” timeline was late 2021 to early 2022.While many candidate vaccines are still in their development phase, manufacturers have also begun the work of preparing for production and distribution.
In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) is in the planning phase of how to handle the complex procurement, storage, and distribution of vaccines once they are available.In administering the vaccines to Filipinos, the DOH has experience in carrying out mass vaccination programs through similar campaigns done in the past for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and polio.Duterte earlier said he wanted the entire Filipino population inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine “without exception,” adding that his goal was for the government to shoulder the costs for the country’s 113 million population.This remains unlikely for now. In reality, the DOH said it lacked P10 billion of the P12.1 billion needed to vaccinate an initial priority population of 20 million Filipinos.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez earlier said the country aims to source P73.2 billion ($1.5 billion) to pay for the COVID-19 vaccinations of 60 million Filipinos.Funds will be taken from loans from multilateral agencies like the Asian Development Bank and World Bank; domestic sources like LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines, and government corporations, and bilateral sources from countries where a vaccine is being developed.
As for who may receive the vaccine from the government first, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III gave an overview of groups to be prioritized. These include the following:Health care workers (including those in public and private hospitals, barangay health stations, COVID-19 treatment and rehabilitation centers)
Government frontline workers (including those in the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Education, Bureau of Corrections, Bureau of Fire Protection, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology)

(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision paves the way for the Pfizer vaccine to be given to Filipinos, but actual delivery remains uncertain as the government has yet to finalize a supply deal with the company
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for its use in a country hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia.
The historic approval – a first of its kind in the Philippines – was issued on Thursday, January 14, marking a milestone in the country’s fight against the disease which has so far infected over 492,000 people and killed nearly 10,000.""The FDA today is granting an emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine. It is decided that all conditions for an EUA are present and that the benefit of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risks,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA. In particular, evidence from well known and controlled trials showed that “it is reasonable to believe” that the vaccine may be effective to “prevent, diagnose, or treat COVID-19.”
Aside from this, the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Why it matters
In a best case scenario, the FDA decision would mean that the Pfizer vaccine can be distributed to Filipinos in a matter of weeks, with health and pandemic officials targeting an initial rollout by the end of February.In reality, the timeline of the vaccine administration and the actual number of doses that will arrive remain uncertain as the government has yet to finalize a supply deal with Pfizer. (READ: Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?)
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said the company committed to deliver 25 to 40 million doses to the Philippines if there was excess supply from the United Stares and other countries which had secured orders earlier.
For now, the identified February rollout will greatly depend on whether or not the country is included in the GAVI COVAX facility’s list of states that may get doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for an early rollout pegged for the coming month.Galvez said the government would submit an appeal to COVAX by January 15 to have the Philippines included among countries that will be given a share of doses. Between January 19 to 29, officials from the COVAX facility are also scheduled to inspect ultracold chain storage facilities necessary to keep Pfizer’s vaccine stable, as part of its assessment on whether the country was ready to receive it.Aside from demonstrating 95% efficacy, Pfizer's vaccine offers a boost of hope in taming the pandemic as preliminary studies showed it would likely remain effective against mutations of COVID-19.
The FDA’s decision comes 22 days after Pfizer officials filed an EUA application with the agency. Pfizer was the first to apply for emergency use in the Philippines, followed by British drug maker AstraZeneca.Worth noting
Once the first batch of the Pfizer vaccine arrives in the country, Galvez said it can only be distributed in Metro Manila, Cebu City, and Davao City, as these areas have the facilities to keep the vaccine at a temperature of -70°C (- 94 degrees Fahrenheit).The actual distribution would also be complicated. Health experts have cited the necessary preparation to handle the new vaccine when administering it to patients.
Pfizer officials earlier explained that while doses may last up to 6 months in ultra-low temperature freezers, they can be stored up to 30 days in thermal shippers the company designed, and up to 5 days in normal refrigerated 2-8°C conditions – posing a challenge for the Philippines’ health system.Frontline health workers in areas reporting high incidence of cases are among those prioritized to receive initial doses of the vaccine.
While the FDA granted Pfizer an EUA, it is not full approval. Securing full marketing authority– which is necessary to commercialize the vaccine – would be contingent on Pfizer’s commitment to finish development of the product.More on Pfizer
In November 2020, Pfizer became among the first companies to announce results showing its vaccine was 95% effective. The findings shattered expectations of a vaccine developed at breakneck speed and offered hope that the end of the pandemic was in sight.The Philippines is the latest country to clear the Pfizer vaccine, after the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Germany, Australia, and Israel, among other countries – Rappler.com",Rappler

Malacañang makes the announcement on President Duterte's preferred vaccine ahead of the Food and Drug Administration
Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical firm, has applied for Emergency Use Authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine, Malacañang said on Monday, March 1.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque made the announcement ahead of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the government agency that receives EUA applications and is in charge of processing them.
Initially, Roque had said that Sinopharm planned to submit an EUA ""within the day."" But in a matter of minutes, after checking messages on his mobile phone, the Duterte spokesman issued a new announcement.
""I stand corrected. It has been filed. They have already filed with the FDA an application for EUA for Sinopharm vaccine,"" he said from the Philippine General Hospital, where vaccinations of healthcare workers were underway using another Chinese vaccine, Sinovac's CoronaVac.
Yet FDA Director General Eric Domingo has said he is yet to see Sinopharm's EUA application. As of writing, the FDA itself is yet to confirm the Malacañang announcement.
Duterte's preferred vaccine
The Sinopharm vaccine is Duterte's preferred anti-COVID-19 jab, as announced previously by Malacañang.
Roque had even said Malacañang lawyers were studying if the compassionate special permit allowing Duterte's security aides, the Presidential Security Group, to use 10,000 Sinopharm vaccine shots could provide legal basis for the Chief Executive to get those shots as well.
As of Monday, Malacañang's legal staff have yet to make a decision on the matter, said Roque.
The Sinopharm vaccine is at the heart of a controversy on smuggled vaccines.
Former special envoy Ramon Tulfo Jr, some PSG personnel, a senator, Cabinet member, and other high-ranking government officials were able to get Sinopharm vaccines in violation of regulatory processes and ahead of healthcare workers.
Despite this, Malacañang and Duterte himself have not moved to hold these individuals accountable. The President even instructed PSG members not to cooperate in any investigations.
Critics have said the Palace's hands-off stance smacks of preferential treatment and disdain for processes and regulations other Filipinos must follow. (READ: Malacañang after Mon Tulfo illegal vaccination: He can do as he pleases)
Roque, on Monday, even said the PSG's illegal vaccinations in 2020 could be covered by the FDA special permit for 10,000 new Sinopharm vaccines, thus absolving the PSG of liability.
""In law, there could be instances when we ratify acts earlier done because of subsequent acts. But my initial legal opion is it could have the affect of ratifying something earlier,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
Yet FDA Director General Domingo had earlier stressed that the special permit is not retroactive and covers only the 10,000 Sinopharm vaccines yet to be delivered. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The Duterte government starts its vaccination drive as vaccine hesitancy increases, experts warn of an uptick in cases, and vaccine supplies remain uncertain
Over a year since its first reported coronavirus case, the Philippines on Monday, March 1, will finally start rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, offering hope for a country among the hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia.The start of the Philippines’ vaccination campaign sets off an unprecedented effort to tame the global menace by inoculating at least 50 million people against a disease that has killed over 12,300 and made over 576,000 sick.But long-anticipated vaccinations face multiple uncertainties ahead as vaccine supplies and deliveries to the country remain erratic, and as experts warn of an uptick in cases amid the spread of a variant from the United Kingdom and discovery of a “mutation of concern” in Cebu City.Unknown curveballs
While the Philippines is launching its vaccine drive with 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac – a donation from the Chinese government, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III announced 525,600 AstraZeneca vaccine doses earlier scheduled to arrive on Monday will be delayed for ""about a week,” owing to a “global supply problem.’The delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines was welcome news after an initial batch of 117,000 Pfizer doses expected to arrive in the country in mid-February was stalled due to undone paperwork for an indemnification fund.
Aside from this, the timeline of the delivery of other COVID-19 vaccines eyed by the Duterte government, including those developed by Moderna, the Gamaleya Research Institute, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax remain unknown as the Philippines has not yet been able to sign supply deals pinning down a date for arrival.This comes as experts just last Saturday, February 27, warned of a “serious increase” in cases in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the country’s pandemic, and recent upticks in cases across several provinces in past weeks.In its latest report, the Octa Research Group on Saturday, February 27, said that the reproduction number (R) – the number of people that one COVID-19 positive case can infect – in the capital region climbed to 1.43 after managing to remain below 1 earlier in the month.""This is similar to the rate of increase observed in Cebu City, Mountain Province, and Benguet, where specimens of the SARS-CoV-2 variant were identified based on genome sequencing,"" it added.The increase in infections and the virus’ reproduction number pose a threat to vaccinations as experts warned rising cases would mean more Filipinos will need to be vaccinated against the disease faster.Vaccine hesitancy rising
Adding to hurdles, the arrival of vaccines comes as vaccine hesitancy increases across the Philippines, with about only 19% of Filipinos saying in a recent survey that they would be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
The figure, released from a survey by the Octa Research Group, is lower than numbers in earlier surveys. Among these were surveys conducted by Pulse Asia which found 32% of Filipinos saying they were willing to get vaccinated if a COVID-19 shot were available in November to December of 2020.A Social Weather Stations survey conducted in September 2020 found 66% of Filipinos were willing to get vaccinated at the time.Health officials are currently targeting to vaccinate at least 50 million to 70 million Filipinos by the end of 2021 – just enough to reach the recommended 60% to 70% of the population that scientists estimated was needed to reach herd immunity against COVID-19. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Dr Gerardo Legaspi, director of the Philippine General Hospital, is the first person to legally receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines
After weeks of delay, the Philippines finally started its COVID-19 vaccination drive, among the last to do so in Southeast Asia.
Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Gerardo ""Dr Gap"" Legaspi was the first to roll up his sleeves as he received his shot of CoronaVac developed by Chinese company Sinovac.
Legaspi is also the first health worker in the country who received a legal COVID-19 vaccine following the unauthorized vaccination of several high-ranking government officials and close-in security personnel of President Rodrigo Duterte.
PGH nurse Chareluck Santos administered the vaccine shot to Legaspi.
Here's what we know about Legaspi:
Legaspi has been into active practice and teaching in neurosurgery for 25 years now.
In the Philippines, he pioneered awake craniotomy surgery, a brain surgery performed on patients who are awake.
His expertise includes treating aneurysms, arteriovenous malformation,brain tumors, congenital malformations of the brain and spinal cord, and skull base surgery.
He is the former president of the the ASEAN Neurosurgical Society and the Academy of Filipino Neurosurgeons Inc.
He has clinics in PGH, St Luke's Medical Center, and the Medical City.
He also works as a consultant in other government institutions as well, like Philippine Children's Medical Center, AFP Medical Center and Davao Regional Hospital in Tagum, Davao del Norte.
After Legaspi received the shot, Filipina actress Saab Magalona recalled how the doctor saved the life of her son after performing two brain surgeries.
Aside from Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo and health department adviser Dr Edsel Salvaña also received their first shot of the Sinovac vaccine.
The kickoff of the mass vaccination drive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, comes as health workers express reluctance to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
Domingo earlier said that CoronaVac's lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
FDA instead recommended its use to people aged 18 to 59 after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
The recommendation spurred days-long deliberations among experts belonging to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, who later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, reiterating it is safe and effective. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The Philippines' richest families move to get COVID-19 vaccines for the country, once available. Will the private sector do the heavy lifting once again?
The Philippines' richest families are chipping in to ensure the availability of around one to two million COVID-19 vaccines widely expected to hit markets by mid-2021.
National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer Carlito Galvez Jr thanked Enrique Razon Jr, Lucio Tan, Ramon Ang, the Sy siblings, and Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion for placing orders for over one million vaccines through advance market commitments (AMCs) – a financing mechanism that basically assures funders of the vaccine once produced.
""Nagpapasalamat po tayo kay Enrique Razon na mayroon po rin siyang binigay na 300,000 doses. Ang BDO at saka po 'yung ibang mga Lucio Tan Group at saka San Miguel Corporation saka Go Negosyo, nakapag-raise na po sila ng more than one million. And hopefully, baka tataas pa 'yon ng one or two million doses,"" Galvez said in a briefing at Malacañang on Tuesday, November 17.
(We thank Enrique Razon, he will give 300,000 doses. BDO, the Lucio Tan Group, and San Miguel Corporation, and Go Negosyo as well, they were able to raise over one million [vaccines] and hopefully raise one to two million more doses.)
Galvez noted that the tycoons are set to donate 50% to 80% of what they are set to procure, while the rest will be given to their essential workers at no cost.
The private sector has played a big role in the Philippines' pandemic response. From donations of various goods, to testing employees and poor households, conglomerates have stepped in, as the government has drawn flak for how it is handling the crisis.
Private sector
Galvez's latest statements point to the private sector doing some heavy lifting once more – this time, in vaccinating the country's entire population of around 108 million, as President Rodrigo Duterte's economic team allotted a meager amount for the much-needed vaccine.
The proposed 2021 budget contains only P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement, with several lawmakers expressing dismay over the allocation.
The Department of Health (DOH) has estimated that it needs around P12.9 billion to meet the target of vaccinating at least 20% of the entire population for free. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)
The DOH earlier explained that the proposed budget was crafted before Duterte's directive to vaccinate the entire population, which is why only P2.5 billion was allocated for the COVID-19 vaccine.
Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III is targeting a P20-billion fund for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccine through a loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines.
Galvez likewise urged Duterte to enter into deals with the private sector for vaccine financing and procurement.
""We have also various modes of financing including private-public tripartite agreement without the cost [to] the government,"" Galvez said.
""So the private sector will finance it by buying directly [from] the vaccine company…with the regulation [by] the DOH…who will decide where the vaccine will be given.""
In the same briefing, Galvez recommended that the government enter into an AMC, with the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank to act as finance managers.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier recommended the creation of an executive order, which would allow the Food and Drug Administration to issue emergency use authorization to hasten procurement.
The Philippines is currently looking at 17 possible sources of vaccines from various countries.
Out of the 17, 9 are currently undergoing the 3rd phase of trials, with Pfizer and Moderna reporting promising results.
Galvez noted that trials will be conducted in the Philippines in December 2020 and January 2021. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Zamboanga City
Mayor Beng Climaco announced on Monday that Zamboanga City was ready to purchase COVID-19 vaccines amounting to an initial P200 million from the city’s 2021 Executive Budget.What's the bigger picture?
Galvez earlier said health officials want frontline health and government workers, senior citizens, indigent Filipinos, and uniformed personnel to be the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines.But no less than President Rodrigo Duterte himself revealed in December that certain members of his Cabinet and close-in security have already been immunized – and with unregistered COVID-19 vaccines at that, a clear violation of the national government’s own laws and protocols.
Government officials have so far failed to properly explain how the unregulated immunization efforts took place. – with reports from Mara Cepeda, Ryan Macasero, Pia Ranada, Bonz Magsambol, and Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com

‘We have been developing our own vaccine for the past 3 months,’ says Indonesian President Joko Widodo
No, they’re not just waiting for vaccines from China or Russia.
Unlike the Philippines, Indonesia is developing its own coronavirus vaccine, which the country expects to complete by mid-2021.
“We have been developing our own vaccine for the past 3 months, specifically from the COVID-19 virus strain spread in Indonesia. Hopefully the vaccine will be ready soon and it (vaccine development) is expected to be completed by mid-2021,” said Indonesian President Joko Widodo, as quoted by the Jakarta Post on Tuesday, August 11.
Jokowi was speaking at the launch of the vaccine’s late-stage human trials, the Jakarta Post said. The vaccine is being developed by the Indonesian state-owned enterprise Bio Farma in partnership with Sinovac Biotech of China.
“We are proud that a state-owned enterprise like Bio Farma in partnership with Sinovac Biotech of China are able to begin phase III clinical trials. Not many countries or institutions have been able to reach this stage,” said Indonesia’s State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir.
This is part of Indonesia’s long-term strategy to fight COVID-19, knowing it might be difficult to gain access to other countries’ vaccines.“Therefore, it is necessary for Indonesia to develop its own COVID-19 vaccine. And it will be by Indonesia, from Indonesia, to Indonesia,” said Ali Ghufron Mukti of Indonesia’s research and technology ministry, in another Jakarta Post report.
In contrast, the Philippines, which has invested little in scientific research through the years, concedes it has no means to produce its own vaccine. Instead it is banking on a short-term strategy of joining clinical trials of other countries – a move Indonesia is also taking.

Searching for a coronavirus vaccine: What PH clinical trials will look like
Even as vaccines are being developed in many other parts of the globe, President Rodrigo Duterte said he prefers to wait for vaccines from China and Russia. Duterte had begged China to prioritize the Philippines once a vaccine is available, while he was willing, in the words of German news outlet Deutsche Welle, to be Russia’s guinea pig once its vaccine is ready.
While they diverge on vaccine development, however, the Philippines and Indonesia have one thing in common: the two countries are Southeast Asia’s worst performers in fighting the coronavirus.The Philippines recently overtook Indonesia as the Southeast Asian country with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, but Duterte spokesman Harry Roque downplayed this development, claiming the Philippines has more cases because it conducts more coronavirus tests. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III says the fund will be enough to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos. Is this enough to attain herd immunity?
The Philippines aims to come up with P73.2 billion ($1.5 billion) to pay for the COVID-19 vaccinations of 60 million Filipinos, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, November 23.
""P73.2 billion financing that's pretty much – most of it is already fixed,"" he told Duterte and other Cabinet members who met in Davao City to discuss measures against the pandemic and other issues.
Dominguez spelled out the sources of this fund.
""Low cost, long-term"" loans from multilateral agencies like Asian Development Bank and World Bank - P40 billion
Domestic sources like LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines, and government corporations - P20 billion
Bilateral sources from countries where a vaccine is being developed - P13.2 billion
The finance chief, however, tempered expectations, saying the P13.2 billion funds estimated to come from bilateral arrangements is ""not completely negotiated.""
$25 to vaccinate one Filipino
Dominguez estimated that it would cost an average of $25 or P1,200 to vaccinate one Filipino.
This would mean that with a P73.2 billion budget, the government will be able to pay for the vaccination of 60 million Filipinos or slightly less than 60% of the country's population.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III backed up Dominguez, saying this number of inoculated Filipinos is enough to achieve herd immunity, or the resistance of a community to a disease due to immunity of a high-proportion of its people.
""Herd immunity, Mr President, is anywhere from 60% to 70%, according to the World Health Organization. If we’re able to reach that, we’re going to pretty much arrest the spread of this and mawawala yung COVID-19 sa ating lipunan (and COVID-19 will disappear from our society),"" said Duque.
""So basically, 60 million [people] is okay and we have funds for that,"" said Dominguez in response.
Studies on vaccines say that the percentage of a population required to achieve herd immunity will largely depend on how effective the vaccine is.
In the same meeting, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said his strategy for distributing the vaccine would be to prioritize doses for coronavirus ""hotspots"" like Metro Manila, Davao City, Bacolod City, and others.
Then the vulnerable sectors in these cities or provinces would be given the vaccines first – poor households, health workers, military and police.
The proposed 2021 budget contains only P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement, disappointing several lawmakers.
The Department of Health has estimated that it needs around P12.9 billion to meet the target of vaccinating at least 20% of the entire population for free. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)
Status of vaccine negotiations
The government is already negotiating with 4 vaccine developers – Pfizer (US), AstraZeneca (United Kingdom), Sinovac (China), and Janssen (US), said Galvez.
By the end of November, the government will be able to provide its Advance Market Commitment to these firms to reserve a supply of their vaccine, he added.
Galvez was most optimistic about the arrangements for the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying the firm is setting aside 20 million doses for the Philippines and that it is the most affordable, costing ""more or less $5.""
If all goes goes smoothly, said Galvez, distribution of the 20 million doses in the Philippines may take place in the second quarter of 2021 or during the months of April to June. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Until the ceremonial rollout of the country's first vaccines from Sinovac, health workers express reluctance to receive the shot, opting to wait for different vaccines to become available
After nearly 580,000 infections, over 12,300 lives lost, and a year into quarantine restrictions, the Philippines finally launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on Monday, March 1.The historic day, long anticipated by millions as the world receded into lockdown, marked a turning point in the Philippines’ fight against the pandemic.
Government officials who witnessed the arrival of 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines celebrated these as the first “doses of hope” – the moment bringing leaders close to tears, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said.But for most of the country, the delivery of the first COVID-19 vaccines was met with a mix of anxiety, anger, and a lack of enthusiasm as the public had been made to expect the arrival of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines perceived to be better options.At the Philippine General Hospital, where the President’s pandemic representatives gathered for a ceremonial vaccination on Monday, officials spent considerable time convincing health workers to receive the vaccine.“Huwag nating hintayin 'yung tinatawag na (Let’s not wait for the so-called) best vaccine. There is no such 'best vaccine' because the best vaccine is the one that is safe and efficient, and arrives earlier,” Galvez said.Manila Mayor Isko Moreno echoed the appeal, calling available vaccines an “answered prayer.”“Let me address those who are waiting – I will respect you, your beliefs, and your views but kung ako ay tatanungin ninyo…hinihikayat ko kayo, 'wag ninyo ipagpabukas, 'wag ninyo ipagbakasakali ang kaligtasan ninyo,” he said.(Let me address those who are waiting – I will respect you, your beliefs, and your views, but if you ask me, I’m urging you, don’t put off until tomorrow or leave your safety to chance.)Moreno added: “Remember, if not all of you, most of us, most of you prayed last year to have a vaccine. In God’s mercy, he heard us. I think doctors and scientists here will agree that to develop a vaccine takes so many years but God has so many ways to hear us and I think now it’s up to us to act.”MUST READ

Health workers' hurt
Until the day of the ceremonial rollout, health workers from hospitals taking part in the distribution opposed the injection of Sinovac on them, citing its lower efficacy of 50.4% from Phase 3 trials among health frontliners in Brazil.Hospital workers from the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) staged a protest during their lunch break expressing “exasperation” at the Duterte government’s “consistently inconsistent” pronouncements on the mass vaccination program.Health workers criticized the government for passing on the burden of encouraging public trust in vaccination, saying it was the government’s responsibility to provide the best vaccines and be transparent.
The vaccinations on March 1 were the first legal vaccinations in the country, following the inoculation of several officials and government workers with smuggled vaccines in 2020.“Many from our ranks have been infected and some died combating the deadly virus. Our health and lives are always at stake, it is just right and humane that we demand the free, safest, and most efficacious vaccine,” said Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the LCP employees association-Alliance of Health Workers.At PGH, workers also called on the government to deliver the “best” vaccine to health workers. The hospital, among the few COVID-19 designated centers, reported a marked drop in willingness of its employees to get vaccinated days before the start of the rollout.PGH Director Gerardo Legaspi said that over 90% of the hospitals’ workforce had earlier said they were willing to get vaccinated, following the government’s announcement that health workers would receive Pfizer’s vaccine first.
The figure dropped to some 13% after officials said Sinovac would be offered instead, since paperwork on indemnity requirements stalled the delivery of Pfizer doses.Just days before the scheduled rollout, the PGH Physicians Association (PA) decried in a statement the PGH administration for not consulting them, when administrators said the hospital was ready to take “whatever vaccine becomes available.”VACCINATION STARTS.

The physicians urged leaders to wait for the assessment of the country’s Health Technology Assessment Council which reviews the “ethical, legal, social and health system implications” of medical technologies like vaccines, saying this would aid each worker to make a better-informed decision on whether or not to receive Sinovac’s CoronaVac.“The PGH PA stands firm that Sinovac, despite being the only vaccine available at hand should undergo appraisal by the HTAC…. PGH should uphold the ideals of ethical and evidence-based medicine, for which it is a bastion of,” the group said.More reluctance
Meanwhile, at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, health workers were likewise reluctant to receive the Sinovac vaccine, preferring to wait for other vaccines to arrive.
Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, who received the Sinovac vaccine, only appealed to health workers to get themselves vaccinated.The FDA earlier granted Sinovac emergency authorization, but its experts did not recommend it for health workers exposed to COVID-19 since lower efficacy from trials in Brazil had led experts there to not recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
Experts belonging to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, emphasizing that it is safe and effective. With doses limited and deliveries uncertain, health workers should be given the option to choose whether or not to get the Sinovac vaccine, they said.
“Consider yourselves and your personal situation and if you are ready, give your informed consent that you are willing to get vaccinated. Just don’t decide to not get vaccinated,” Domingo said in Filipino.MUST READ

Vaccinations a priority
The decision of health workers to receive a vaccine is made more difficult by the uncertainty of when succeeding vaccines will arrive. At least 525,600 AstraZeneca doses were expected on Monday, but this was delayed by about “a week,” owing to limited global supply.Despite government's vaccine campaign and promises that more shots would be available, there is no guarantee when this would happen.Galvez was scheduled to travel to India from March 9 to 12 to sign the Duterte government’s first supply agreements that would pin down a specific date for the delivery of AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines. Amid the muted response to the Sinovac vaccine, experts who anticipate a surge of new cases in Metro Manila in the coming weeks, said health workers should get vaccinated while the surge is still in its early stages.“Our healthcare workers in the region must seize this opportunity,” Octa Research said.The issue is further compounded by rising vaccine hesitancy, with a recent survey showing some 46% of Filipinos are still unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Former health secretary Manuel Dayrit said in an interview with CNN Philippines that his main concern is how fast vaccinations could continue. He pointed out that 500,000 Filipinos would need to be vaccinated daily to achieve government targets.
The more vaccines are delayed, the more impact this could have on health, rising hunger, and unemployment. While the Philippines was among countries hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia, it was the last in the region to receive COVID-19 vaccines after starting talks with vaccine firms only sometime in November 2020.
Delayed negotiations have narrowed down options for vaccines to be purchased as supplies fluctuate and remain scarce. Until then, Filipinos have no choice but to wait as officials continue to urge people to get themselves vaccinated. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The Department of Health assures the public that Russia's COVID-19 vaccine will be subject to a rigorous review and regulatory protocols before possible use in the Philippines
Philippine officials are eyeing to participate in Phase 3 clinical trials for Russia's COVID-19 vaccine.
The vaccine was touted by Russian President Vladimir Putin as ""quite effective,"" but scientists worldwide have raised concerns over its safety.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Wednesday, August 12, that the Philippines' vaccine expert panel led by the Department of Science and Technology would meet with the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology within the day.
Gamaleya, part of Russia's health ministry, had developed the vaccine in coordination with the country's defense ministry.
""Ang pag-uusapan ngayon (What will be discussed) with the Department of Science and Technology is how we can possibly have the clinical trial here also in the Philippines,"" Vergeire told reporters in a briefing.
Why it matters
Talks on possible Phase 3 clinical trials come as scientists around the world are skeptical about Russia's claim that it has developed a COVID-19 vaccine proven to be both safe and effective.
Experts pointed to the lack of published and transparent scientific data on the vaccine's supposed efficacy.Questions over the vaccine called Sputnik V largely revolve around the rush to declare it ready for use despite the lack of Phase 3 testing. As the last stage in clinical trials, the step is crucial as it involves thousands of participants over several months to determine if a vaccine produces immunity as well as any significant side effects.
Among the experts who raised concerns over the vaccine was renowned US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, who ""seriously doubts"" the Sputnik V vaccine meets these standards.""Having a vaccine…and proving that a vaccine is safe and effective are two different things,"" said Fauci in a National Geographic discussion moderated by ABC News' Deborah Roberts.""I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that,"" he added.The World Health Organization has also yet to give the vaccine its stamp of approval, which would require a ""rigorous review and assessment of all the required safety and efficacy data.""Balancing risks
Despite this, President Rodrigo Duterte said the Philippines is moving forward and discussing specifics such as the possible number of doses to be allocated for the country.
Vergeire, however, tempered expectations and sought to assure the public that vaccines to be used in the Philippines will still be subject to health safety and regulatory procedures.
""Even if it went through regulatory procedures in Russia, when it arrives in the Philippines, it will still go through our own procedures. It's different when it arrives here in the country,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.""This would be a critical study and review…so we are sure [of the vaccine]…. We'll study the dossier [on the vaccine] and review these allegations...and what the findings were during different phases of [clinical] trials,"" she added. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac, a Chinese pharmaceutical company, is among the first expected to arrive in the Philippines
Philippine vaccine czar and National Task Force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr said on Monday, December 14, that pandemic officials have asked Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac to deliver supplies of its COVID-19 vaccine to the country by March 2021.
The targeted date of arrival, if met, will make the vaccine among the first to arrive in the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte has touted a vaccine as the “only solution” to the pandemic.“They (Sinovac) said they are very confident that they will have the sources in April but we are negotiating that March will be our target,” Galvez said during a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday.
Sinovac is currently among 4 vaccine candidates that are in advanced stages of negotiations with the Philippines. The company is also applying for Phase 3 clinical trials in the country, eyed to start some time in January 2021.Galvez said the Philippines told Sinovac officials it would need 25 million doses for next year, and that “substantial meetings” were being held with its representatives to finalize a deal.Galvez said negotiations were also being facilitated by Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian, who emphasized to Chinese vaccine manufacturers that the countrywas “in dire need of vaccines during the first quarter” of 2021.Apart from Sinovac, the government was also in talks with Sinopharm and CanSino Bilogics for its COVID-19 vaccine.MUST READ

Prioritizing the Philippines
During the briefing, Philippine Ambassador to China Jose Santiago Santa Romana said China’s offer to prioritize the Philippines in its distribution of a vaccine “still stands,” and has been reiterated by President Xi Jinping, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and other Chinese officials in recent meetings.Regarding talks with Sinovac, Santa Romana said the company sought details on the Philippines’ process for procuring doses as well as its specific needs. Sinovac officials said the company was aiming to ramp up production to500 million doses within the next 12 months.“They are ready to supply but what is important is there are continuing talks…and so we hope the talks can advanced so the procurement and deployment can happen,” Santa Romana said.Santa Romana noted while initial talks were talking place, there was a need to finalize a deal as the Philippines was not the only priority country of China.“Other ASEAN countries are involved and there other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America,” he said.Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque downplayed concerns China would use its vaccines to put pressure on the Philippines on issues like the South China Sea. Roque said the possibility of such happening “is almost nil.”
Santa Romana acknowledged that while China may be offering access to a vaccine as part of its campaign to improve Beijing’s standing in the world, making it a condition in geopolitics has not come up in discussions.
“I think the Chinese are very clear that when it comes to the Philippines, we put it on separate tracks. Where we have differences, we discuss it but if you’re going to use to press on the other, that is certainly not going to work under this administration,” he said.MUST READ

Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez says the companies are willing to set aside 4 to 25 million doses of their respective vaccines
Two more pharmaceutical companies are interested in supplying the Philippines COVID-19 vaccine by the latter half of 2021, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said on Friday, December 18.Romualdez said US-based Moderna and Arcturus Therapeutics are willing to set aside between 4 to 25 million doses of their vaccines starting in the 3rd quarter of next year “should the Philippine government find their proposals willing.”
“We are hoping our government will consider the promising candidates of Moderna and Arcturus for inclusion in our country’s pool of anti-COVID vaccines,” he said.Moderna is already in the initial negotiation stages with the Philippine government for the possible purchase of its vaccines, while Arcturus has not yet been included in the country’s vaccine portfolio for either trials or procurement.More opportunities
Romualdez’s announcement provides the Philippines with an additional option for vaccines, on top of 22 other potential candidates.Rowena Guevara, Department of Science and Technology Undersecretary for research and development, said the government is interested in multiple vaccines to cover both the need to have different vaccine platforms and ensure adequate supply for the country.Guevara said different kinds of vaccines, such as those that use RNA, live attenuated, or vector vaccine platforms are needed to cater to different kinds of people who would receive the anti-COVID shot.“Right now we are more worried about the supply because if you look at the availability of these vaccines that are ready for 2021, it is not enough for the entire world population. We have to prioritize and to that effect, we need to make sure we can get as many vaccines as we can from all the types of platforms,"" she added.
A recent study published in the BMJ medical journal found that based on advance purchase commitments, high income countries already reserved over half of doses to be supplied by 13 leading manufacturers.“Even if all 13 of these vaccine manufacturers were to succeed in reaching their maximum production capacity, at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022,” it said. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Vaccines from American vaccine makers will likely start to arrive no later than June, says Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez
The 20 million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines could arrive in the Philippines as early as end of May or early June, according to Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez.
“We’re hoping that we will have the first deliveries by either end of May or early part of June. That's our target,” said Romualdez on Friday, March 5, during a Laging Handa virtual public briefing.
The Moderna doses will arrive in batches, added the Ambassador.
This timeline is earlier than the previously announced possible arrival of Moderna vaccines in the 3rd quarter of the year, the months of July to September.
The government, in partnership with the private sector, and financed by the World Bank, has signed an agreement with Moderna pharmaceutical firm to secure 20 million doses for the country which will be divided among private companies, national government, and local governments.
""Almost half of that will go to the private sector and their employees... and then the other half will go to our health workers and the rest of the Filipinos that will be receiving the Moderna through the LGUs and other entities in the Philippines,"" said the envoy.
Pfizer vaccines arriving in 'next couple of weeks'
Romualdez also gave updates on other vaccine deals that the country has with the COVAX Facility and other American pharmaceutical companies.
COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access or COVAX, is a global initiative whose objective is the equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Spearheading this effort are Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and others.
The 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines, secured through the COVAX Facility, will arrive in the ""next couple of weeks,"" said Romualdez.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had earlier said he was expecting the Pfizer doses to reach the Philippines sometime in the 2nd quarter of the year.
According to Romualdez, the US has doubled up its production of the vaccines as per President Joe Biden’s goal to vaccinate all Americans by the end of May.
Romualdez expected the vaccines from the US to start arriving no later than June of this year all the way down to the 3rd and 4th quarter of this year.
Johnson and Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) has also committed to provide 6 million doses to the Philippines but has yet to give a definite date of the delivery because of the production priority in America.
""It can't be that only one country is COVID-free. It should be the whole world and they are aware of that and the fact that they are backing the WHO (World Health Organization) and also contributing to the COVAX Facility will give access to most countries, especially the Philippines,"" said Romualdez in a mix of English and Filipino.
Galvez is set to fly to India on March 9 to secure another deal with an American vaccine-maker, Novavax, from which the Philippines expected 30 million doses.
Romualdez said the Philippines was not being left behind by other countries in terms of vaccination rollout.“It takes time but we’re not far behind as people think. We are not far behind from many countries. Truth be told, we’re actually better off than many countries because technically we’re only [in] the first week of March when we’ve already started our vaccination program,” said the Ambassador.
The Philippines is actually one of the last countries in Southeast Asia to receive vaccines and begin administering shots to its citizens. This despite it being the country with the second highest tally of COVID-19 cases in the region. – Rappler.com

'Now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,' says Filipino nurse May Parsons, who has been working with the UK's National Health Service for 24 years
A Filipino nurse in the UK administered the world’s first approved and fully tested COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, December 8, in what she described as a “historic day” showing “light at the end of the tunnel.”
Filipino nurse May Parsons delivered Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine to 90-year-old Margaret Keenan at a local hospital in Coventry. Keenan is the first person in world to get the vaccine, approved just a week ago in Britain.“I’m just glad that I’m able to play a part in this historic day,” Parsons said in a statement released by the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). “The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel.”
“I’m happy it’s happened and now I’ve done it and hopefully more people come along and do as I did, you know?” Keenan told CNN.The moment watched by the world was not lost on Parsons, who has worked with the NHS for 24 years.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she encouraged the public to avail of the vaccine.
""It's important that we're making this as popular as can be for everyone to take,"" Parsons said.
The UK is the first country in the world to mount a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19, with the elderly, vulnerable, and front line health workers among the first in line to receive the shot in the program.The historic moment, which came after an unprecedented worldwide sprint to produce a safe and effective vaccine, marked a milestone in the pandemic that has so far killed over 1.5 million people and sickened over 67 million.British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce described Keenan’s experience as a “fantastic moment” as he recognized Parson's service at the NHS.“A fantastic moment! And great to see that the vaccine is administered by Nurse May Parsons from the Philippines – one of the many thousands of Filipino healthcare workers making such an enormous contribution to the NHS,” Pruce tweeted.UK State Minister Nigel Adams said the country was “proud” to have dedicated health workers like Parsons.
Parsons is among the nearly 20,000 Filipinos who make up the staff of the NHS, UK's healthcare system. Filipinos rank third following British and Indian staff.Filipino nurses have been recognized worldwide for their contribution to foreign health systems across Europe, the Middle East, and North America, among others.
While many have been hailed for their dedication, their service on the front lines also means Filipino health workers have been one of the hardest-hit groups, suffering from high death rates during the pandemic.MUST READ

(UPDATED) Soldiers who do not want to avail of vaccines from the national stockpile would have to pay for it themselves
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) ordered all 150,000 of its soldiers and their dependents to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), AFP spokesman Major General Edgard Arevalo said in a press briefing on Thursday, February 25.
""Ang Sandatahang Lakas ng Pilipinas is not like any organization. Tayo po ay service-oriented organization. Tayo po ang inaasahan sa mararaming mabibigay na tungkulin tulad ng pagharap ng pandemya. Kaya hindi opsyon ang pag-ayaw,"" Arevalo said in an online briefing.
(The Armed Forces of the Philippines is not like any organization. We are a service-oriented organization. Many rely on us on numerous matters, including facing the pandemic. So, refusal is not an option.)
The AFP will subsidize their vaccination if the jabs are available from the national stockpile. The first batch of this will be the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines set to arrive on February 28. Some 100,000 doses were reserved for the military.
The military gets this big share from the first shipment despite being categorized as the 4th priority group for vaccinations, following frontline medical workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities.
If soldiers do not want to use the Sinovac vaccine, they would have to look for a vaccine and pay for it themselves. So far, this option is not possible as there are no commercially available vaccines in the country.
Asked if this means that soldiers have no choice but to take in the Sinovac vaccine, Arevalo said, ""That may be the case.""
On Thursday afternoon, however, the Department of Health announced the rollout of Sinovac was placed “on hold” as it has yet to get the recommendation and approval of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).
The AFP has an estimated 150,000 personnel. If they end up receiving 100,000 doses, that means 50,000 will get the required 2 doses. Arevalo said they will prioritize AFP members who are medical workers and frontliners.

'Wala pong pilian,' says Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque as the government announces that a Chinese vaccine could be the first to be rolled out to priority groups
Health workers, elderly, and indigent persons who refuse to be given the first COVID-19 vaccine to be offered to them by the government will lose their priority slot and wait for another vaccine along with the general population, said Malacañang on Monday, January 11.
The policy was explained by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque after news broke that a Chinese vaccine could be the first to be given to priority groups as early as February, if regulatory agencies approve.
Roque said that those who reject an offered vaccine will be asked to sign a waiver signifying their refusal to get the free jabs.
""Wala pong pilian, wala kasing pilitan. Pero magsa-sign ka ng waiver na hindi ka nagpaturok,"" he said during a Palace press briefing.
(No choosing, because there's no forcing. But you'll sign a waiver that you decided not to get vaccinated.)
""At kung mayroon kang prayoridad, siyempre, mawawala 'yung prayoridad mo, sasama ka sa the rest of the taumbayan na naghihintay ng bakuna,"" he continued.
(And if you're in the priority groups, of course, your priority slot would be gone, you would have to join the rest of the population waiting for a vaccine.)
Roque said this policy is ""only right"" because the government won't be able to choose which COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately available to the Philippines since this is partly dependent on supplies of vaccine developers.
""We all have rights to good health, but you can't choose because so many Filipinos need to be vaccinated,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
This vaccine policy has yet to be formalized in a task force resolution, but Roque said officials have reached a ""consensus"" on it.
Order of vaccines arrival
The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in the Philippines will likely be CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by Chinese firm Sinovac. An initial batch of 50,000 doses is expected to arrive in February, with batches arriving throughout the year until arrivals reach 25 million doses in December.
Because CoronaVac requires two doses, this amount is only good for 12.5 million Filipinos, roughly half of the 24.6 million Filipinos in the priority list of the government.
What could fill in the gap are the other vaccines the government is trying to secure but are set to arrive later in the year. The first batch of 30 million doses of Covovax, the vaccine of American firm Novavax, is expected to arrive around July to September. Around this time also, doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, secured by Philippine private firms and various local governments, are seen to arrive.
All of those vaccine rollouts will depend on the issuance of an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Without an EUA, none of the vaccines can be administered.
So far, only AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Russia's Gamaleya Institute – developer of the Sputnik V vaccine – have applied for an EUA.
Roque, however, said he expects Sinovac to submit its application in the next few days.
Trust in vaccines
Some Phase 3 trials of the Sinovac vaccine have shown an efficacy of 78%, a better rating than the AstraZeneca vaccine. But details from these trials remain unpublished at this time. (READ: [ANALYSIS] The Chinese COVID-19 vaccines, Sinopharm and Sinovac, are effective)
Since July, it's been used in China for vulnerable sectors. However, no stringent regulatory agency, like the World Health Organization, European Union, or United States agencies have approved this vaccine.
But countries where clinical trials were performed, like Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil, are expected to issue emergency use approval soon.
Roque said the government would wait for the Philippine FDA to issue an EUA before administering Sinovac's vaccine to Filipinos. If the doses arrive in February without an EUA, the government would accept the doses but keep them until an EUA is issued. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo says company officials claimed they already had enough data for their candidate vaccine
COVID-19 vaccine developer AstraZeneca has withdrawn its application to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed on Friday, December 11.“They said they already have enough data,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said in a message to Rappler.Asked when the company stopped its application, Domingo said his staff informed of him of the development today.
AstraZeneca’s decision to withdraw its application comes just days after it secured the endorsement of the Philippines’ research ethics board, one of the requirements needed to conduct trials in the country. Last December 4, Dr Nina Gloriani, head of the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel, said the group was waiting for the company to respond to its comments before it decided whether to endorse its application to the FDA.
AstraZeneca, which developed its vaccine with the University of Oxford, became the first COVID-19 vaccine candidate to have efficacy results from phase 3 trials published in peer-reviewed journal The Lancet. Its study published earlier this week confirmed initial trial data that showed their vaccine was 70% effective in protecting against symptomatic COVID-19.
While the company pulled out is application, Domingo earlier said conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines is not a prerequisite for a vaccine to be registered for use in the country.The Philippines has so far secured from the company an initial 2.6 million doses for about 1.5 million Filipinos through an agreement with the Philippine government and private sector.The doses will be split in half between the government and businesses that chipped in for the P700-million deal.On top of this, Galvez said the firm would be setting aside 20 million doses for the Philippines, each priced at “more or less $5.”

Initial doses of Pfizer and Sinovac vaccines may arrive as early as February, when the Duterte government plans to start its mass immunization campaign against COVID-19
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said COVID-19 vaccines developed by United States drugmaker Pfizer, China's Sinovac, and the United Kingdom's AstraZeneca may be among the first to arrive in the Philippines.
Galvez identified the 3 vaccines based on the current status of negotiations that the government is holding with pharmaceutical companies and multilateral initiatives, including international group GAVI's COVAX facility.
The COVAX facility guarantees access to a portfolio of vaccines and doses for at least 20% of the population of participating countries. It is run by GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and the World Health Organization (WHO).
""The 3 vaccines that will arrive first either way – if we can negotiate an early rollout – first, Pfizer, second, Sinovac, and then AstraZeneca,"" Galvez said in a virtual briefing on Wednesday, January 13.He earlier announced that the Duterte government could begin distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the public as soon as February, when the first doses of either Sinovac or Pfizer's vaccine arrive.

If the Philippines is among the countries where doses would be delivered, supplies may come as soon as February, WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said.
In the Philippines, Pfizer has applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is expected to announce its decision this week.Sinovac earlier told Philippine officials that an initial delivery of at least 50,000 doses could be delivered in February, though this would still depend on whether the company secures emergency approval from the FDA.
Galvez said the company is expected to submit an application for EUA within the next few days after it consolidates findings from Phase 3 clinical trials in Turkey and Brazil.

Best price for Filipinos?
During the briefing, Galvez also defended the government's negotiations after lawmakers questioned why Sinovac is among the vaccine brands favored for procurement despite its reportedly higher price compared to other brands.
Galvez said that during negotiations, price points being offered were much lower than market prices which are publicly available. He declined to divulge Sinovac's exact price as talks with the company are bound by confidentiality agreements until a deal is finalized.Instead, Galvez described Sinovac's price to be midrange, supposedly cheaper than those being offered by American pharmaceutical firms.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also sought to assure the public that the government would not enter into deals disadvantageous to Filipinos.
""We won't enter into negotiations where the government will be shortchanged. As we've said, we have a portfolio of vaccines we are looking at and we're not considering just one vaccine,"" she said in Filipino.The Philippines has so far signed deals to purchase at least 30 to 40 million doses of Novavax's vaccine, which are expected to arrive in the 3rd quarter of 2021.

Term sheets allow for vaccine companies to lock in supplies and start preparations for logistical needs to manufacture and deliver doses, Galvez said.
A final supply deal still needs to be signed to secure the exact price and number of doses, while securing emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will likewise be necessary for any vaccine to be used in the Philippines.
Only Pfizer has so far secured an EUA in the country, while AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, and Sinovac have submitted applications for this requirement.

Why it matters
If the Philippines can lock in at least 20 million doses of Moderna's vaccine, secured vaccine supplies for the Philippines may increase to about 92 million doses, making it possible for the government to reach the low end of its target to vaccinate at least 50 million Filipinos.Galvez earlier mentioned that port magnate Enrique Razon Jr expressed willingness to help secure doses of Moderna's vaccine for Filipinos.

Moderna's vaccine is compatible with the Department of Health's current cold storage capabilities since it can remain stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F) for 30 days, and up to 6 months at standard freezer temperatures of -20°C (-4°F). – Rappler.com",Rappler

(3rd UPDATE) The private sector is still looking for more manufacturers to boost the Philippines' vaccine stockpile
Over 30 business leaders inked a deal with the Philippine government for 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, worth around P700 million, on Friday, November 27.
Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion led the signing ceremony, along with vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr and Lotis Ramin, country president of AstraZeneca Philippines.
Half of the vaccines, expected to arrive around the 2nd quarter of 2021, will be donated to the government, while the other half will be for employees in the private sector.

Key to this agreement were the efforts of the embassy of the United Kingdom led by Ambassador Daniel Pruce. Galvez has been saying for days that he had been in talks with the embassy on vaccine supply.
Concepcion also attributed the deal's success to SM's Tessie Sy-Coson and BDO president and chief executive officer Nestor Tan.
He noted that Coson and Tan helped reach out to AstraZeneca. Concepcion likewise called several business leaders while the talks were ongoing.
""Two weeks of calling, I sound like a beggar calling for everybody. But it turned around and we have a lot of support from the private sector,"" Concepcion said.
He added that the private sector is looking for more sources of the vaccine aside from AstraZeneca, as the 2.6 million vaccines can only benefit up to 1.5 million people.
The vaccine is expected to cost around P500 or $10 for two doses.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is being developed with Oxford University in the UK.
The pharmaceutical firm has reported its vaccine is 70% effective against COVID-19. But experts have raised doubts after finding out that the second group of participants in the AstraZeneca trials were limited to people aged 55 and below, an age group with a lower risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.
But it’s still a long way to go before the 2.6 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses are actually distributed to Filipinos.The vaccine will still have to pass the UK's regulatory process and get approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration. This critical approval could come as early as May to July 2021 or late next year, said Galvez.
Half to private sector
Christian Gonzalez of the Enrique Razon Jr-led International Container Terminals Services Incorporated (ICTSI), one of the private companies making the donation, said the ""vast majority"" of initial vaccine recipients will be ""government employees, frontline health workers, and other essential services workers"" as designated by the Department of Health.
ICTSI will use its share of the vaccine supply for its employees and those of the entire Razon Group, said Gonzalez.
But the firm will also devote some of its doses to employees of the Philippine Ports Authority, Bureau of Customs, and other essential port and logistics workers – frontliners who ""made the biggest impact, especially at the beginning of the pandemic,"" said Gonzalez.
The private sector has played a big role in the Philippines' pandemic response. From donations of various goods, to testing employees and poor households, conglomerates have stepped in, as the government has drawn flak for how it is handling the crisis.
'Affordable'
Galvez told President Rodrigo Duterte that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is the most affordable vaccine among those being negotiated for by the government, priced at around $5 per dose.
""At nakita natin ang AstraZeneca po maganda po dahil kasi non-profit po ang sa kanya at saka pinakamababa po ‘yung kanyang presyo, more or less $5 lang po,"" the vaccine czar said during the November 23 meeting.
(We can see that AstraZeneca is good because it's non-profit and it has the lowest price, more or less $5 only.)
Galvez praised AstraZeneca and the UK embassy for their ""goal of providing equitable access"" to the vaccine to developing countries like the Philippines.
Apart from AstraZeneca, Galvez has spoken of securing ""20 to 50 million doses"" of China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.
The Philippines aims to inoculate 60 million to 70 million Filipinos within 3 to 5 years. Some 35 million will belong to the first batch of recipients, a mix of poor households, healthcare workers, and frontline personnel.
To purchase these vaccines, the government is targeting a budget of P73.2 billion. Galvez is batting for a P150-billion fund in the 2021 national budget to shoulder expenses for a cold chain storage system necessary to distributing the vaccines. – Rappler.com",Rappler

'Once we have an emergency use authorization mechanism in place, the process will be faster,' says FDA Director General Eric Domingo
With President Rodrigo Duterte set to issue an emergency use authorization or EUA, coronavirus vaccines could arrive in the country before the second quarter of 2021.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo said during a virtual press briefing on Friday, November 20, that the EUA would hasten the government vaccine procurement plan.
In his reply to queries about the effect of an EUA, Doming said: ""Once we have an EUA mechanism in place. Once nakakuha na sila ng (they have the) EUA , for example in the US FDA, mas mapapabilis talaga ang proseso (the process will quicken). We’re able to look at the evaluation that are done by these mature and advanced regulatory agencies,"" Domingo said.
Malacañang said on Thursday, November 19, that Duterte already approved ""in principle"" the request of the health department for an EUA.
An EUA would speed up the processing time for approval of COVID-19 vaccines that would enter the country – from 6 months to 21 days.
It would be an order from the President to create an express lane that would skip the usual red tape and load of paperwork which bog down vaccine purchases.
Earlier, DOH assured the public that fast-tracking would not mean compromising on quality studies.
""We have the vaccine expert panel at the start, and the FDA would continuously monitor this technology kahit nabigyan na nila ng rehistro sa ating bansa (even though they are already registered in our country),"" said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a previous briefing.
In September, the FDA said that in a ""best case scenario,"" the earliest possible availability of a coronavirus vaccine in the Philippines would be by April 2021.
On Tuesday, November 17, Pfizer's Albert Bourla said that they were ""very close"" to applying for an emergency use approval for its COVID-19 vaccine after collecting safety data to submit to US regulators.
Moderna has previously said it expects to apply for an EUA by November 25.
The Philippines is currently looking at 17 possible sources of vaccines from various countries. Out of the 17, 9 are now undergoing the 3rd phase of trials, with Pfizer and Moderna reporting promising results, both with 95% efficacy in their phase 3 clinical trials results.

Malacañang says President Rodrigo Duterte is the 'best communication tool' to convince many Filipinos to get vaccinated
Malacañang said Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is willing to go first in line for a COVID-19 vaccine once it is approved for domestic use by the country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in order to convince more Filipinos to get immunized.
""Kung papayagan na po ng FDA, I think po mauuna ang Presidente and nag-volunteer naman po siya. In fact, gustong-gusto na niya,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Monday, December 7, during a press briefing.
(If the FDA will approve, I think the President would go first and he already volunteered. In fact, he really wants it.)
Roque called Duterte the ""best communication tool"" to convince more Filipinos to get vaccinated against COVID-19, amid fears of vaccination programs that grew partly because of the Dengvaxia controversy in 2017.
""Ang Presidente po, naku, hindi na makahintay. Gusto niyang talagang turukan na siya na mapakita sa buong bayan na ligtas at epektibo, ito po’y dumaan sa expert panel group ng pinakadalubhasang Pilipino,"" said the spokesman.
(The President can't wait. He really wants to get vaccinated to show the country that it is safe and effective, it went through a panel composed of Filipino experts.)
In August, Duterte said he was willing to get vaccinated, in public, against SARS-CoV-2 using the Russian-developed Sputnik V.
The FDA has yet to issue Emergency Use Approval (EUA) for any COVID-19 vaccine. But its director general, Eric Domingo, said the process could be as fast as 21 days once a vaccine manufacturer gets an EUA from its home country and submits complete data to the Philippine government.
Domingo's best-case scenario would be a Philippine EUA in January, which could mean distribution starting in March given the capacity of vaccine manufacturers to churn out doses for all the countries which reserved supply.
In the meantime, the national coronavirus task force has determined the 25 million Filipinos who will get vaccinated first. The list is led by medical frontliners and indigent senior citizens.

'VIP treatment'
Roque said the Palace ""welcomes"" the willingness of any other public official to get vaccinated upon issuance of an EUA. But the spokesman also expects criticism should government leaders get access to the vaccines first.
""It's a personal decision of our leaders but if that happens, the government will again be accused of prioritizing VIPs like what happened with the PCR test,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
Back in March, the early days of the pandemic, the Department of Health was criticized for supposedly prioritizing the early release of COVID-19 test results of senators, their spouses, celebrities, and other VIPs.

The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday, January 31, welcomed the offer of the country's group of Catholic bishops to help in the coronavirus vaccination drive of the government, which is struggling to persuade many Filipinos to get the shots.
The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) has offered to transform church facilities in the country into COVID-19 vaccination sites, and said its members were also willing to get vaccinated in public to help build confidence in the campaign.
""We are happy with the CBCP's offer,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a statement. ""Churches really can be alternative sites to areas that lack facility, especially those in hard-to-reach municipalities.""
The health department has acknowledged they face an uphill struggle to persuade many people to take the vaccine shots, on top of the logistical difficulties in reaching 2,000 inhabited islands with precarious health systems.
""We can offer our church facilities to help in this massive and complicated and very challenging program of vaccination,"" Archbishop Romulo Valles, CBCP president said on Thursday, January 28.

The Philippines is set to receive its first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine from the Gavi vaccine alliance COVAX facility within the first quarter of 2021, Duterte government pandemic officials confirmed on Wednesday night, January 20.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III made the announcement in a joint statement, saying the Philippines received confirmation it would be among the countries included in the COVAX distribution of vaccines for an early rollout.“The Philippines today received the country’s confirmation of participation in the COVID-19 vaccine financing instrument, COVAX Facility - Advance Market Commitment (AMC),” the officials said. “With the country’s participation in the COVAX Facility, the country is set to receive vaccines in the first quarter of this year.”The decision came after Galvez said the government would submit an appeal to COVAX to have the Philippines included among countries that will be given a share of doses for possible delivery eyed in February.MUST READ

Preparations underway
On Wednesday, Duque and Galvez inspected public and private cold chain facilities to be used for the Duterte government’s COVID-10 vaccine program scheduled to start in February.“All of these preparations that we are undertaking are aimed at ensuring that the country is ready to receive, store, and mobilize the COVID-19 vaccines that will come from the COVAX Facility,” Duque said.(READ: EXPLAINERS: What to expect once COVID-19 vaccines arrive in the Philippines | How COVID-19 vaccines will get from warehouses to you)

Initial doses of the vaccines are expected to arrive as early as the 3rd quarter of 2021
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said that the government has signed two more agreements with pharmaceutical firms to secure at least 25 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines for Filipinos.Galvez gave the update during a virtual press briefing on Wednesday, February 17, as he flashed figures of vaccines eyed by the Philippine government for delivery in 2021. Among new agreements signed included those with Moderna for 20 million doses of its vaccine and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica) for 5 million doses of its single-dose coronavirus shot.Galvez’s presentation indicated that term sheets with the American pharmaceutical firms had been signed and that these companies have committed to supply doses to the Philippines. Term sheets are the second to the last step in vaccine negotiations and were necessary for locking in logistics needed for production and delivery.Initial doses of Moderna and Johnson and Johnson’s vaccines were expected to arrive in the Philippines as early as the 3rd quarter of 2021, with additional supply slated for delivery in the 4th quarter.While the deals assure Filipinos access to limited global supply, a supply agreement will still need to be signed with these companies to facilitate actual purchase and payment, as well as set a definite date for delivery.
Both Moderna and Johnson and Johnson will also need to secure emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before it could be rolled out to the public.So far, the FDA has granted emergency use approval for Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s vaccine, though FDA Director General Eric Domingo said Moderna has expressed interest in applying for an EUA.
Johnson & Johnson is expected to start Phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine in the Philippines in the coming weeks, after the FDA approved its application to hold late-stage trials in the country.SCREENSHOT FROM RTVM
Why it matters
With term sheets signed with Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, Galvez said the government has secured enough doses needed to vaccinate at least 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year.Aside from the two companies, the Philippines is also eyeing to purchase 25 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, while a tripartite agreement is being considered for 10 to 15 million doses of Gamaleya’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine.Prior to this, term sheets had been signed to secure 30 million doses of Novavax’ vaccine, 17 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, and 25 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine.On top of this, the Philippines is also expecting up to 44 million doses from the COVAX global facility.MUST READ
TIMELINE: The Philippines’ 2021 COVID-19 vaccine plan
Galvez earlier said the government is targeting to start the rollout of vaccines by February, though the lack of an indemnification program in the country has hindered the delivery of an initial 117,000 Pfizer vaccines from COVAX. Government lawyers have signed an indemnification agreement with the global vaccine facility to facilitate the delivery of vaccines which could be expected in the coming week, he added.Once vaccines arrive, health officials plan to vaccinate some 2 to 3 million people per week to reach its target of inoculating at least 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of 2021.The Philippines’ total vaccine orders are pegged at about 178 million, largely in anticipation of delays and other complications in scarce global supply. – Rappler.com

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire says that for now, they only have an 'indicative' schedule of the arrival of the vaccine doses
The Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday, February 10, that there is ""no confirmed date"" yet on the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines as the country prepares for its vaccination program.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing that what Gavi vaccine alliance COVAX facility told them was an ""indicative date"" or tentative schedule, which is the 2nd or 3rd week of February.
""The February 15 is an indicative date, when we say indicative date that is tentative schedule. No confirmed date yet on when are we going to start,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Vergeire issued the statement when asked about the arrival of the vaccines in the country so as not to give ""false hopes"" to Filipinos. She added that they will give the exact date of the start of the vaccination program once they get the confirmation of the vaccine arrival.
This comes after Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the government would be ready to start its vaccination program by February 15. He later clarified though that start of vaccination will still depend on the arrival of the vaccines from the COVAX facility.
Though they could not give the exact date of the vaccination program, the government – led by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez – on Tuesday held a simulation exercise of the vaccine arrival in the country, including the pickup of the vaccine supplies from the airport.Vergeire said the simulation was done to avoid vaccine wastage.
Meanwhile, the DOH said on Monday that that all vaccine operation centers in local government units located in Metro Manila, Central Visayas, and Davao should be fully activated by February 10.– Rappler.com

'Instead of aiming at the hoop, he scratched his balls so he dropped the ball even as time was running out,' says Senator Panfilo Lacson in a cryptic tweet
The Philippines would have been in line to receive 10 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in January 2021, if Health Secretary Francisco Duque III had not “dropped the ball” on an arrangement passed onto him by other officials, said Senator Panfilo Lacson.
In a cryptic tweet on Thursday, December 17, Lacson shared what he called a “direct quote.”
“In July, we passed the ball to him. Instead of aiming at the hoop, he scratched his balls so he dropped the ball even as time was running out. Then, Singapore grabbed and shot the ball,” Lacson said.
The senator then capped off his tweet, “Now, they have the vaccines and we don’t.”
Rappler asked Lacson to clarify whom he was quoting in his tweet, but he has yet to reply to our query as of this posting.
However, the previous night, he sent reporters a message in which he mentioned Duque in relation to an earlier tweet by Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, who said someone had “dropped the ball” in making arrangements with Pfizer for the vaccines.

Locsin shares foiled plan to secure 10M Pfizer vaccine doses by January
Citing a phone conversation he had with Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, Lacson said Locsin and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were already negotiating “as early as July,” as arranged by Romualdez.
“Thus, they could have secured the delivery of 10 million Pfizer vaccines as early as January next year, way ahead of Singapore, but for the indifference of Secretary Duque, who failed to work on the necessary documentary requirement namely, the Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA) as he should have done,” Lacson said.
Even Pfizer’s country representative had been following up on the CDA but to no avail, he added.
Lacson then lamented how many lives will have been saved if the Pfizer vaccines were made available to Filipinos by January 2021. Although Duque claimed ongoing talks between the pharmaceutical company and the government, Lacson said the Philippines already missed what would have been the early first salvo of deliveries of the vaccines.
If it is true that Duque “dropped the ball” in arrangements for the Pfizer vaccine, then he may be sued for “gross and inexcusable negligence under the anti-graft law,” said Senator Francis Pangilinan on Thursday.
The Senate Committee of the Whole is set to hold a legislative inquiry into the government’s plans on rolling out COVID-19 vaccines. Pangilinan said this will be crucial not only in checking the readiness of those plans, but also in ferreting out any attempts at overpricing.
“Millions of lives are at stake here,” Pangilinan said.
Duque on Wednesday denied he had been negligent in the matter, and said negotiations with Pfizer for the vaccines are still underway.
Peace Process Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr, the country’s COVID-19 vaccine czar and chief implementer of policies on the pandemic, earlier said Pfizer's vaccine may arrive in the Philippines by the 3rd quarter of 2021 at the earliest, along with the bulk of other vaccines eyed by the government.

The first batch of Sinovac vaccines is scheduled to arrive in the Philippines on Sunday, February 28, announced Malacañang.
""We expect that the delivery will arrive on Sunday,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in Filipino on Thursday, February 25.
These vaccines will be the Philippines' very first batch of COVID-19 jabs. The country lags behind some of its Southeast Asian neighbors like Indonesia and Malaysia, who have kickstarted their vaccination drives.
Government officials will be physically welcoming the arrival of the much-awaited vaccines, added Roque.
A Sinovac executive, general manager Helen Yang, previously said that the first delivery involves 600,000 doses, all of which are donated. They will arrive all together in a military plane. Of this, 100,000 have been reserved for the military.
President Rodrigo Duterte had wanted to be present in the welcoming ceremony for the vaccines but his attendance is not yet confirmed.
In a statement posted on Facebook, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said the delivery of the Philippines' first COVID-19 doses is a testament to the “profound friendship and partnership” between Manila and Beijing.
“It is a fine tradition between China and the Philippines to help each other in trying times. A friend in need is a friend indeed.... I hope the vaccines will help kick off Philippines’ mass inoculation campaign to curb the pandemic and allow Filipinos’ life to return to normal at the earliest,” Huang said.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had previously said it would take ""2 to 3 days"" after the arrival of vaccines for the government to administer the first doses to priority Filipinos.
CoronaVac, Sinovac's vaccine, was approved for emergency use just last Monday, February 22, but government experts do not recommend its use for health workers, which had been identified as the first priority of the vaccination program.
But government experts are still in deliberations to finalize the guidelines for CoronaVac. Malacañang has said health workers can still get the Sinovac vaccine if they wanted because the Food and Drug Administration only recommends against it but does not prohibit such use.

At least 5.6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from two pharmaceutical companies are expected to arrive in the Philippines within the 1st quarter of 2021 through the global initiative COVAX.
These will ""jump-start the country's national vaccination program as part of the global efforts to stop the spread of [the] coronavirus,"" said vaccine czar and National Task Force Against COVID-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr in a statement on Sunday, January 31.
The COVAX Facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), will provide 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. ""These are expected to be delivered in mid-February and will cover the 1st quarter supply commitment,"" Galvez added.
The country will also receive 5,500,800 to 9,290,400 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. AstraZeneca is still waiting for emergency use listing from the WHO.
""The 'indicative' numbers of [AstraZeneca] doses reflect only the supply for the first two quarters of 2021. The initial delivery is scheduled by mid to late February as stated in the letter,"" Galvez said.
Aurélia Nguyen, managing director of the COVAX Facility, informed the Philippine government about these in a letter.
The government had received confirmation on January 20 that it would be among the countries included in the COVAX distribution of vaccines for an early rollout.
Galvez then noted that according to COVAX, ""the number of doses and the projected arrival of the vaccines are all indicative since it all depends on the global supply.""
""The vaccines under COVAX can now inoculate our healthcare workers, medical-related personnel, and other frontliners,"" he said.
The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration. (READ: EXPLAINERS: What to expect once COVID-19 vaccines arrive in the Philippines | How COVID-19 vaccines will get from warehouses to you)

""We hope that these kinds of preparations will be replicated nationwide,"" added Galvez.

Talks are also ongoing with microfinance institutions in order to revive the assistance to small to medium businesses
Over 200 Philippine companies have ""expressed their pledge and interest"" in buying doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British company AstraZeneca, according to Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion.
""This only means that the business community is very serious in ensuring that our economy will remain open while slowly ending this war,"" Concepcion said in a recent statement, adding that ""more than 200 companies already expressed their pledge and interest, and still counting.""
Concepcion said among them were:
Ayala Corporation - 400,000 doses
Palawan Pawnshop - 100,000 doses
Okada Manila - 40,000 doses
Uratex Philippines - 21,000 doses
Century Pacific Food - 20,000 doses
Unioil Petroleum Philippines, Inc - 20,000 doses
Golden Arches Development Corporation - 15,000 doses
Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. - 10,000 doses
Vaccination of each person takes two doses. Each dose of AstraZeneca is still at its base cost of $5, said Concepcion, or around P241.50.
In a first batch in November, over 30 business leaders signed a deal with the Philippine government for 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine worth around P700 million.
In that deal, half of the vaccines will be donated to the government and half will be for employees of the private sector. The vaccines of that first procurement are expected to arrive around the 2nd quarter of 2021.
AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University in the United Kingdom, reports a 70% effectivity rate against COVID-19.However, experts have raised doubts with the vaccine because the second group of participants in the clinical trial were aged 55 and below, an age range said to be of lower risk to developing severe coronavirus symptoms.Concepcion said that they have been in talks with microfinance institutions (MFIs) to kickstart plans on procuring vaccine doses as well, in order to revive MFIs. Helping MFIs will revive the assistance to Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises or MSMEs.
""The more businesses involved in this project, the faster the ecosystem will be revived, thus, stimulating exchange. It is one answer to the question of how we get money flowing again – it will stop the bleeding,"" said Concepcion.
Concepcion said the private sector's effort is a complement to the government's effort.
""If the private sector will not help, the economy will remain restricted,"" said Concepcion.
The Duterte government has been under scrutiny for a slow-paced process in getting the Pfizer vaccine, with Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr saying ""somebody dropped the ball,"" alluding to embattled Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.

(UPDATED) The interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group says health workers can still opt not to get the Sinovac vaccine
The Department of Health's (DOH) advisory group has approved the use of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine for Philippine healthcare workers but said those who prefer another brand would not be penalized.
The interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) made the announcement in a virtual press briefing hosted by the DOH on Friday afternoon, February 26.
""Really, the Sinovac vaccine that we evaluated is safe for use for healthcare workers. We need to protect them. And since ito ang available ngayon e kailangan nating gamitin (this is what is available now, we need to use it),"" said Dr Maria Consorcia Quizon of NITAG.
Dr Edsel Salvana of the DOH technical advisory group (TAG) said that based on NITAG's studies, Sinovac's CoronaVac ""looks like it will save lives and so it is but right to offer to the people on the frontlines who have been saving lives.""
""If they don't think this is the right vaccine for them, we will not penalize them,"" Salvana added.
'Safe' to offer to health workers
Dr Ana Ong -Lim, also a member of TAG, said that the first batch of the vaccines that would arrive in the country would need to be allocated rationally because vaccine resource is ""very scarce.""
""After much deliberation, nakapagkasundaan ng NITAG at TAG na sulit pa rin na ito ayi-alok sa ating heath workers at mabigyan sila ng pagkakataon based on their own understanding sa mga ibibigay nating information kung gusto nila itong tanggapin or hindi,"" she said.
(After much deliberation, NITAG and TAG have agreed that these vaccine is still worth offering to our health workers and to give them the option to decide for themselves whether to accept it or not, based on their own understanding of the information that we will give them.)
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that they are still finalizing the list of hospitals that would receive the first batch of the vaccines but the ones to be prioritized are healthcare workers in COVID-19 dedicated hospitals.
The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and the Lung Center of the Philippines are among the known COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in the country.
On Friday, healthcare workers at PGH demanded free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines.
Malacañang welcomed the development. ""The Sinovac vaccine is expected to arrive on Sunday, February 28, and we are confident that many of our healthcare workers would get themselves inoculated to boost public confidence in our mass vaccination program against the coronavirus,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.
Sinovac’s CoronaVac will be the first batch of vaccines to arrive in the Philippines.
The Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Sinovac emergency use authorization but recommended against administering it to health workers with high exposure to the disease.FDA Director General Eric Domingo said its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The agency instead recommended its use to people aged 18 to 59 after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.

Many could not help but compare the speed by which cities signed deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca against the fact that the national government itself had yet to enter into any agreement. (LIST: Local governments' plans for COVID-19 vaccines)
""Many local government units opted to go on their own. They buy, because they have the money, and they chose their own vaccine,"" acknowledged President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 13.
Before cities began signing their vaccine deals, the only other signed agreement to secure doses was initiated and financially backed by private corporations like Udenna Corporation, Aboitiz Foundation, BDO Foundation, and others.Though all these agreements could not have been signed without the participation of the national government, it was the efforts of mayors and corporate executives that catalyzed and quickly shepherded the process.
How did the mayors of several cities in Metro Manila and across the country secure these agreements? What can other mayors or governors learn from their experience?
Rappler reporters spoke with the following local officials to find out:
Mayor Rex Gatchalian of Valenzuela City
Mayor Francis Zamora of San Juan City
Mayor Joy Belmonte of Quezon City and Joseph Juico, co-chairperson of Quezon City's vaccine task force
Mayor Sara Duterte of Davao City
How their efforts began
Deals were finalized and signed in early January, but most mayors began initial efforts to scout for a vaccine supplier months before.
Mayor Duterte said she began sending unsolicited letters to various vaccine makers in October 2020.
Around this time, Quezon City had also begun scouting around, according to Juico. By late November, Quezon City had begun talks with vaccine developers and had asked national government agencies on how they could proceed, Mayor Belmonte said.
In these months, mayors were walking blind, with the national government not having cascaded any clear plan on coordination for vaccine procurement.
It was only in early November when vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr publicly presented an initial National Vaccine Roadmap, where the only mentioned involvement of the local governments would be in identifying recipients, distributing vaccines, and rolling out information campaigns.
But, by the end of that month, private firms managed to ink a deal with AstraZeneca for 3 million doses. The national government was part of the deal since AstraZeneca had told corporation executives it needed the government involved.It was also in November when firms like Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute began announcing efficacy rates from Phase III trials of their vaccines, creating excitement and then clamor from the public. A 70% efficacy rating was found for AstraZeneca’s vaccine in a study published on December 8.
So, without the national government’s hand, mayors moved independently to contact vaccine makers. Belmonte got a number of an AstraZeneca executive from private doctors. Mayor Duterte, in an October meeting with the British embassy on another matter, discussed vaccines and was told to write to AstraZeneca for access, a suggestion she took.
Duterte had also asked officials at the Chinese consulate in Davao City “for options,” which led them to put her in touch with Sinovac. In the same way, a United States embassy official sent her an email, asking if they could help the city, and she responded. The embassy then endorsed a meeting with US firm Johnson & Johnson, whose pharmaceutical company, Janssen, is slated to conduct vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines.
Matters speed up in January
As of late November and early December, mayors like Belmonte and Valenzuela’s Gatchalian had still been hesitant to sign anything solid or make any orders with vaccine firms.
For Belmonte, this was because they didn’t think it wise to finalize an order without the guidance of the Food and Drug Administration, the agency that would identify which vaccines could be administered and distributed in the country.
San Juan’s Zamora said he also wanted to keep their options open for the possibility of sourcing vaccines from other providers. He said he did not want to “over-order” either, as they anticipated the national government to allocate vaccines for them.
It was in early December when Galvez had meetings with Metro Manila mayors where he explained the national government’s vaccine plans.
According to Zamora, Galvez had given local government units (LGUs) the go signal to procure vaccines on their own as long as mayors would coordinate with the national government.
But, in Davao City, Mayor Sara, the President’s daughter, had not yet heard of any vaccine coordination plan from the national government.
On December 10, she said the national government should let LGUs access vaccine deals on their own.
“In my opinion, if they allow LGUs to move on their own to access vaccines approved by the national government, then the LGUs may be able to help the national government move the vaccines to a large segment of the population,” she said over Davao City Disaster Radio.

It was on December 15 when Quezon City was able to get in touch with AstraZeneca officials. The firm sent them the next day a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which was reviewed by the city’s legal department then sent back to AstraZeneca on December 17, said Juico.
A few days before Christmas, December 22, city hall and AstraZeneca officials sat down for a meeting to discuss the vaccine.
After a lull due to the holidays, the United Kingdom regulatory agency (Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) announced its emergency use approval for AstraZeneca’s vaccine on December 30.
When Juico called up AstraZeneca after the news, he was told things would have to move faster.
“That’s when they said we have to move quickly because it’s approved by the UK and they need to talk with Mayor because a certain number of doses is available for allocation for QC,” Juico said.
Belmonte swung into action, calling up Galvez on January 1 to get clearance from the national government.
“Secretary Galvez acted quickly. On the same day, he texted the parameters and then called Mayor to say the President has already agreed that LGUs can enter into tripartite agreements as long as national government takes the lead,” said Juico.
Valenzuela City and San Juan City had a similar experience, though they had reached out to AstraZeneca weeks after Quezon City.
From a wait-and-see stance in early December, things moved quickly once the cities had contacted AstraZeneca on the first week of January. The entire process, from first contact to signing of an agreement, took just one week, according to Zamora and Gatchalian.
What Gatchalian found helpful was how efficient AstraZeneca was, the guidance from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, and the framework provided by the tripartite agreement.
Another reason why deals with AstraZeneca pushed through faster than the rest was because the firm had agreed to the tripartite agreement model with national government.
This type of agreement has proven crucial to locking in vaccine doses because it entails an assurance of payment and orders that the national government has been hesitant to make due to procurement laws.
For LGUs, engaging in a tripartite agreement also assures them that the deals they are signing comply with the national government’s guidelines, which have not been clear.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque had said this about the first such tripartite deal, the one with private corporations. He said it was one way to reserve vaccines without fear of violating procurement regulations since it was another entity promising to pay for the supply.
The other work-around devised by Galvez was to use funding from the Asian Development Bank for advance orders since procurement laws don’t cover international aid. But for this funding to be released, the ADB requires that the vaccine to be procured must have approval from a mature regulatory agency.
What local governments commit to do in vaccine deals
According to the tripartite agreements, the local governments will take charge of the vaccines they order – from payment to administering doses to their citizens.
“They will buy, they will pay, they will pay for all the expenses, including delivery of vaccines, and they will also vaccinate their constituents in accordance with the National Vaccination Plan,” said Roque in a press briefing on Tuesday, January 12.
Roque had bared provisions in the agreements entered into by cities, AstraZeneca, and the national government during the briefing. One of these provisions says payments of local governments need not pass through the national government, but will go straight to AstraZeneca.
Local governments are also in charge of paying for and coordinating the delivery of the vaccines to their areas.
This level of involvement of local governments was nowhere to be found in Galvez’s initial November 3 vaccine plan.
It was later on, absent more concrete moves from the national government, when mayors “offered” this level of involvement.
“It was the LGUs who offered their help to the NTF (National Task Force), the national government, to buy vaccines for their constituents,” said Roque.
In meetings with Metro Manila mayors, Galvez had expressed gratitude to the local chiefs for their initiative.
How about LGUs without resources to secure vaccine doses?
The mayors of Metro Manila and other highly-urbanized cities like Davao City, Bacolod City, and Antipolo City have big budgets. Davao City is even led by the President’s daughter. But what of smaller or less influential cities or provinces?
Malacañang has given assurances that they won’t be left behind.
“No! Because the national government, the NTF, is prepared to buy for everyone,” said Roque in Filipino.
Finally, on Monday, January 11, the national government signed an agreement with US firm Novavax for 30 million doses of its vaccine. Soon after, it also signed a deal with China’s Sinovac for 25 million doses.
Yet all these agreements – whether signed by the national government, cities, or private firms – are hinged on the all-important emergency use approval by the FDA. Without this approval, the agreements can’t be implemented. So far, only the Pfizer vaccine has been granted emergency use approval.
In the coming months, all eyes will be on how well the Duterte administration coordinates with mayors and governors to ensure an efficient and equitable vaccine roll-out. – with reports from Rambo Talabong and Jodesz Gavilan/Rappler.com",Rappler

Only 19% of Filipinos say they are willing to have themselves vaccinated
While the Philippines awaits the arrival of coronavirus vaccines necessary to tame the pandemic, a survey of the Octa Research Group showed a great number of Filipinos are still unwilling to have themselves vaccinated against the disease.The survey, conducted from January 26 to February 1, 2021, showed that if a safe and effective vaccine were available during the polling period, the greatest number of respondents at 46% said, “I will not have myself vaccinated.”The survey released on Wednesday night, February 24, also found that only 19% of respondents said they would have themselves vaccinated, while 35% said ""can't say"" if they will have themselves vaccinated.The Octa team based findings on face-to-face interviews with 1,200 Filipinos aged 18 years old and above. It has a 95% confidence level with a ±3% margin of error.Safety top concern
Among those unwilling to get vaccinated, the survey found the respondents' top 3 reasons for refusing a vaccine were the following:“Not sure if it is safe” (73%)
“Not sure if vaccine is effective” (29%)
“A vaccine is not needed to combat COVID-19” (9%)Concern about the safety of a vaccine was higher in Mindanao (78%) and Balance Luzon (76%) compared to Metro Manila (69%) and the Visayas (64%). Along with this, concern about vaccine effectiveness was highest in the Visayas (46%), followed by Metro Manila (34%), Mindanao (27%), and Balance Luzon (21%).
Aside from this, 6% of survey respondents said they would not have themselves vaccinated as the vaccine “might not be free,” while another 6% said they would not get vaccinated because it “might be costly or expensive.”The survey found class D (74%) and E (73%) were more concerned with the safety of vaccines compared to class ABC (46%). It was the reverse for concern over efficacy of vaccines with class ABC (33%) reporting the highest concern about this as compared to class D (28%) and E (29%).For respondents who would reject a vaccine, disapproval was highest among class D, with 46% of the respondents saying they would not have themselves vaccinated. This was followed by class ABC at 45% and class E at 44%.Balance Luzon and the Visayas also recorded the highest percentage of those unwilling to get a vaccine at 47% each, followed by Metro Manila and Mindanao at 43% each.Vaccine acceptance was highest among class ABC and E (23% each), while class D was slightly lower at (18%).
Of the 35% of respondents undecided about the vaccine, uncertainty was highest in Balance Luzon (39%), while Metro Manila, the Visayas, and Mindanao were “almost at par” at 31%, 33%, and 32%, respectively. Among those undecided, 32% were from class ABC, 36% from class D, and 33% from class E.
Low trust in China vaccines
The Octa survey found only 1 in 10 or 15% Filipinos trusted vaccines coming from China, while 4 in 10 (41%) trusted those coming from the United States.In between these, 25% said they trusted vaccines coming from the United Kingdom, followed by 20% from Russia, and 17% if coming from India.The 5 countries cover a portfolio of at least 7 vaccine companies the Philippines has been in advanced negotiations with to purchase vaccines. This included Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), AstraZeneca, Sinovac, and the Gamaleya Research Institute.Why this matters
The number of respondents both unwilling and reluctant to receive a vaccine underscores the challenges health officials still need to confront in boosting demand for the highly scarce and coveted product.This comes on top of issues in vaccine acceptance in the Philippines, which took a hit after the Dengvaxia scandal in 2017 tanked immunization rates of public vaccination programs largely done among the indigent sector.The Philippines so far has been the last in the Southeast Asia region to start rolling out vaccines, after paperwork and limited global supply delayed the delivery of doses secured in negotiations that started only sometime in November 2020. – Rappler.com",Rappler

But the American firm will prioritize vaccine doses for the United States, which has paid almost $2 billion for 100 million doses, says Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez
Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez said American pharmaceutical company Pfizer will ensure supply for the Philippines of its COVID-19 vaccine after it is approved for distribution.
His assurance comes after Pfizer announced that its vaccine candidate proved 90% effective in an initial study of its Phase 3 clinical trials, a ray of hope for people all over the world weary of the ongoing pandemic.
""As long as they get approval and we tell them what we need, they're ready to supply it,"" said Romualdez on Monday, November 9. A video of his remarks were shown to the Malacañang Press Corps on Tuesday.
The Philippines and other countries, however, may have to wait a little longer as Pfizer is prioritizing the United States for its vaccine production this year.
""Of course, their production this year, the United States will go first because they need 100 million vaccine [doses],"" said Romualdez in Filipino.
The ambassador pegged the cost of the Pfizer vaccine at $5 a shot, or around P240 a shot.
The US government had ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine for $1.95 billion, which puts the price per dose at $19.50.
Pfizer, said Romualdez, was the first American pharmaceutical firm to get in touch with him. He had been contact with other companies like Moderna ""3 to 4 months ago"" and these talks were supposedly the fruit of discussions between Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last April.
When will it arrive in the Philippines?
Romualdez estimates that, if all is smooth-sailing, the Pfizer vaccine could get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within the year and Philippine FDA approval early next year.
This could then mean an initial batch of the Pfizer vaccine arriving in the Philippines ""by early next year"" or ""first quarter"" of next year.
Romualdez said Pfizer has not asked for any ""downpayment"" but only a ""purchase order"" signifying the Philippine government's commitment to buy a certain amount of vaccine doses.
Another way a supply of the Pfizer vaccine could reach the country is through the Philippine private sector. Romualdez said Filipino businessmen have expressed willingness to pay for the vaccines so they can provide these to their employees.
Duterte's economic managers are targeting a fund of P20 billion to be used to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, likely from a variety of suppliers.
This fund will come from a loan to be provided by the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government financial institutions. The loan will be given to the Philippine International Trading Corp, which has been authorized to purchase vaccines for the government.
This fund is to shoulder only an ""initial"" batch of vaccines.
Apart from this, there's a P2.5-billion allocation for vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget.
The economic team will have to look for more funding sources after Duterte promised to shoulder the cost of vaccines for all 107 million Filipinos. – Rappler.com",Rappler

“Yes, Ma’am, we will try our best to convince the President to perhaps allow himself to be publicly vaccinated but we will respect his decision,” Duque said.MUST READ
Duterte wants to receive Sinovac vaccine shots 'in private'
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said that Duterte was willing to get vaccinated with Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, but that he wanted this done away from the public eye.Only months ago, Duterte said he was willing to get vaccinated in public with Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine. But Roque said Duterte now believed that public inoculation was not necessary, likening it to how British Royalty were vaccinated in private and informed the public after.""He said there's no need to make it public. He’s taking the route of the British sovereign, because Queen Elizabeth and her husband decided to make their vaccination a private affair,"" said Roque in Filipino.
Duterte's preference is in contrast with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who was vaccinated with Sinovac's CoronaVac on live television last January 14.
Boosting demand
Throughout several Congressional hearings, lawmakers have raised concern over increasing vaccine hesitancy in the Philippines.A Pulse Asia survey conducted from November 23 to December 2, 2020 showed close to a majority of Filipinos or 47% are not willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 32% said they want to be immunized. The remaining 21% were still undecided.
The number of Filipinos willing to get vaccinated was lower than previous figures seen in a Social Weather Stations survey done in September 2020, where 66% said they were willing to receive a COVID-19 shot.A separate survey by the Octa Research Group also showed that 47% of respondents in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the pandemic in the Philippines, were still undecided on getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

https://www.rappler.com/nation/house-approves-indemnification-fund-covid-19-vaccines,House approves P500-M indemnification fund for COVID-19 vaccines,MARA CEPEDA,2021-02-22 19:07:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
The arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines is delayed due to the missing indemnification fund
The House of Representatives passed a bill setting a P500 million indemnification fund to shoulder the medical costs of Filipinos should they experience “adverse effects” after getting vaccinated for the coronavirus.
A total of 225 legislators voted yes to pass House Bill (HB) No. 8648 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 on 3rd and final reading on Monday, February 22, 4 days after President Rodrigo Duterte certified the measure as urgent.
No lawmakers voted against the bill, while 6 abstained from the vote.Duterte certifying HB 8648 as urgent allowed lawmakers to do away with the 3-day mandatory interval between its 2nd and 3rd reading approvals.
If passed into law, HB 8648 would create a COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund worth P500 million, which would augment the funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.
A claim for indemnification for serious adverse events must be filed within 5 years from the day of the person's COVID-19 vaccination.
The indemnification fund would be sourced from the 2021 national budget’s Contingent Fund, which are lump-sum appropriations that the government can tapped to finance unforeseen expenses.
The bill states the indemnity would be valid and available for release until it is fully expended or if the President terminates the program.
HB 8648's initial version did not contain a specific amount for the fund. But prior to the measure's 2nd reading approval on Monday, the plenary agreed to substitute HB 8648 with a new version that contains several amendments to include the P500-million indemnification fund and where it would be sourced.
The House plenary tackled other measures on the floor before approving HB 8648 on 3rd and final reading on Monday.
The Philippine government is on a race to create this indemnification fund since it is among the requirements to gain COVID-19 vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies and the COVAX global facility.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events. This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting emergency use approval for COVID-19 vaccines.Philippine pandemic officials initially announced that COVID-19 vaccines would already arrive by mid-February, but later on said delivery would be delayed due to a lack of an indemnification fund.
The Duterte government was supposedly informed of the indemnification requirement only during the latter phase of vaccine negotiations.MUST READ
Here’s why COVID-19 vaccines haven’t arrived in the Philippines yet
HB 8648 would also grant immunity to public officials and employees, contractors, volunteers, and private sector representatives – including vaccine manufacturers – from claims arising from the vaccine program. But they would not have any immunity if the claims would arise from ""willful misconduct and gross negligence.""
The bill likewise creates a vaccine passport program to serve as a record of the COVID-19 vaccinations received by an individual.
The final version of HB 8648 approved by the House is now closer to the pending Senate version, but some provisions are still either conflicting or are missing from the other chamber's version.
This means both houses would have to convene a bicameral conference committee to thresh out the conflicting provisions before the final version of the bill can be sent to Malacañang for Duterte’s signature.The House or the Senate may also opt to just adopt the version of the other chamber to skip the bicam level.
Fast-tracking vaccine purchase
Apart from creating an indemnification fund, HB 8648 also aims to help expedite the Duterte government’s COVID-19 vaccine procurement by exempting the process from public bidding and granting tax exemptions on the vaccines, supplies, and equipment to be procured.
The bill authorizes the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to engage in ""negotiated procurement under emergency cases"" for the COVID-19 vaccines.
Negotiated procurement would allow the DOH and the NTF to directly negotiate a contract with a capable supplier to speed up the process.
Local government units (LGUs) and private entities would also be allowed to buy COVID-19 vaccines or accept them as donations – but only by signing a multiparty agreement with the national government and the manufacturer concerned. This is the current policy being implemented by the NTF.
LGUs would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for up to 50% of their respective localities' population. But the bill said the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases may adjust this cap when there are enough supplies available. This power granted to LGUs would be valid retroactively starting from January 1, 2021.
The bill also mandates private companies that would be procuring COVID-19 vaccines to administer them for the ""sole and exclusive use of such companies."" This authority would apply retroactively starting November 1, 2020.
The bill likewise grants tax exemptions on the COVID-19 vaccines to be procured.It would also waive the Phase IV clinical trial requirement for COVID-19 medication and vaccines, but the drugs should still be recommended by the World Health Organization and/or other internationally recognized health agencies.Under the bill's multiparty deal scheme, LGUs and private entities would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines that have already been registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been issued emergency use authorization (EUA).
So far, only the vaccines created by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca have secured EUAs from the FDA.If passed into law, the bill's provisions would be valid during the state of calamity and public health emergency that was declared due to COVID-19 or until June 30, 2022 – unless Duterte lifts the state of emergency or extends it. – Rappler.com",Rappler

FDA Director General Eric Domingo says the agency is waiting for lacking documents before it could move on with further reviews
The Food and Drug Adminisitration on Friday, January 8, said it has received an application for emergency use authorization of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute.
In an official statement, the FDA said it received the application for an emergency use authorization (EUA) on Thursday, January 7, one day after the firm expressed interest to secure one.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the submission had been pre-assessed and that its applicant was “instructed to comply with lacking documents.”
Domingo told Rappler that the 21-day period to review Gamaleya's EUA application will not start until it submits all necessary documentary requirements.
Gamaleya earlier eyed Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, and sent a partial submission for these efforts last December 17.
Earlier on Friday, Department of Science and Technology Undersecretary for Rowena Guevara said Gamaleya informed the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel last January 6, that it would no longer pursue trials and instead opt to secure an EUA.Gamaleya’s decision to apply for emergency approval, should it be granted, would bring its vaccine to a larger number of people as opposed to clinical trials where only a set number of individuals who volunteer to participate will receive it.FDA-issued EUAs are a necessary requirement for any vaccine to be used in the Philippines. The institute’s Sputnik V vaccine has obtained emergency approval from Russia, Argentina, and Belarus.The firm earlier announced that its vaccine had an efficacy rate of 91.4%, though it has not published its full findings in a scientific journal.MUST READ

Dr Jonas del Rosario himself contracted COVID-19 and lost his parents to the disease
A doctor and spokesman for the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), the top COVID-19 referral hospital of pandemic epicenter Metro Manila, will be the first person to receive a vaccine through the government's vaccination program.
PGH director Dr Gerardo Legaspi announced this during a Malacañang press briefing on Thursday, February 11.
""We chose our spokesperson, Dr Jonas del Rosario, who since March 22 until today, has been speaking for us everyday,"" said Legaspi in Filipino.
Del Rosario himself contracted COVID-19 and lost both his parents to the respiratory disease.
""Mas maganda para sa mga tao na makita na ang mga taong nagbigay ng kanilang lakas at talino at naapektuhan ng COVID na pinakamatindi ay siya dapat ang mauna,"" said Legaspi to explain why PGH personnel had picked Del Rosario.
Del Rosario will be the first to get the vaccine because PGH has been identified as the hospital that will get the first batch of vaccines. (See the list of priority hospitals here.)
The PGH head said that for hospital doctors and personnel, getting a COVID-19 vaccine shot was a ""symbolic gesture of the final phase of their personal fight against COVID.""
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque, referring to Del Rosario, said, ""You will be part of history as the first to be legally vaccinated with the anti-COVID-19 vaccine.""
But in the same press conference, Roque announced that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the restricted use by President Rodrigo Duterte’s security personnel of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines.
Malacañang has not disclosed details of this deal secured by the Presidential Security Group outside of the government’s official vaccination program. The official program puts military and uniformed personnel on the 5th tier of prioritization, after health frontliners, senior citizens, and persons with comorbidities.
Doctors, hospital workers 'excited' to get vaccinated
PGH doctors and staff are in a state of ""excitement"" over the prospect of getting their first vaccine shot this month, said Legaspi.
At the moment, however, there is no certainty which vaccine they will get. The 117,000 Pfizer vaccines that were supposed to arrive in mid-February will be delayed due to ""processing of documents"" with the COVAX Facility and World Health Organization, said testing czar Vince Dizon in the same press conference.
Despite this ""slight"" delay, the government still expects the Pfizer doses to start arriving within the month of February, said Dizon.
Meanwhile, some 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines are confirmed to arrive on February 23. These doses are a donation from the Chinese government, said Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque.
Still, Legaspi said he is confident that PGH doctors would be willing to take any vaccine as long as it had emergency use approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration.
The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have this approval, but Sinovac so far does not. The Chinese firm applied for an EUA last January 13.
Around 93% of over 5,000 PGH health workers conveyed their wish to be vaccinated, based on a pre-registration survey conducted by the public hospital.

While President Rodrigo Duterte stokes expectations of normalcy 'by December,' experts say even the arrival of a vaccine won't assure this immediately
An infectious disease expert working for the government estimates that the earliest time the Philippines would approve a COVID-19 vaccine for distribution is in the second quarter of 2021 or the months of April to June.
Dr Jaime Montoya, executive director of the Philippine Council for Health Research Development, said this projection takes into consideration the time it will take to conclude crucial Phase 3 trials and the approval process of food and drug administrations.
""My estimate is that it will be available in the Philippines, second quarter of next year,"" he said in a Rappler Talk interview on Friday, September 18.
Dr Melvin Sanicas, a Filipino vaccine expert based in Switzerland, said Montoya's estimate is ""reasonable"" but that it's a ""best-case scenario.""
Montoya's estimated timeline is broken down as follows:
November or December 2020 - Earliest conclusion of Phase 3 trials of any of the 9 most advanced vaccine candidates
January to March 2021 - Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) of the countries where the vaccine candidates are developed approve the vaccine for distribution, based on their assessment of Phase 3 trials.
April to June 2021 - The Philippines' FDA approves a vaccine for local distribution.
This timeline is hinged on many things going right.
The assumption is that Phase 3 trials will run smoothly, which is not always the case. Trials for the vaccine being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, for example, were paused when one of the volunteers experienced an illness. Because the illness turned out to be unrelated to the vaccine, the trials were resumed. But hiccups like this, or even bigger obstacles, can still threaten the progress of Phase 3 trials of all vaccines in the works.
Phase 3 trials are a crucial stage that involves testing thousands of people and comparing results with volunteers given a placebo. This determines if the vaccine is effective in protecting against SARS-CoV-2, and can reveal evidence of other possible side effects that may have been unseen in earlier studies.If a vaccine's Phase 3 trials go well, the results would still have to be assessed by FDAs of its home country and countries that want to distribute the vaccine domestically, like the Philippines.
Montoya said that it's possible for Phase 3 trial data to be submitted to both FDAs simultaneously but this process could lengthen the time it will take for the Philippine FDA to approve the vaccine for distribution. If the home country's FDA were to approve it first, which Montoya estimates could take a month, the Philippines' FDA's assessment would be aided by the approval of the home country's FDA.
Managing expectations set by Duterte
The more realistic expectation of a vaccine approval in the Philippines by the middle of 2021 is in stark contrast to the remarks of President Rodrigo Duterte that Filipinos need only wait until December for a vaccine.""I promise you, by the grace of God, I hope by December we would be back to normal.... Hintayin lang ho ninyo by December kung makatiis kayo (Just wait for December, if you can stand it),"" he said on July 31.
A month later, Duterte claimed that certain vaccines are to be ""distributed worldwide by September, October"" of 2020, again setting expectations.
""When the President said that the vacines are available, he's actually correct. It will be available maybe in their home countriesbut it's unlikely to be available in other countries like the Philippines because, as I said, it will also take time for them to submit their applications to our FDA and for FDA to review it before it can issue an approval for the said vaccine,"" said Montoya.
Duterte has pinned his hopes on 3 China-developed vaccine candidates, Russia's Sputnik V, and the vaccine candidates from US companies Moderna and Pfizer, and UK-Swedish company AstraZeneca.
Consistent with his geopolitical stance, he's given more praise to China and Russia for their assurances that the Philippines would get some level of ""priority"" access to their vaccines.
But he has slammed ""Western"" companies, likely referring to the US and European companies, for supposedly demanding a ""reservation fee"" which Duterte refuses to pay.
Montoya said this fee likely refers to Advance Market Commitment (AMC), which pharmaceutical companies usually ask from governments or other buyers, not just as advance payment but to boost its funding for vaccine development.
Ironically, the Philippines has already agreed to contribute to the AMC being collated by the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility. The Duterte administration is ready to cough up P1.5 billion for the program which ensures that the Philippines and other participating countries will get 20% of their needed vaccine supply from a manufacturer.
Upcoming hurdles: Securing supply and distribution
But even with Philippine FDA approval of a vaccine, there's still the challenge of securing a supply of the vaccine, and then distributing it efficiently to Filipinos.
Montoya said that through the COVAX Facility, the Philippines is assured at least of 20% of its vaccine needs, which could mean two doses of a vaccine for around 10 million people. This is if the Philippines' vaccine needs amount to immunization of 60% of its population, the Department of Health threshold for herd immunity.
But the private sector could move independently of the government and secure its own supply of an FDA-approved vaccine. This means that Filipinos who can afford to can buy a vaccine from their doctor even ahead of the free immunization by the government, which would likely cover only health workers and the poorest Filipinos anyway.
Let's say a vaccine does reach a good number of Filipinos. That doesn't mean health measures like mask-wearing and social distancing will be lifted.
The government will have to see the effects of the vaccine and a significant decrease in the number of infected.
""The effect is not immediate. Yes, you have a vaccine. Yes, you may be protected but of course we still have to see first of all, whether you will have the antibodies and whether the antibodies will be sufficiently high enough and if it will last for a long time,"" said Montoya.
Some scientific groups say that a vaccine may have to be administered every year or once every two to 3 years.
Authorities would have to prepare for logistical concerns like ensuring a ""cold chain"" for a vaccine, or ways of transporting a vaccine such that it is kept to a certain low temperature. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The shortfall comes despite President Rodrigo Duterte's repeated claims that a vaccine is the 'only salvation' from the pandemic
As experts around the world race to find an effective COVID-19 vaccine, the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) said it lacked some P10 billion needed to procure enough doses for the identified priority groups.
At the DOH’s regular press briefing on Monday, October 19, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the initial P2.5 billion allocated for vaccines in the proposed 2021 budget would not cover procurement needed to vaccinate an initial target of 20% of the Philippines’ population.Citing estimated costs computed by the agency, Vergeire said the DOH would need roughly P12.1 billion to purchase doses needed to inoculate priority populations which include health workers and indigent Filipinos.
Vergeire said the amount was based on prospective prices for potential vaccines being marketed, most of which may require two doses.“It totaled to P12.1 billion so we lack about P10 billion in that budget,” Vergeire told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino.Vergeire had made the statement after referring to the lack of funds raised by Marikina City 2nd District Representative Stella Quimbo. She earlier expressed dismay over the P2.5 billion allocation, warning it would cover only 3.9 million of the targeted 20 million to be vaccinated.Why does this matter?
The lack of funds needed to procure enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine highlights the skewed priorities of the government’s pandemic recovery budget.While the country continues to record an increase in cases, the government has earmarked only some P90 billion for coronavirus efforts out of the proposed P4.5 trillion of the 2021 budget.The DOH’s shortfall of about P10 billion also comes as President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly touted a COVID-19 vaccine as the “only salvation” from the pandemic.MUST READ

'Any substance that will effectively and safely protect people is considered halal, especially if it is the only viable option at present,' says Saidamen Pangarungan, secretary of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos
Filipino Muslim leaders on Thursday, February 4, supported the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and quelled fears that these might contain pork products that they do not consider halal (permissible).
""Any substance that will effectively and safely protect people is considered halal, especially if it is the only viable option at present,"" said Saidamen Pangarungan, secretary of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos, in a statement signed by 7 other Islamic leaders.
Pangarungan noted, on one hand, that halal certifying bodies or HCBs in the Philippines have not examined these COVID-19 vaccines.
He said Muslim leaders in the United Kingdom, on the other hand, have issued a favorable fatwa or ruling on these. This fatwa, according to him, states: ""The UK government has confirmed that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any components of animal origin.""
Pangarungan said Pfizer also claims ""that all of their vaccine's components are either plant-based or are synthetic."" Like Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna ""have also stated that their vaccines do not use gelatin or pork products.""
In neighboring Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, Muslim leaders recently certified the Chinese vaccine CoronaVac, too, as halal.

""Due to the pressing need to curb the spread of COVID-19, all Filipinos are urged to avail of the vaccine once they become available in the country,"" Pangarungan said, adding that ""Islam emphasizes the need to protect life.""
Whether COVID-19 vaccines are halal has worried many Muslims around the world, as pork-derived gelatin is commonly used in producing vaccines. Muslim beliefs prohibit the consumption of pork.
More than 6 million Muslims live in the Philippines, making up around 6% of this predominantly Christian country.
The Philippine government has sought the help of religious groups to convince Filipinos to take vaccine shots after a recent Pulse Asia survey showed 47% of Filipinos refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Experts have attributed this to widespread disinformation online. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire gives the assurance amid questions on whether the Philippines can procure the vaccine of US company Moderna, which did not hold clinical trials in the country
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Wednesday, November 18, assured the public that the Philippine government can still procure COVID-19 vaccines from companies like Moderna that did not hold clinical trials in the country.
Vergeire gave the assurance during a virtual press briefing, when she was asked whether the absence of local clinical trials of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine would have any implication on the government's vaccine procurement plan.
""Although, of course, that is the ideal. But if they do not intend, hindi 'yan makaka-stop sa gobyerno para makapag-procure tayo (it won't stop the government to procure) as long as they [follow] the regulatory process at makikita po natin ang mga naging epekto ng kanilang (and we can see the effects [or results] of their] phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3,"" Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing.
She added that if the country's vaccine expert panel would be able to evaluate the vaccine and gets the Food and Drug Administration approval, ""then we can readily procure these sets of vaccines.""
Moderna announced on Monday that its experimental vaccine against COVID-19 was almost 95% effective, marking a second major breakthrough in the quest to end the pandemic.
Moderna released early results from a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants, days after American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced that said their vaccine was 90% effective.

Vergeire earlier said that Moderna was not ""really interested in conducting clinical trials outside the US, but they want to provide [doses] to us."" (READ: PH in talks for possible purchase of US Moderna vaccine by 2021)
Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval in the US and around the world within weeks, and said it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect human health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr, who is also the National Task Force Chief Implementer, said on November 9 that supplies of a COVID-19 vaccine will most likely arrive in the Philippines by the end of 2021 or in early 2022.

(UPDATED) The Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, East Avenue Medical Center, and Dr Jose N Rodriguez Hospital specifically will receive doses of the Pfizer vaccine
When a COVID-19 vaccine finally arrives in the Philippines, initial doses will be prioritized for health workers working in hospitals treating coronavirus patients.Vaccine czar Carlito Gavlez Jr said hospital workers in high-risk geographical areas would be among the first to be vaccinated against the disease since it was necessary to ensure essential health services continued while the pandemic was still ongoing.“Our hospitals will be first,” Galvez said when asked by Senator Nancy Binay where first doses of a vaccine will go.
Which vaccine will be given?
On February 3, Galvez listed the Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, East Avenue Medical Center, and Dr Jose N Rodriguez Hospital specifically will receive 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine supplied by the COVAX facility.
After these hospitals located in Metro Manila – the epicenter of the pandemic in the Philippines – COVID-19 referral hospitals in Cebu City and Davao City will follow.
Another 5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine are expected to arrive in the first half of 2021.
Considering the status of negotiations and regulatory requirements, Galvez earlier said the first vaccines that could arrive in the Philippines include those being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, Sinovac, or AstraZeneca.
Among these options, Galvez said Pfizer’s vaccine may be the first to arrive by the end of February through allocations from the GAVI COVAX facility. COVAX officials are currently finalizing a list of low-income countries to be given doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for an early rollout.Galvez said a specific amount of doses to arrive were not yet available as arrangements were still being finalized, though shipments may contain some 50,000 doses for 25,000 health workers.
Unlike other vaccines being eyed by the government, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have so far secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Pfizer vaccine was the first to be granted emergency approval after the FDA said its review process determined the Pfizer vaccine with an efficacy of 95% met all conditions for an EUA and that that the “benefit of using the vaccine outweighs its known and potential risks.”

As for Sinovac, Galvez said the government signed a term sheet that saw the company commit to supply with country with 25 million doses, though this will be contingent on whether it secured FDA emergency approval.
Without clearance from the FDA, Sinovac cannot be used in the Philippines. The company earlier submitted an application for an EUA, but FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the agency was waiting for phase 3 trial results before moving on to a full review.

Cold storage preparation
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the government was preparing ultracold storage facilities needed to keep Pfizer’s vaccines stable once they arrive in the country.Duque said the agency purchased 10 ultralow freezers for this, while officials were also in talks with several logistics and cold storage facilities that have the facilities and extensive experience to handle the vaccine. This included Orca, Royal Cargo, Maersk, LBC, Metro Pacific, and Zuellig Pharma Corporation, among others.
Pfizer officials earlier explained that while doses may last up to 6 months in ultra-low temperature freezers, they can be stored up to 30 days in thermal shippers the company designed, and up to 5 days in normal refrigerated 2-8°C conditions – posing a challenge for the Philippines’ health system. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III says the government and private sector are in negotiations for 178 million doses for Filipinos
The Philippines is preparing to order enough coronavirus vaccines for 92 million doses, 20 million more than its vaccination program target, in anticipation of delays and other complications, said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III.
He gave this figure in a report to President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 1, at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse during a meeting with other Cabinet members.
""We have negotiated for 92 million because we read in the newspapers about slippage, delays in delivery. There's delays in Europe, there's delays in the US, so to be safe we are negotiating more than what we need of 70 million,"" said Dominguez.
""We really expect delays but delay is not our fault because we have the money and we are ready, the delay is in the manufacturing,"" he continued.
The government and private sector are already in negotiations to bring the Philippines' total vaccine orders to 178 million doses, said Dominguez. Since most COVID-19 vaccines come in two doses, these would be enough for 89 million Filipinos.
Funding for vaccines
As it stands, the country has locked in some 146 million doses of vaccines – 40 million from the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility and some 106 million to 108 million from direct arrangements with various pharmaceutical firms.
Dominguez said the deals with firms will be paid for using loans from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, cumulatively worth $1.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the Philippines paid $84 million to participate in the COVAX scheme, said Dominguez.
The 146 million doses would be enough to vaccinate all Filipino adults, which the finance chief said number around 70 million. The remaining 40 million in the country's population are one to 18 year-olds who may not be allowed to get vaccine shots for safety reasons. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The Philippines has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year
The Philippines will let thousands of its healthcare workers, mostly nurses, take up jobs in Britain and Germany if the two countries agree to donate much-needed coronavirus vaccines, a senior official said on Tuesday, February 23.
The Philippines, which has among Asia's highest number of coronavirus cases, has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year.
Alice Visperas, director of the labor ministry's international affairs bureau, said the Philippines was open to lifting the cap in exchange for vaccines from Britain and Germany, which it would use to inoculate outbound workers and hundreds of thousands of Filipino repatriates.
Nurses are among the millions of Filipinos who work overseas, providing in excess of $30 billion a year in remittances vital to the country's economy.
""We are considering the request to lift the deployment cap, subject to agreement,"" Visperas told Reuters.
Britain is grappling with the world's sixth-highest coronavirus death toll and one of the worst economic hits from the pandemic, while Germany has the 10th most infections globally.
While the two countries have inoculated a combined 23 million people, the Philippines has yet to start its campaign to immunize 70 million adults, or two-thirds of its 108 million people. It expects to receive its first batch of vaccines this week, donated by China.
The Philippines wants to secure 148 million doses of vaccines altogether.
The British embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while calls to Germany's mission went unanswered.
In 2019, almost 17,000 Filipino nurses signed overseas work contracts, government data showed.
While Filipino nurses have fought to lift the deployment ban to escape poor working conditions and low pay at home, the workers-for-vaccine plan has not gone down well with some medical workers.
""We are disgusted on how nurses and healthcare workers are being treated by the government as commodities or export products,"" Jocelyn Andamo, secretary general of the Filipino Nurses United, told Reuters. – Rappler.com",Rappler

A timeline shared by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III shows how a mix of red tape and unfamiliarity with new vaccine technology slowed down the process of securing a purchase deal long before it could even start
From the early days of the pandemic, President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly touted the need for a vaccine to salvage the country from COVID-19.Several of the Chief Executive’s speeches have been peppered with statements on the much-needed relief a vaccine would bring to the economy, along with promises to inoculate the entire population for free.But new details shared by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III showed it took the Duterte administration about 4 to 5 months to sign a confidentiality data agreement (CDA) that would cover negotiations with vaccine developer Pfizer, raising questions about whether government officials moved fast enough to secure for the country the scarce supply.From when Pfizer officials approached the Philippine government in late June to start discussions on its vaccine candidates, it was only in late October, or 4 months after, that the CDA, a preliminary document, was signed. With other government officials like vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, the timeline stretched further to November when a CDA was finalized.Duque detailed the timeline of critical dates in the government’s dealings with Pfizer officials in response to allegations that he bungled a deal to secure the vaccine supplies by January.The health secretary found himself on the defense after Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr posted a cryptic tweet that an offer brokered by him, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would have locked in 10 million doses of the vaccine by as early as January 2021 “but that somebody dropped the ball.”“I have the chronology of events so that this is all documented. So there is no such thing as 'I did not act quick enough,'” Duque said in an interview on ANC Headstart on Thursday, December 17.MUST READ
Locsin shares foiled plan to secure 10M Pfizer vaccine doses by January
Red tape
What Duque’s timeline does show is how a mix of bureaucratic red tape, coupled with the uncertainty of a new vaccine, hampered the process of negotiating a purchase deal long before it could even start.In the case of a CDA – a preliminary document that would allow scientists to review Pfizer’s vaccine development data – signing this would be the first step in opening negotiations on the possible securement of doses.
Yetgovernment agencies passed the buck in signing a CDA on behalf of the Philippine government.First, from the DOH, Duque said an inter-agency task force resolution mandated that Pfizer’s overview on its vaccines should be given to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development as the lead agency in vaccine assessment.This differed from the preference of Pfizer, which initially wanted the Office of the President to sign the CDA on behalf of the government. It would take another month for the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) to designate the DOH as signatory.While the period for signing a CDA varies for the parties involved and terms being discussed, the global race to secure limited vaccine supplies has underscored the need not just for money, but agility from governments to move on locking down purchase deals. In a pandemic where hundreds may become ill or die in a single day, time is a precious resource.
How much of a factor was red tape in the weeks it took the government to sign a CDA with Pfizer? Duque was evasive, saying a new vaccine should afford the government some “allowance.”
“You have to give allowances to the fact that, I for one, this is my first time to have signed a CDA. So I have to be very, very cautious in what I am signing to ensure the government’s interest is first and foremost protected. That there are no onerous provisions,” Duque said.Asked why the OES, on behalf of the OP, passed on the responsibly to the DOH, Duque said the decision was also fueled by caution.“It was his judgment that because (a) vaccine is health-related, it was directly aligned to the mandate of the DOH. So that reason is well grounded,” he said.On the other hand, the health secretary said the process for evaluating vaccines was also revised in the context of the pandemic.Whereas the DOH was usually the only agency that assessed vaccines to be used in the Philippines, the inter-agency task force agreed the DOST would lead reviews through an expert panel focused on the scientific assessment of a COVID-19 vaccine.The arrangement, though well-intended, exposed how added layers of screening could prove detrimental if not optimized for a highly competitive vaccine like Pfizer and BioNTech’s.“Medyo talagang nung una, nagkakaproblema kasi (At the start, this was a problem because) if we follow the process, dapat nga 'yan (that should be) DOST, based on the IATF. It was Pfizer that wanted the Office of the President,” Duque said.MUST READ
TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Balancing act
This battle against time had to contend with the uncertainty over a new vaccine.As a public official, Duque said protocols must be followed and that “we cannot just be buying a vaccine like chocolate.” Further, as a medical professional, Duque said his principle was to remain prudent. “My overriding principle in my practice of medicine is always to err on the side of caution,” he said.For Duque, another factor that influenced his actions was the memory of the Dengvaxia scandal that tanked child immunization rates in the Philippines. The aftermath took its toll on children as the Philippines experienced a measles and polio outbreak it continues to address until today.
“There are too many unknowns and that’s why I said earlier, my overriding principle is, we have to be cautious with the health and lives of our people. We have long experience with different vaccines and we don’t want a repeat of very costly lessons we experienced in the past with some of the vaccines,” he said.The following key dates, as enumerated by Duque, detail this process:(We have included all dates mentioned, along with Duque’s description of events that took place on specific dates.)
June 24, 2020 -Pfizer sends an overview of its candidate vaccine development and manufacturing program to the Philippine government.June 29, 2020 - DOH, through its pharmaceutical division, refers the proposal to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD) as the lead agency in the management of vaccine development for COVID-19 response.August 6 - DOH sends a letter to Pfizer reiterating that its overview should be given to the DOST.August 7 - A meeting is held between Pfizer and DOH officials to discuss the use of its mRNA or messenger RNA technology in the company’s potential COVID-19 vaccine.Duque said that this meeting is where he raised many questions on the use of mRNA vaccines and whether or not these have been deployed in different countries. “And they said yes for HIV-AIDS and that’s about it. There has been no experience; DOH neither has experience in these long years of its immunization program, we never had this kind of technology,” he said.August 11 - Pfizer sends a draft CDA to the DOH.Duque said the CDA was initially meant to be signed by the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) on behalf of all government agencies.This arrangement would have eliminated the need for multiple government agencies to sign their own CDA with Pfizer. In a recent forum, the DOH said that they were trying to streamline the current setup which saw different agencies each having their own CDAs.August 26 - DOH re-endorses to Pfizer comments from “relevant technical offices” in the Philippine government.Duque said he cannot disclose details of the agreement or its provisions as he is bound by the CDA.
September 4 - Pfizer meets with key DOH and DOST officials, as well as Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to provide updates on their vaccine development.At this time, Duque said Pfizer explained it had two candidates qualified in terms of a safety and efficacy profile after Phase 1 and 2 trials.He also said this is when the company disclosed it had the potential supply of 100 million doses by the end of 2020, though this would be subject to regulatory approval. The company added it had a projected production of 1.3 billion doses by 2021, he added.Duque claimed 10 million doses were said to be set aside for the world market “outside of those that were given to the originating countries like the US,” in effect, disputing Locsin’s claim that the amount was offered specifically to the Philippines.Aside from this, Duque said the company was not interested in conducting Phase 3 trials– something the country preferred so that it could clear the vaccine for “ethnic diversity.” Researchers often test medicines on diverse populations as not all race and ethnic groups will respond the same way to medicines and potential side effects.On Friday, December 16, Locsin maintained an offer from the US had been made on Pfizer's vaccine but that it has since gone to Singapore.
September 11 - Pfizer receives the DOH’s comments on the CDADuque said there was a back and forth between the government and Pfizer officials on certain provisions that were supposedly “one-sided.”“This is not as simple as drafting a document for a medicine or vaccine that you’ve used in the past,” he said in Filipino.September 14 - Duque receives a revised draft CDA with revisions from the office of the deputy executive secretary. He says he also forwarded a summary of revisions from Pfizer and the DOH, among others.September 17 - The DOH sends a letter to the OES on the CDA. Reviews take place over the next few days.
September 24 - Pfizer sends an email to the DOH, saying it had been advised by the Office of the President, through the office of the executive secretary, that the DOH will be the signatory to the CDA. The company also requests for a coordination meeting. “So we met immediately,” Duque said.September 25 - The DOH responds to hold a meeting with Pfizer.Duque said this was needed since Pfizer initially wanted the President’s office to sign the CDA.“Hindi nga ako pupuwede mag-sign (I really cannot sign) for the national government. I can only sign for the DOH. And that is why it is small wonder that DOST also signed in November a separate CDA with Pfizer. Even Secretary Galvez signed a separate CDA with Pfizer also in November,” Duque said on Thursday.October 20 - Duque signs the CDA with Pfizer.According to him, Pfizer agreed that the DOH could sign on behalf of the government, on the condition that it would sign separate CDAs with different agencies as needed.Significant deal
While negotiations are ongoing between Pfizer officials and the Philippine government, what may have been a possible delay in signing necessary documents could prove costly for Filipinos.
Though Pfizer’s vaccine possessed a logistical headache for the Philippines, it has a strategic position in attaining emergency authorization from the FDA.For one, the US FDA has issued its own emergency authorization for the vaccine – a major factor and requirement to attaining a similar emergency clearance from the Philippines. This is buoyed by several clearances that regulatory agencies in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom have granted the company.Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was also the first to show promising results of 95% efficacy. This was announced on November 18.
Meanwhile, for all of the health secretary's uncertainty on the vaccine, a CDA could have covered in part, if not full, a review of scientific and trial data that would shed light on the way the vaccine worked. Duque mentioned that the agreement was to facilitate the sharing of data.

For now, Filipinos must wait as no details on the specific number of doses to be purchased by the government have been disclosed.

The latest allegation sees the Department of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of Science and Technology denying it did not act on Sinopharm's proposals for vaccine trials in the country
While the Duterte government’s use of smuggled coronavirus vaccines remains unresolved, Philippine health officials once again found themselves on the defense against accusations of negligence.The latest allegation on Friday, January 1, sees the Department of Health (DOH) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denying it stalled documents needed for late stage trials of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Chinese state-owned firm Sinopharm.The DOH and FDA branded as “baseless” reports that it failed to act on documents needed for the Philippines’ participation in trials for the vaccine, pointing instead to Sinopharm’s lack of a reply to a letter the Philippine government sent on its proposals for collaboration.The issue is the latest in a wave of rumors facing the DOH and FDA as the Philippines lags in a global race to secure supplies of a COVID-19 vaccine either through access to doses in Phase 3 trials or through purchase agreements.Before the issue raised involving Sinopharm, officials from the two agencies leading the Philippines pandemic response were forced to address allegations it bungled a deal assuring Filipinos early access to Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine.And only days ago were health officials again bewildered by early vaccination efforts done by top government officials and members of President Rodrigo Duterte’s close-in security.The unregulated immunization activities had involved the use of smuggled COVID-19 vaccines, violating a number of laws including the FDA Act. It remains unresolved as the Duterte government has not answered questions hounding the searing issue.MUST READ
5 nagging questions the Duterte gov’t has not answered on its use of unregistered vaccines
What Sinopharm trials?
In an official statement on Friday, the DOH and FDA responded to reports “purporting that the DOH did not act on documents for the participation of the Philippines in the clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Sinopharm.”
The DOH denied this, citing an inter-agency task force (IATF) resolution issued last May 2020, where it had approved Sinopharm’s participation in trials in the Philippines.While the IATF approved the Department of Science and Technology’s (DOST) recommendation to collaborate with Sinopharm for trials, part of this included securing the FDA’s approval for trials.The DOST also belied accusations the Philippine government did not take necessary steps to push trials forward, saying it responded to Sinopharm’s proposals for collaboration.The DOST said Sinopharm proposed cooperation could take place in two ways. First, through trials that the Philippines would fund or through the Philippine government recognizing of authorization for Sinopharm’s vaccine granted by China’s regulatory authorities.On the first proposal, the DOST said the Philippines “only funds trials under the WHO (World Health Organization) Solidarity Trial.” The DOST, meanwhile, did not mention if it commented on Sinopharm’s second proposal. But by practice and FDA guidelines on granting emergency authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, China’s FDA is not among worldwide regulatory authorities the Philippines included for “reliance or recognition” pathways when granting approval for vaccines.The use of “reliance and recognition pathways” help to speed approval of medical goods by allowing the FDA to cooperate with trusted authorities– like their counterparts in the United States, Japan, Australia, European Union, Singapore, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the World Health Organization, among others.The DOST said “Sinopharm never responded to this letter” where it replied to its proposals.In October 2020, the Chinese firm informed the Philippines it was no longer interested in conducting trials, saying it opted to supply doses of the vaccine to the country.The FDA added that as of January 1, 2021, Sinopharm has not submitted any application for clinical trials nor emergency use authorization (EUA) of their vaccine in the Philippines. Only Pfizer has applied for an EUA in the Philippines.

Why it matters
As rest of the world moves forward to secure more doses, the Philippines has so far only closed a solid purchase agreement with AstraZeneca.A tripartite agreement involving the pharmaceutical firm, the Philippine government, and private sector secured 2.6 million doses, while a second batch is in negotiations.Other than this, Phase 3 clinical trials for Janssen Pharmaceutica’s vaccine are expected to begin this month after its application was approved before the end of 2020.Meanwhile, the Duterte government is banking on the arrival of Chinese vaccines by March so it could start to tame the pandemic within the first few months of 2021 but so far, no vaccine made in China has applied for the necessary emergency authority to be granted by the FDA.Obstacles facing the Philippines procurement of vaccines come against the backdrop of increasing COVID-19 cases.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Wednesday, January 6, that drug maker AstraZeneca has submitted an application for emergency approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.
“They did. Just now,” FDA Director General Enrique Domingo confirmed to Rappler in a text message on Wednesday afternoon.AstraZeneca’s application is the second to be filed with the FDA, following Pfizer’s submission to the agency last December 23. The application brings AstraZeneca a step closer to allowing Filipinos access to its vaccine within the year.With AstraZeneca’s submission now with the FDA, regulators will spend about a month reviewing trial data and other information to determine the quality, safety, and efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine on the Philippine population.AstraZeneca was recently granted emergency approval in the United Kingdom, making it the first country to roll out the vaccine for public use.MUST READ

Why this matters
AstraZeneca’s filing is timely and strategic considering the company is the only firm to sign solid tripartite agreements with the national government, local government units, and private sector in the Philippines.This includes a purchase deal closed by the private sector and national government for 2.6 million doses, as well as a separate deal signed by Quezon City for 750,000 doses.Apart from this, Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion earlier said negotiations for a second batch were underway as over 200 companies “and counting” pledged to purchase and expressed their interest in the vaccine.
Vaccine performance
The company’s vaccine is among those at the forefront of vaccine development.Early analysis of clinical trial results showed an average efficacy of about 70%. On the higher end, the vaccine was seen to be 90% effective in participants who were given a half dose, followed by a full dose. This was compared to 62% efficacy seen in participants who were given two full doses.Its vaccine can be transported and handled ""at normal refrigerated conditions"" of between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months, making it compatible with the Department of Health (DOH) storage facilities. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The ADB says the Philippines may opt to increase its vaccine borrowings up to $500 million (P24.05 billion) from the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility
Asian Development Bank (ADB) country director Kelly Bird on Monday, December 21, said the Philippine government asked for $325 million (P15.6 billion) for the purchase and logistical costs of COVID-19 vaccines.
Bird said the Philippines may opt to increase its vaccine borrowings up to $500 million (P24.05 billion) from the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), which has a total allocation of $9 billion for ADB member countries.
The loan terms and interest rate have not been disclosed yet, as the ADB is still coordinating the deal with the Department of Finance and the Department of Health. Bird, however, noted that the loan will be concessional or will have a long grace period and low interest rate.
Bird added that the amount is ""above and beyond"" the $9.4-billion (P452-billion) sovereign lending program for the Philippines, which covers mostly infrastructure projects.
Criteria
The ADB said it will only fund vaccines that have satisfied any of the following criteria:Selected for procurement via COVAX on behalf of participating countriesPrequalified by the World Health Organization
Authorized by a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) for manufacture in an SRA country or the SRA has authorized its manufacture in a non-SRA country
The Philippine government would also submit a national vaccination plan, which safeguards against exclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups.
The latest developments on the financing that the government is tapping come as it lags in the race to get COVID-19 vaccines.
Indonesia has secured 338 million doses from 5 developers, while Malaysia has secured 14 million doses, most of which would come from Pfizer.
The Philippines' first stockpile of vaccines, 2.6 million doses worth around P700 million, were secured through the efforts of the private sector.
President Rodrigo Duterte and his team struggled to pay in advance for vaccines, supposedly due to the country's strict procurement laws. But even Duterte's officials, particularly his spokesperson Harry Roque, noted that international deals are exempted from such rules.
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III pointed to red tape coupled with the uncertainty of a new vaccine as factors hampering the process of negotiating a purchase deal. – Rappler.com",Rappler

(1st UPDATE) Father Nicanor Austriaco’s assertion runs contrary to WHO’s position that 'there is no reason not to recommend its use,' even in countries where the South African variant was detected
The Philippines’ 17 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses ""will be ineffective"" – because they would supposedly require an additional shot per person – if the government cannot curb cases of the COVID-19 South African variant in the country, an expert warned on Wednesday, March 3.
In a virtual press briefing, Octa Research fellow and molecular biologist Father Nicanor Austriaco cited studies showing that the efficacy of the ""AstraZeneca vaccine against B1351 dramatically decreased from 70% to 10%.""""With 10% protection, basically, most people would still be able to get mild and moderate COVID-19,"" he said.
The study cited by Austriaco was disclosed by AstraZeneca itself. It had a small sample involving healthy young adults. (READ: AstraZeneca COVID shot less effective against South African variant – study)
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) of the World Health Organization (WHO) still recommends the use of AstraZeneca, including in countries where the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce its efficacy. It said the vaccine should be given in two doses with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks, and should also be used in people aged 65 and older.
Even in countries such as South Africa, where questions have been raised about the AstraZeneca vaccine's efficacy against a newly-emerged variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, ""there is no reason not to recommend its use,"" SAGE chair Alejandro Cravioto had said on February 10.
Since AstraZeneca vaccines come in two doses each, Austriaco said, “We would need three doses of the remaining vaccines because you'd need one booster shot just for the B1351 variant.”While he didn’t disclose it during the press conference, Austriaco is part of a team developing another vaccine. In an interview with CNN Philippines in early February, he said he would be in the United States to conduct experiments on a yeast-based oral vaccine against COVID-19.

The country is expecting up to 9 million doses to be delivered from COVAX in the first quarter of 2021, and 17 million purchased by private sector and local governments by the second quarter of 2021.

President Rodrigo Duterte's approval is needed since Philippine auditing and procurement laws prohibit making advance payments
President Rodrigo Duterte has approved the Philippine government’s prepayment for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, paving the way for the country’s access to the medicine expected to provide protection against the virus.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire announced this in a press briefing on Monday, November 23, saying, “Yes, I want to confirm that the President has already approved this prepayment.”
Vergeire added the final price for vaccines could not be disclosed until the deal was final since the government signed a confidentiality agreement with the company.
Duterte’s approval for the purchase is needed as Philippine auditing and procurement laws prohibit making advance payments for services and supplies not delivered yet.
Why this matters
The country’s pandemic officials earlier sought Duterte’s approval for advance payments for COVID-19 vaccines, which were necessary to secure supplies of doses once a viable vaccine becomes available.Unlike most other countries, the Philippines has been constrained in securing supplies for a vaccine as it could not easily make the necessary payment as commitment.Duterte’s special approval will be complemented by arrangements with the Asian Development Bank and other financing institutions, as well as big business groups that expressed willingness to handle advanced payments for the Philippines.Supplies ensured
Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez earlier said Pfizer was ready to supply the Philippines with doses of its vaccine once it was approved by local regulatory authorities.Still, most of the companies’ supplies produced this year will likely be given to the United States, which ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine for $1.95 billion.
Data from Phase 3 clinical trials showed that Pfizer’s vaccine prevented mild and severe forms of COVID-19, was 95% effective, and had no serious side effects. – Rappler.com",Rappler

Carlito Galvez Jr, who is already pandemic national action plan chief implementer, is the 5th 'czar' in the government's COVID-19 response
President Rodrigo Duterte has assigned the role of ""vaccine czar"" to National Action Plan vs COVID-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr, Malacañang said on Monday, November 2.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque replied in the affirmative to reporters asking to clarify if Duterte's statements in a Super Typhoon Rolly (Goni) situationer meeting meant Galvez had been given the role.
""Pagbili ng bakuna, the negotiation, manufacture, production, or distribution, binigay ko 'yan kay Secretary Galvez,"" Duterte said during the meeting held at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse.
(For the purchase of a vaccine, negotiation, manufacture, production, or distribution, I've given it to Secretary Galvez.)
""Only Secretary Galvez is authorized to negotiate or whatever. Isa lang. Ayaw ko 'yang committee-committee. Matagal 'yan (Just one person. I don't like committees. They take too long.),"" the President said.
But despite Duterte's disdain for ""committees,"" his own coronavirus task forces are actually composed of a variety of task groups and technical working groups – groups of government officials representing relevant government agencies.
'Task group' on vaccine distribution
Last Thursday, October 29, the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) created a structure that would manage and distribute COVID-19 vaccines once they become available to the Philippines.
The vaccine task group is to be led by the Department of Health. It's not clear how Galvez's new role as ""vaccine czar"" affects this arrangement. (READ: What we know about the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccine plans)
In the same meeting, Duterte expressed his preference for ""only one line of authority come from the task force.""
Galvez already has a leadership role in the government's pandemic efforts, being chief implementer of the national action plan.
His role is distinct from Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who heads the National Task Force vs COVID-19 (NTF), and Duque who heads the policy-making IATF-EID.
The 57-year-old Galvez served as chief of the military from April to December 2018. After his retirement, Duterte appointed him Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process.
Apart from Galvez, there are 4 other ""czars"" in the Duterte government's COVID-19 response – testing czar Vince Dizon, treatment czar Leopoldo Vega, tracing czar Benjamin Magalong, and isolation czar Mark Villar.

President Rodrigo Duterte says he made the plea with Chinese President Xi Jinping himself 4 days ago
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, President Rodrigo Duterte said he has pleaded with Chinese President Xi Jinping to prioritize the Philippines when providing an effective vaccine that would cure COVID-19.Duterte disclosed this during his 5th State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 27, saying he “made a plea” to Xi 4 days ago.“Four days ago I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first – or if it's needed that we will have to buy it – that we will be granted credit so we can normalize as fast as possible,” Duterte said in his speech.Coronavirus cases have continued to increase in the Philippines with over 82,000 infected as of Monday. At the start of his speech, Duterte agonized over the “troubled times” the Philippines was experiencing due to the pandemic, pinning his hopes on a vaccine would be “around the corner.”Duterte had earlier spoken with Xi in a 20-minute phone call last June 11 where the Chinese President assured Duterte of China’s assistance in the coronavirus pandemic.
The Philippines is looking to start Phase 3 clinical trials for 5 vaccines in October 2020. Of the 5, 3 are candidate vaccines being developed in China.The global race for a vaccine was recently hit by controversy after the United State Justice Department accused a pair of Chinese hackers of attempting to steal vaccine research and hacking hundreds of companies in the US.The fallout has so far seen Washington order Beijing to close its consulate in Houston, escalating tensions between the two powers.Intelligence agencies in the US, United Kingdom, and Canada also warned hackers believed to be part of Russian intelligence were trying to steal information about a coronavirus vaccine, as reported by the Associated Press.

https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/nagging-questions-duterte-government-has-not-answered-on-use-of-unregistered-covid-19-vaccines,5 nagging questions the Duterte gov’t has not answered on its use of unregistered vaccines,SOFIA TOMACRUZ,2020-12-30 15:39:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
(UPDATED) Donated? Smuggled? And ordered by whom? As burning questions on early COVID-19 vaccinations linger, Malacañang wants to insist the issue is ‘over’ while health experts express alarm on its unregulated use.
While millions of Filipinos wait to receive a COVID-19 shot, the latest pandemic violation came in secret doses of an unregistered vaccine used on top government officials and members of President Rodrigo Duterte’s close-in security.The unregulated vaccination violated laws that assured the public safety of medicines, bewildering the government’s own health officials and leaving medical experts alarmed over its impact on forthcoming immunization efforts seeking to end the public health emergency.After all, the success of vaccination programs, the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) pointed out, “hinged on mutual trust between the public and institutions.” It’s a lesson the Department of Health knows painfully well, after the tainted Dengvaxia immunization program left public health programs in pieces.But while the country still lacks an approved vaccine against the disease, this has not stopped other public officials from deciding on their own which vaccine to use and on whom – an authority reserved for regulatory and medical experts.It was no less than President Rodrigo Duterte who revealed the day after Christmas that vaccines were already given to some people in government.“Sabihin ko, marami na magpa-injection dito sa Sinopharm (I’ll say it, many here have been injected with Sinopharm)…. I have to be frank, I have to tell the truth,” Duterte claimed, leaving his men to make sense of the searing issue. Now faced with public backlash for the selective vaccinations, Malacañang would have the public just “accept” these took place. “Tapos na po ang usapan na 'yan (That issue is over),” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said.But the Palace’s attempts to end the issue failed to explain how the unregulated immunization efforts took place.Rappler lists 5 critical questions left unanswered by the Duterte government.Who received a vaccine?
Regulatory bodies across the world have granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines because these are still considered to be in the development phase. That means strict monitoring is needed to document all information on its use and watch out for possible side effects.Without details of who received a vaccine, health authorities cannot implement proper surveillance.
The President may have divulged that soldiers were among those who received a vaccine but it was Interior Secretary Eduardo Año who later detailed that those inoculated belonged to the Presidential Security Guard (PSG). The Armed Forces of the Philippines at first declined to name which unit the soldiers belonged to, but later confirmed that it was indeed the PSG.This prompted PSG Commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante to speak up on the matter, saying members of the President’s close-in security were given a vaccine as a necessary and “courageous” step that would assure Duterte’s safety.“We are in a state of war; a war against COVID-19. War compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. As such, PSG exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the Filipino people,” Durante said in an official statement.Año had also disclosed that at least one Cabinet official benefited from the early vaccination but declined to name the official out of “privacy.”As the Philippines faces the mammoth challenge of procuring scarce supply of vaccines, jabs given to these select individuals fall out of line in the government’s own target list of priority groups – the first of whom were frontline health workers tending to coronavirus patients.DUTERTE CABINET.

Did Duterte sanction the vaccination?
Malacañang has defended the issue by arguing that it was not unlawful for people to receive an unregistered vaccine. But what of those who brought the vaccines into the Philippines?The question over who ordered unapproved vaccines to be used will point to those who can be sanctioned for circumventing the government’s own rules. Unauthorized immunizations violate the Food and Drug Administration Act which prohibits the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, transfer, and use of unregistered health products, among others.What’s clear for now is that officials either “do not know,” have refused to name, or clashed on who directed the vaccination.
On December 28, the first Monday after Duterte opened the blistering issue, Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana said the vaccination of soldiers followed the chain of command.“Of course, our President is our commander-in-chief of the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines). I should say it's from the chain of command of the Armed Forces,” he told DWIZ when asked if the decision came from Malacañang or the AFP.But in a virtual press briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque threw it back to the military, saying the decision “must have been made” by them since vaccines would not reach soldiers without the go-signal of commanders.Overnight, statements would continue to change and take shape. Asked to comment on the Army’s remarks, Roque said he was not aware of what the Armed Forces claimed. “They must be privy to that information, I am not,” he said, adding he did not interfere with what could involve “national security.”
On the side of health officials, FDA Director General Enrique Domingo told media he was not aware of who made the decision to have soldiers vaccinated and that Health Secretary Francisco Duque III seemed to be in the dark too.“I spoke to Secretary (Duque), nagulat din po siya (he was also surprised),” Domingo said.The FDA chief was careful to answer questions that “speculated” on who was responsible, instead seeking to wait on more information from a probe the agency had launched. He doubted Duterte sanctioned the unregulated immunization, saying, “Hindi naman po siguro galing sa pangulo iyon ano” (That probably didn’t come from the President.)
The statement again changed when Durante said in an interview on ANC on Saturday, December 30, that the PSG did its own research on what vaccine to use for its unit. They did not ask permission from Duterte who was supposedly told only after the fact, he said.By December 30, Durante said he was taking ""full responsibility"" over the PSG's use of an unapproved vaccine, that it was done ""independently,"" and no one convinced them do it. ""We vaccinated ourselves. It's so easy,"" he said.

RTVM SCREENSHOT
Which vaccines were used and how were doses brought into the country?
Duterte cited Sinopharm in his speech where he revealed the early vaccinations, but details on this were left out by his officials as the issue unfolded over the next few days.Domingo said that among the questions FDA’s probe seeks to answer include exactly what vaccine was used as well as the current status of the immunization activities. The investigation on this would take a “few days,” he added.Durante did not want to cite what vaccine was used, nor the source it came from since this could threaten the government’s procurement efforts. He only described the shot as “one of the safest” and “very traditional.”But how did it enter the Philippines in the first place, without the knowledge of the FDA that would clear it?Bureau of Customs Assistant Commissioner and spokesperson Philip Vincent Maronilla said the agency was clueless as well. The vaccine used by Duterte’ security and top officials of the government, he added, had no official papers.Maronilla told DZBB that when Customs officials reviewed their records in “so far as vaccines brought in for the use of general public,” no instructions involving the matter had been given to them. He said if the vaccines are proven smuggled, officials involved could face administrative and civil cases.
According to Roque, the vaccines were given as a donation. He even categorized them as “tokens” and likened the extremely scarce item to a birthday cake that personnel from his office gave him, sidestepping a reporter's question if it could be considered corruption for receiving the valuable donation.
If this was so, who did it come from? “Hindi ko po alam (I don’t know), Roque said. “Kung ano po ang sinabi ng aking amo, iyon lang po (Whatever my boss has said, that's it). I cannot add, I cannot subtract.”If the vaccines were indeed given as a donation, Domingo said this still would have gone through the DOH’s Bureau of International Health Cooperation which coordinates with the FDA for the clearance of donated health products under normal circumstances. Government regulations likewise apply to official COVID-19 donations coming from foreign entities which undergo the verification process.Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the vaccines were indeed smuggled as it was unauthorized, but that it was “justified” since it is meant to protect the President. The defense chief said he did not know the source of the vaccines used and admitted he didn’t know how the smuggling issue “will be resolved” as the PSG violated FDA rules.
While Durante took the heat for the issue, he still did not disclose where or whom the doses were sourced from.

Why were health officials not consulted?
If the concern was to secure the President’s safety, was it enough to warrant bypassing the government’s own health officials?
The government’s own coronavirus task force formed a unique panel of vaccine experts under the Department of Science and Technology that was created specially to review potential COVID-19 vaccines.
The separate entity was supposed to provide an added layer of safety in evaluating vaccines developed during unprecedented circumstances, on top of an ad hoc group of experts at the FDA who were tapped as part of the process of issuing emergency use authorization.
Domingo said the DOH and the FDA – among the lead agencies in the vaccination efforts – had not been consulted on the use of a COVID-19 vaccine on PSG soldiers and top government officials.The agency was firm in its stand that the public should not be vaccinated yet because there are no registered vaccines subjected to FDA review.

FDA's balancing act: Probing unregistered vaccine used on soldiers, officials
How did it bypass FDA approval?
Even by Duterte’s own orders, a COVID-19 vaccine should have gone through proper regulatory processes before it could be used, let alone brought into the Philippines.The Chief Executive granted the FDA authority to issue special EUAs for the very purpose of ensuring timely access to safe COVID-19 medicines while the pandemic raged.Why the exception for a vaccine used by select officials?“I am as confused as you. I am also as bewildered because there is a process, there is a way for us to make sure that we can get the most amount of certainty when it comes to safety and efficacy of a vaccine,” Domingo said in an interview with ABS-CBN on December 28.In a separate briefing, he told reporters, “The fact is, there is no registered COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines at this time.”
If it was Sinopharm that was used, Roque downplayed the unknown risks, referring to China’s EUA for the vaccine and its use on hundreds of thousands outside traditional testing processes.Experts from HPAAC, the largest coalition of medical and health societies in the country, pointed out that an EUA from one country does not extend authority beyond its borders. Moreover, there is more to vaccines than simply receiving them.“Even if a vaccine is approved in other countries, its storage, transport, and distribution are complex procedures. Improper handling can damage vaccines and can render them useless,” the group said. “This is why distribution channels and processes need to be transparent and regulated.”
HPAAC counts among its member groups medical societies that earlier warned that the Philippines needed to recalibrate its response to the pandemic or see the country's health system overwhelmed. It counts some of the country's top medical experts and doctors as members.
What the law says
Each lapse that occurred in the unregulated vaccination of government workers raises the prospect that several laws have been violated.For the importation, distribution, and administration of an unregulated vaccine, the FDA Act of 2009 imposes a penalty of imprisonment and stiff fines that could reach millions of pesos.As it slipped pass health and Customs officials, those responsible for smuggling vaccines could face administrative and civil cases. The same goes for a “donation” of the coveted vaccine, which did not pass through proper government channels and may be subject to the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.On Monday, January 4, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra issued a written order directing the National Bureau of Investigation to probe the use of smuggled vaccines in the country.Guevarra did not zero in on the PSG but said it was important that laws on vaccine approval and administration were ""strictly observed for the benefit of everyone.""Aside from the FDA Act, Guevarra said the NBI is looking into possible violations of the Medical Practice Act of 1959 which holds liable individuals who “knowingly or willfully administer an unregistered vaccine.”While questions remain unanswered, among the casualties of the issue initially kept under wraps are frontliners and essential workers who have been told that they would be the first to receive the vaccine.The health department tried to assuage concerns.

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin says the countries are ‘turning anti-epidemic cooperation into a new highlight in bilateral relations’
China has vowed to prioritize the Philippines’ request for a coronavirus vaccine after President Rodrigo Duterte said in his 5th State of the Nation (SONA) that he pleaded with Chinese President Xi Jinping to place Manila as priority.“The Philippines is a friendly close neighbor and we will give priority to its needs once we succeed in developing a vaccine,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing on Tuesday, July 28.Duterte had also earlier spoken with Xi in a 20-minute phone call last June 11 where the Chinese President assured Duterte of China’s assistance in the coronavirus pandemic.On Tuesday, Wang reiterated Xi’s assurance, saying “Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China and the Philippines have been standing together with mutual assistance, turning anti-epidemic cooperation into a new highlight in bilateral relations.”Who gets a vaccine first?
With scientists around the world racing to find a cure to the coronavirus, experts warned of “vaccine nationalism” – or a “my country first” approach toward allocating vaccines. (READ: Why Duterte shouldn’t just wait for a vaccine from China)
In a Foreign Affairs article, analysts Thomas Bollyky and Chad Bown said that without global coordination or an “international, enforceable commitment” to distribute vaccines equitably, low- and middle-income countries will have a harder time gaining access to a long-awaited cure.“Supplies of proven vaccines will be limited initially even in some rich countries, but the greatest suffering will be in low- and middle-income countries. Such places will be forced to watch as their wealthier counterparts deplete supplies and will have to wait months (or longer) for their replenishment,” they said.The analysts likewise raised insights of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, who told the Wall Street Journal he expects China to use its vaccines “predominantly for the large populace of China.” China counts 1.4 billion people among its population, one of the largest in the world.Earlier in the pandemic, international relations observers noted that as the number of new coronavirus cases were decreasing in China – ground zero of the novel coronavirus – the country gained room to focus more resources on providing aid to other countries affected by the disease.In ramping up foreign assistance, however, experts noted that China's efforts were a way to deflect criticism over its handling of coronavirus cases in the crucial early days of the outbreak. The Philippines is looking to start Phase 3 clinical trials for 5 vaccines by October 2020. These include 3 candidate vaccines being developed in China.

'Wala kaming pakialam kung ano ang pipiliin 'nyo,' says the Philippine Chief Executive
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the national government will not tie down mayors and governors in choosing a particular COVID-19 vaccine for their constituents.
""I'm now addressing the mayors and governors, you can choose any vaccine you like to buy. Wala kaming pakialam kung ano ang pipiliin 'nyo (We don't care which one you'll choose),"" he said on Wednesday, January 13, during a meeting with pandemic task force officials at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse.
His promise comes amid successive announcements of cities signing deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca for hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses.
Duterte later on clarified that local governments would still have to choose from the COVID-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a national government agency.
""Maraming local government units who opted to go on their own. Sila ang magbili, may pera sila, and sila ang mamili ng kanilang vaccine.... And they insist to be given the freedom to choose because may pera sila,"" said Duterte.
(Many local government units opted to go on their own. They will buy because they have money, and they want to choose their vaccine.... And they insist to be given the freedom to choose because they have money.)
He then said the national government is ""not forcing"" any local government to adopt the vaccines to be patronized by the national government.
Chinese vs Western vaccines?
While local governments had signed deals with AstraZeneca, a few like Davao City, led by Duterte's daughter Sara, are also in talks with Chinese firm Sinovac.
The national government, however, has just signed a deal with Sinovac for 25 million doses of its vaccine, CoronaVac.
Duterte defended Chinese-made vaccines in the same meeting, saying they are ""as good"" as American- or European-made ones.
The Philippine leader has long expressed a preference for Chinese or Russian vaccines, with Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque even saying last Monday, January 11, that if Duterte had his way, he would get injected with both a Chinese and Russian vaccine.
The newly-signed Sinovac agreement means the Philippines has secured supplies of 3 vaccines – those of Sinovac, Novavax, and AstraZeneca – so far.
However, the FDA is yet to approve any vaccine for emergency use. Of the 3 secured vaccines, only AstraZeneca has applied for emergency use approval as of this writing. – Rappler.com",Rappler

The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 warns that allowing for such a setup could severely impact public health safety and lead to the inequitable rollout of vaccines in the Philippines
Several of the Philippines' top health experts on Thursday, February 11, opposed lawmakers' efforts to push for bills that would allow local government units (LGUs) to buy coronavirus vaccines directly from manufacturers.
The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) – the largest coalition of health groups in the country – warned that proposed measures seeking to grant LGUs this authority could severely impact the public health safety and rollout of vaccines in the country.It could also create unequal access to limited shots throughout the country, with prioritization of the coveted good defined by access to funds and the capacity to pay, instead of need based on exposure and risk to COVID-19.""This is not about money but justice – social justice,"" said Dr Aileen Espina, a public health and family medicine specialist, during a press conference on Thursday night.
Internal medicine specialist and epidemiologist Dr Antonio Dans, along with Dr Inday Dans, pediatrician and clinical epidemiologist, said the group was strongly opposed to the possible passage of Senate Bill No. 2042 filed by Senate Majority Leader Miguel Zubiri last February 8.
Dans appealed to lawmakers and Zubiri to reconsider the bill, saying it would impact the public's trust in the government's COVID-19 vaccination program.""This will impact public trust greatly, not just when it comes to effectiveness of vaccines but in their trust that no one will be left behind, people will be treated equally, and the country will move forward together,"" Dans said in Filipino.While the group focused on SB 2042, similar measures had been filed at the House of Representatives by Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez, House Minority Leader Stephen Paduano, as well as Quirino Representative Junie Cua.
The bigger picture
Lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have been pushing for measures that would allow LGUs and the private sector to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers, without the oversight of national government.
They argued that allowing for such purchase schemes would speed up access to vaccines in the country. This comes after they criticized the national government's supposed ""monopoly"" over purchase deals that hampered Filipinos' access to COVID-19 shots.
But health experts opposed such measures for 3 main reasons:First, that it would bypass the required recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC), which is mandated to review medical technology eyed for use in a public health program. The HTAC, created by the Universal Health Care Law, reviews the feasibility and cost-efficiency of health technology like vaccines for public use, as well as potential commercial or political conflicts of interest.
Second, it would lead to ""maldistribution"" of vaccines, where richer LGUs with the capacity to pay would get priority access to already limited vaccines, leaving poorer communities further behind.Third, patchwork purchasing of vaccines, as opposed to centralized purchase through the national government, would escalate vaccine prices ""because the country will lose the scale or volume that one buyer has.""
Dans said the HTAC's recommendation guaranteed public safety of vaccines as the group of independent scientists continuously reviewed vaccines to balance ""benefit, harm, and cost” that may shift quickly, ""even overnight,"" as more information on COVID-19 and vaccines were shared.
This recommendation is separate from the Food and Drug Administration's issuance of emergency approval, which focused only on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine.""Bypassing recommendations of this council will expose the people to the dangers of inappropriate technology, and may make local policy makers liable for wrong decisions,"" he said.Allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines on their own would also hamper goals of a vaccine program to reduce mortality and maintain healthcare capacity. They stressed that since supplies worldwide are limited, scarce shots should be given to those who need it most across the country: healthcare workers, elderly, and people with comorbidities.
Dans said: ""If there was no lack of vaccines, it would be acceptable, but with limited supplies, the scarce vaccines should be give to those who need it the most.... One problem of the pandemic is the poor are always shortchanged.""

As vaccine arrival nears, health experts ask Filipinos to ‘respect’ priority list
Granting LGUs the authority to buy vaccines on their own could also threaten proper allocation of funds, as the HPAAC pointed out that nearly half of the cost of immunization programs is spent on actually implementing the rollout of vaccines.
With doses already severely limited worldwide and developed countries having access to majority of vaccines produced, the HPAAC said allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines directly from manufacturers may see the same scenario of unequal distribution take place locally.""We aggravate this inequity by doing the same thing locally – distributing geographically according to capacity to pay. When this happens, we all suffer, not just those whom we push to the end of the queue,"" the group said.Dans said the group had presented its position to lawmakers at the Senate, but that discussions indicated preference for the bill to be passed despite its possible negative impact on the country's COVID-19 vaccination program.What works now
The HPAAC appealed to lawmakers to keep the current scheme where LGUs and the private sector buy vaccines along with the national government, since this would assure equal distribution and continuous safety.This setup would also comply with the FDA's conditions for use under an emergency use authorization (EUA), which allows for its public use under strict conditions.
While the proposed bills in Congress mentioned LGUs could only buy vaccines that have been granted an EUA by the FDA, the HPAAC pointed out that an EUA was still different from securing full marketing authority necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allow its sale in the market.Current purchase schemes involving LGUs and the private sector take the form of tripartite deals where the national government, through the National Task Force against COVID-19, signs deals with vaccine manufacturers and either LGUs or business groups.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had told lawmakers during previous congressional hearings that this allowed for LGUs and the private sector to take part in vaccine procurement – something unique to the Philippines, as vaccine manufacturers have so far preferred to deal directly with national governments only.According to Galvez, tripartite deals allow the Philippines to meet this condition of vaccine companies which they observed with all countries, especially as supplies of vaccines remain severely limited.
Galvez had also earlier told senators that allowing LGUs and private groups to directly buy COVID-19 vaccines was not yet possible. This was because ""no company"" would engage in deals that did not involve national governments of other countries, which have only been granting emergency use approvals to COVID-19 vaccines. – Rappler.com",Rappler

FDA Director General Eric Domingo also warns against supposed coronavirus vaccines that are being sold in the market, saying that these vaccines should not be promoted unless they are FDA-approved
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo announced on Friday, October 30, that Chinese company Clover Biopharmaceuticals has applied to conduct clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccine in the country.
(Editor's note: An earlier version of this report referred to Clover Biopharmaceuticals as an Australian company. This has been corrected.)
In a virtual press briefing on Friday morning, Domingo said that Clover has submitted its clinical trials data to the vaccine expert panel (VEP) for evaluation.
Domingo said he could not give more details about Clover as he only knew about its intent on Friday.
To date, at at least 3 companies expressed interest in conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines. Under such trials, a vaccine is given to hundreds of people split into different age groups.
Aside from Clover, health officials cited China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Sputnik V among candidate vaccines that could possibly see independent trials in the country.For Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine, the VEP is still evaluating data from phases 1 and 2 of its clinical trials. According to the New York Times’ vaccine tracker, this vaccine is a ""combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene.""
As for Sinovac, the VEP has endorsed this to the FDA. Domingo said the agency is anticipating the submission of its application for Phase 3 trials after it gets the endorsement of the ethics board.Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect one's health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use. (READ: What we know about the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccine plans)
In the Philippines, the FDA is the body tasked with regulating clinical trials.Domingo said that to date, no company has been given approval to conduct clinical trials in the country.

Illegal COVID-19 vaccines
During Friday's briefing, Domingo also warned the public against supposed coronavirus vaccines that are being sold in the market. He added that while the Philippines and other countries are doing clinical trials, these vaccines should not be promoted in the market unless they already secured FDA approval.
""We have to remember that even though may clinical trials na kahit na nagki-clinical trials na ang produkto sa Pilipinas at sa ibang bansa (there are clinical trials for products being done in the Philippines and other countries), and they are not registered, they cannot be promoted in the market as safe and effective, and definitely, they cannot be sold,"" Domingo said.
This came after reports that there have been Chinese advertisements promoting COVID-19 vaccines priced at P50,000.

The government allocates the first tranche of Pfizer vaccines for hospital-based healthcare workers
The Philippine pandemic task force has included persons with comorbidities in its list of priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination. Teachers and social workers, meanwhile, have been placed in the 2nd tier of prioritization.
The new list was made public on Friday, February 5, by Presidential Spokesman and task force spokesman Harry Roque.
The list was formulated by the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG), a team of health experts advising the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Here is the new list:
A1: Frontline workers in health facilities both national and local, private and public, health professionals and non-professionals like students, nursing aides, janitors, barangay health workers, etc.
A2: Senior citizens aged 60 years old and aboveA3: Persons with comorbidities not otherwise included in the preceding categoriesA4: Frontline personnel in essential sectors including uniformed personnel and those in working sectors identified by the IATF as essential during ECQA5: Indigent population not otherwise included in the preceding categories
B1: Teachers, social workersB2: Other government workersB3: Other essential workersB4: Socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigent peopleB5: Overseas Filipino WorkersB6: Other remaining workforceC: Rest of the Filipino population not otherwise included in the above groups
Health workers to get Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine
The task force also said it is allocating the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, expected to arrive this month, for health frontliners.
The first tranche will be given to frontliners in the following health facilities:
COVID-19 dedicated hospitals
COVID-19 referral hospitals
Hospitals owned by the Department of Health
Local government hospitals
Hospitals for uniformed services or personnel
Private hospitals
The Pfizer vaccines arriving in February are coming in through the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility. The Philippines was able to qualify for the mechanism's early vaccine roll-out, intended to give developing countries affordable, equitable access to COVID-19 jabs.
Changing minds
In the first priority list released to the public, persons with comorbidities were not in the first tier of the list, which was dominated by health frontliners, senior citizens, and indigent Filipinos.
The World Health Organization has identified those with heart or lung disease, diabetes, or conditions affecting their immune system as ""high-risk"" because they are more likely to experience a severe COVID-19 infection.
Some members of the task force, including Roque, had argued for including persons with comorbidities but the idea was initially thumbed down.
""The other camp was saying, anyway most senior citizens with comorbidities already have priority,"" said Roque last January 11.
But another reason given for not including persons with comorbidities is that it would supposedly allow more people a chance to skip the line.
""There was some discussion because some are mistrustful, that it might be a loophole used by some to get ahead, even if they don't have [comorbidities],"" said Roque.
Meanwhile, the new list does not include families of military personnel, despite President Rodrigo Duterte's promise in a speech in front of soldiers in Sulu.
Prioritization based on area
The task force, meanwhile, said it would prioritize geographic areas that have both high transmission rates and readiness to roll out vaccines.
The criteria is as follows:
COVID-19 burden of disease (current active cases, attack rate per 100,000 population in the past 4 weeks, population density)
readiness of local government unit or vaccination site, particularly its supply chain capability

'But somebody dropped the ball,' tweets Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr
As the Philippines struggles to secure enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said on Tuesday, December 15, that an offer was made to secure the country 10 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine for as early as January 2021.But the arrangement supposedly fell through, Locsin said, as “somebody dropped the ball” on the possible purchase of the vaccine facilitated by Locsin and Philippine Ambassador to the United State Jose “Babe” Romualdez with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.“That said my thanks just the same to US Sec of State Mike Pompeo we – Babe Romualdez and I – got 10 million doses of Pfizer financed by World Bank and ADB to be shipped thru FEDEX to Clark in January. But somebody dropped the ball,” Locsin tweeted on Tuesday.Locsin did not disclose further details when asked who was responsible for the missed opportunity. The foreign affairs chief instead said Philippine vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr was already ordering doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, which has been the first to be used in countries that have started their mass vaccination campaigns against the disease.In a briefing at Malacañang earlier on Tuesday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said he had “no idea” who Locsin was referring to.Despite this, Roque denied the government failed to act early in securing supplies of Pfizer’s vaccine, citing as proof Locsin’s negotiations with Pompeo.“Alam ko po maaga pa nakipag-negotiate na po si Secretary Locsin dahil naaalala ko po iyang meeting na iyan pero maagang-maaga pa po in 2020 nakipag-negotiate na po si Secretary Locsin. Hindi lang nakipag-negotiate, nakipagkasundo pa na bibigyan tayo ng Amerika ng Pfizer,” Roque said.(I know Secretary Locsin negotiated earlier on since I remember that meeting and it was early in 2020 when Secretary Locisn was negotiating. Not just negotiating, but had agreed that America would give us Pfizer vaccines.)
Locsin likewise brushed aside notion the Philippines failed to act fast enough to secure supplies of a vaccine.“No. We did not miss the bus because we were slow to act. Babe and I were fast. Offers poured in. But there are none so slow as those who never had the intention to catch the bus,” he said.While negotiations were ongoing between Pfizer officials and the government, no purchase of a specific number of doses have been announced. Galvez earlier said the country remained in talks with the company but declined to give details as it was now covered by a confidentiality agreement.Health officials earlier said President Rodrigo Duterte approved the government’s pre-payment for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.MUST READ

'Requirements and standard agreements are common to all countries. They're not specific to the Philippines, and they are not related to...Dengvaxia,' says WHO Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.
World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe denied the Philippines was being asked for specific requirements in its indemnification agreement with vaccine firm Pfizer due to the Dengvaxia dengue controversy.This is contrary to claims made by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr who earlier said that arrest warrants issued in relation to the Dengvaxia scandal in the Philippines impacted the government’s negotiation efforts with manufacturers.Galvez attributed the delay in vaccine procurement to the Dengvaxia issue. He told reporters, “The situation changed. We have to understand. What happened with the warrants of arrest for Sanofi, it has great implications on our procurement, really.” He added that the arrest warrants announced last February 1 “changed everything.”But In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, February 23, Abeyasinghe clarified the Philippines was instead asked to sign onto a “standard” indemnification agreement similar to those presented to different countries receiving the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.“Let me clarify that the requirements and standard agreements are common to all countries. They're not specific to the Philippines, and they are not related to any issue that happened in the country relating to Dengvaxia or anything else,” he said when asked if the Philippines was being asked for special indemnity requirements.
Abeyasinghe made the statement after the rollout of the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccination had been delayed due to paperwork on indemnification agreements required by manufacturers as vaccines are still under emergency use authorization worldwide.The Philippines earlier targeted to start its vaccination campaign by February 2021, with initial doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine supplied by the WHO’s COVAX facility.What's the status of delivery now?
Abeyasinghe said the issues raised between Pfizer and the Philippine government included the need for an indemnification law in the Philippines as well as “several minor clauses” in a letter detailing indemnification requirements.Philippine lawmakers were seeking to address the need for legislation on indemnification with the passage of bills creating an indemnification fund for adverse events following immunization. The House of Representatives passed its version of the measure on Monday, February 23, while the Senate passed a counterpart bill on Tuesday.As to requirements listed in a letter between the Philippines and Pfizer, the WHO said Philippine officials received documents on these details Tuesday morning.“So maybe today or tomorrow we will see a resolution of that impasse and maybe there'll be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe said.As for initial AstraZeneca doses coming from the COVAX facility, Abeyasinghe said the Department of Health had supplied “all letters necessary” to access supplies part of an early rollout of the vaccine. AstraZeneca, he added, did not require a further exchange of letters on the indemnification requirement.Abeyasinghe said the WHO remained optimistic it would pin down an initial date of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for the Philippines this week with doses to be sourced from those manufactured in South Korea.Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca have secured emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration with first doses to be given to frontline health workers in 32 hospitals across Manila, along with two more in Cebu City and Davao City.As more countries across the region started the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines among their populations, health workers and local officials tasked with distributing vaccines said they were ready to start vaccinating people by the government’s targeted February rollout.

Kumaran said discussions are ongoing as Bharat Biotech awaits emergency use authorization (EUA) for Covaxin, its COVID-19 vaccine, from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

“There are ongoing conversations for a supply for Covaxin which can range anywhere from 8 million doses upwards. I don’t think we are in a position to be signing anything yet,” he said in an ANC interview.

Kumaran clarified that formal negotiations have not yet begun as Bharat Biotech only submitted its Phase 3 clinical trial data to the FDA on Tuesday.

“The company has had one or two presentations with the FDA, but the commercial negotiations, which involve signing of a term sheet and then eventually moving to a contract, those are still pending,” he said.

“Once we close the contract, the nature of the vaccine requires at least 45 days for the production to be completed. We could look at 8 to 20 million over the next year and a half, but how much of that will come early is actually the big question,” he added.

Bharat Biotech filed an application for EUA on January 21.

Covaxin showed 81% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19.

Blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine neutralized an engineered version of the virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike portion of the highly contagious P.1 variant first identified in Brazil, the study conducted by scientists from the companies and the University of Texas Medical Branch found.
The scientists said the neutralizing ability was roughly equivalent the vaccine's effect on a previous less contagious version of the virus from last year.
The spike, used by the virus to enter human cells, is the primary target of many COVID-19 vaccines.
In previously published studies, Pfizer had found that its vaccine neutralized other more contagious variants first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, although the South African variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the vaccine.

Researchers tracked vaccine responses in 11 survivors of mild COVID-19 and 33 never-infected individuals.
In everyone, the vaccines induced the immune system to produce antibodies along with so-called B cells that remember the virus and remain ready to produce new antibodies to fight it, although the magnitude of the B cell response was lower in older people.
Those not previously infected ""benefited from both doses,"" with additional antibody and memory B cell increases after the second shot, researchers reported on Saturday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
COVID-19 survivors, however, had significant responses to the first dose with no increase in antibodies or memory B cells after the second dose.

Survivors' levels of memory B cells before vaccination correlated strongly with their antibody levels post vaccination, ""indicating that these B cells were the likely source"" of survivors' boosted antibody levels after just a single shot, said coauthor John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania.
This suggests memory B cells will play important roles if antibody levels fall over time, he added. Because memory B cells can be the source of new antibodies with some degree of ""adaptability,"" they might play a role in immunity to variant viruses, he speculated. -- Reuters",GMA News

Variant in Brazil more likely to reinfect survivors
A coronavirus variant circulating in Brazil is likely able to reinfect people who survived infections with earlier versions of the coronavirus, new data suggest.
The variant that emerged in Brazil, called P.1, carries a mutation that is already known to make a variant prevalent in South Africa harder to treat with antibodies and harder to prevent with available vaccines.
New data suggest that in many recovered patients, immunity to earlier versions of the virus will not afford immunity to P.1.

Researchers tested the neutralizing ability of antibodies in plasma samples taken from survivors of COVID-19 caused by earlier versions of the virus.
The plasma ""had 6-fold less neutralizing capacity"" against the P.1 variant than against earlier virus versions, the researchers reported on Monday ahead of peer-review on a preprint server belonging to The Lancet journal.
""Lower neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and partial immunity against new variants suggests that reinfection could occur in convalescent or even vaccinated individuals,"" the authors said.
In a separate paper posted on Wednesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, some of the same researchers estimated that among every 100 survivors of COVID-19 due to earlier virus versions, 25-to-60 could become reinfected if exposed to the P.1 variant because their antibodies could not protect them.
As of Thursday, according to the US Centers for Disease Control of Prevention, there have been 13 cases of COVID-19 due to P.1 in the United States.
COVID-19 vaccine antibodies pass into breast milk
COVID-19 antibodies induced by vaccines from Pfizer Inc/BioNTech and Moderna Inc can pass into breast milk, a small study suggests, although it is not clear yet how long the antibodies will be present.
Six breastfeeding mothers who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines provided researchers with milk samples before and after vaccination, with the last sample collected two weeks after the second shot.
None of the women had been infected with the coronavirus.
A week after the first shot, all of the women had COVID-19 antibodies in their breast milk.
Antibody levels fell slightly afterward and then sharply increased after the second shot.
The two vaccines were similarly effective in inducing the antibodies, although antibody levels varied from woman to woman, the research team reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
""Further research is needed on the longevity of the antibody response in breast milk, as well as the magnitude and duration of effect on infant immunity to the virus,"" the researchers said. -- Reuters",GMA News

The emergence of variants of the new coronavirus has raised concern that vaccines and treatments that were developed based on previous strains may not work as robustly.
Plasma samples taken from eight people vaccinated with Sinovac's CoronaVac failed to efficiently neutralize the P.1 lineage variant, or 20J/501Y.V3, researchers said in a paper published on Monday ahead of peer-review.
""These results suggest that P.1 virus might escape from neutralizing antibodies induced by... CoronaVac,"" researchers at the University of São Paulo in Brazil, Washington University School of Medicine in the United States, and a few other institutions said in the paper.
CoronaVac is being used in mass vaccination drives in countries including China, Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey.

Although the study suggests re-infection may occur in vaccinated individuals, the protection given by CoronaVac against severe COVID-19 may indicate other mechanisms in the human immune system, aside from antibodies, may also contribute to reducing disease severity, researchers said.
A Sinovac spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

“We actually don’t agree with it, that it is ‘sayang lang’ or that it is ineffective. In fact, we also agree with the WHO position,” David said.
Earlier, a WHO official maintained that the AstraZeneca vaccine is still effective even in areas with widespread transmission of the South Africa variant, noting that the study showing otherwise only had a “very small sample” of less than 2,000 patients. 
David also pointed out that the evidence Austriaco cited came from “just one study.”

Abeyansinghe said that the arrival of the vaccines in the country is a “testament to the strength of collaboration, cooperation, and compassion.”
“It is a testament to the power of working together towards a common goal in the spirit of partnership, equity, and solidarity,” he said.
Meanwhile, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) said the pandemic has become a child rights crisis that must be ended as fast as possible.
“The longer the pandemic goes on, the more intense the impact on people, especially on children’s health, rights to education, nutrition, protection, and mental health,” UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov said in a statement.
“COVID-19 vaccination should be part of a larger strategy to strengthen health systems for children and families in the Philippines for the long-term,” she added.
President Rodrigo Duterte personally welcomed the arrival of the vaccines at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on Thursday evening.
Also present in the event was Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles.
Officials earlier said that there was still no date for the rollout of AstraZeneca vaccine pending experts' recommendation on which sector would best benefit from the doses.

“Sa akin, Sinopharm [ang gusto ko]. Hindi ako masyado sa produkto ng mga puti,” Duterte said.
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, jointly developed by American giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech, was the first to get emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA last January 14.
The government has initially said it is reserving 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from the COVAX facility to health workers, and that the shipment would arrive by mid-February. This timeline has since been scuttled over changing  reasons for their delayed arrival, ranging from lack of a indemnification law to logistical problems.
Ultimately, 600,000 doses of Sinovac donated by the Chinese government to the Philippines arrived in the country on February 28—the first legal shipment of COVID-19 vaccines to be delivered to the country.
Less than 24 hours after Sinovac’s delivery, the country started its COVID-19 vaccination rollout with health workers getting the first Sinovac jab.

“We still believe that the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective even in places where you have a large proportion of cases which could be attributed to the B.1.351 or the South Africa variant,” he said in a virtual briefing.
A molecular biologist on Wednesday warned that the AstraZeneca shot could be rendered ineffective if the Philippines fails to curb the spread of the South Africa variant.

Ho said a similar study on childhood vaccination conducted two years ago also found that health workers influence public confidence in inoculation.

“A worker can be late for work and be penalized with salary deduction. But a government guilty of vaccine tardiness faces no such reprimand, even if it causes the nation P2.8 billion in economic losses daily,” Villanueva said.
“A worker who is not yet immune from the virus shouldn't lose his immunity from being fired arbitrarily,"" he added.

“The biggest challenge at the moment for the labor-employer-government tripartite is not just to give more workers better vaccines but also to increase vaccine confidence,” Villanueva said.
""Sa pagbabakuna, the best pa rin po ang 'Sana All.' We cannot have a workforce divided between the ‘Jabbed’ and the ‘Jabbed Nots,'"" he added.
Several groups have opposed the supposed plan of some companies to impose a ""no vaccine, no work"" policy.
Some workers have reportedly approached the Associated Labor Union as early as last year expressing their concern over a warning by employers that their company will implement a ""no vaccine, no work"" policy.
Villanueva said workers should not be faulted for refusing to be vaccinated if they still have concerns on the vaccine to be used on them.
The challenge for the government now is to increase the public's level of confidence on the vaccines, he added.
""There has to be a concerted effort to bring up the degree of trust on vaccines because the restoration of jobs lost in the pandemic, and to a larger extent, our economic recovery, depend on the success of the vaccination program,” Villanueva said.
“If it is a brand even doctors are rejecting, you can understand where the hesitancy is coming from,” he added.

The government plans to purchase one million Sinovac doses this month to augment the 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government.
Doctors from the Philippine General Hospital as well as Vice President Leni Robredo earlier called for an HTAC review of the Sinovac jab to ensure “informed decision-making.”
Duque maintained that the law does not mandate an HTAC evaluation for donated vaccines.
“In the first place, the safety efficacy evaluation is the mandate of the FDA. So the HTAC is really an economic tool to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the vaccines. But because this is not to be procured, the FDA evaluation of risk-benefit analysis suffices,” he said.
The HTAC has already cleared the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines, millions of doses of which will be donated to the Philippines by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility.
“The difference is AstraZeneca and Pfizer had submitted their trial data much earlier and these trial data were published in journals so there was time for HTAC to do it,” Duque said.
Dr. Ernesto Domingo, a Ramon Magsaysay Awardee and a professor at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine, for his part, said that the Sinovac vaccine does not need an HTAC appraisal before it could be given to healthcare workers in accordance with the Universal Healthcare Law.
""No, my answer is you don't need the HTAC to go over this for the vaccine to be given. So I agree, the rollout, it should continue,"" said  at a Palace briefing.
""It's all there. We know what it is supposed to do, what it can do, what we have to be aware of,"" Domingo added, saying other international bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), have given their approval for Sinovac.
""When it comes to our place, our own FDA (Food and Drug Administration) said 'Yes you can use it.' I don't see any reason why it should be subjected to HTAC discussion,"" Domingo said.

“What’s more important to me is the seal of approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If it’s approved by the FDA, which went through tedious analysis prior to the grant of authorization for emergency use, I’m okay with it,"" Gatchalian said.
""I’m okay with any brand of anti-COVID-19 vaccine. I’m not brand conscious. I put my trust in the FDA,” he added.
A total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, just about a week after the FDA granted it emergency use authorization.
FDA director general Dr. Eric Domingo said Sinovac’s efficacy ranged from 65.3% to 91.2% but only reached 50.4% among health workers with COVID-19 exposure.
This makes it not recommended for health workers, he added.
“This should be administered by vaccination providers and to prevent COVID-19 in clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old,” Domingo had said.
However, Domingo clarified on Tuesday that health workers can still choose to get vaccinated with Sinovac since they merely made a recommendation on which groups it is not suited for.
Prior to the vaccination drive on Monday, a nationwide survey conducted by OCTA Research group showed that only 19% of adult Filipinos want to get a COVID-19 vaccine while 46% said they do not want to be vaccinated against the illness.
But Gatchalian believes this could change as more and more Filipinos will likely to receive Sinovac COVID-19 shots in the coming days.

This was stated in the copy of the law released by the Palace on Monday afternoon but was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte last February 26.
The measure reads, “public officials and employees, contractors, manufacturers, volunteers and representatives of duly authorized private entities who are duly authorized to carry out and are actually carrying out the COVID-19 vaccination program will be immune for suit and liability under Philippine laws with respect to all claims arising out of, related to, or resulting from the administration or use of a COVID-19 vaccine under the COVID-19 vaccination program except arising willful misconduct and gross negligence.”
Likewise, the measure provides for a P500 million indemnity fund for the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) which would enable the state-run health insurance firm to grant financial compensation in case of death, permanent disability, or hospital confinement of an individual who was inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine.
The same measure also mandates the Department of Health to issue a COVID-19 vaccine card, subject to the provisions of the Data Privacy Act.

On Sunday, China’s donation of 600,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses from Sinovac arrived at the Villamor Airbase on a Chinese Y-20 Transporter aircraft.

Earlier in the day, University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi became the Philippines' first official recipient of a CoronaVac against COVID-19.
Several government officials, including vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Food and Drug Administration director general Eric Domingo, and testing czar Secretary Vince Dizon also received the Sinovac shot.
Meanwhile, Yang recommended that the second dose of the Sinovac shot should be taken after 14 to 28 days.

A vaccine needs to secure an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for it to be legally administered in the Philippines.
Sinopharm has yet to apply for an EUA before the FDA.
The FDA, however, can allow the use of the vaccine without EUA approval provided that the vaccine secured a compassionate use permit.
The issuance of compassionate use permit, however, does not amount to stamp of approval from the FDA.
Smuggled vaccines
Roque earlier said that the President prefers to be inoculated with a Sinopharm vaccine.
Former broadcaster Mon Tulfo, who has served as the country’s special envoy to China, has revealed that he, some senators and Cabinet members had received their two doses of smuggled Sinopharm vaccine in October 2020 and that Duterte also wanted to have the Sinopharm jab.
Roque could not say if Tulfo’s claims that the President wanted the same vaccine for his family members were true.
Nevertheless, Roque assured the public on Monday that the President will take his COVID-19 vaccine in public view.
“It will be in public, and you will be informed if there will be side effects on the President,” he said.
Roque, however, clarified that the Constitutional provision requiring disclosure of the President’s health condition has limits.
“Ang sinasabi po sa Konstitusyon, iyong kailangang sabihin ay seryosong pagkakasakit lamang,” Roque said.
Presidential Security Group commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III admitted in December 2020 that they got vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also received a shot of Sinovac's vaccine at the PGH.
The ceremony -- one among several symbolic vaccinations scheduled within the day -- was held in a bid to boost public confidence in the vaccination program in light of polls showing low trust in vaccines.  
Several government officials, including Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Eric Domingo and testing czar Secretary Vince Dizon also received the Sinovac shot. Dizon received his at Tala Hospital (Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium) in Caloocan City.
Under the vaccination priority list, frontline workers in health facilities should be the first to get inoculated. 
The “symbolic” vaccination followed the arrival of 600,000 Sinovac doses on Sunday afternoon. 
The first batch of vaccines will be rolled out to several hospitals in Metro Manila also on Monday, marking a turning point in the country’s battle against COVID-19.
Aside from PGH, the priority hospitals for vaccination are the Lung Center of the Philippines, Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium (Tala Hospital), PNP General Hospital, Pasig City General Hospital, and the V. Luna Medical Center.
Only 180 of the 1,165 surveyed at the Tala Hospital expressed interest in the Sinovac vaccine. The hospital chief said a contingency plan is in place to avoid wastage.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and Galvez are set to receive Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine shots on Monday morning to boost public confidence in the vaccine, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go said Sunday.
Prior to the expected arrival of the vaccines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines emergency use authorization (EUA).
“Ito po ay isang pagpapatunay na ang lahat ng mga bakuna na ating ituturok sa ating mga kababayan ay ligtas at epektibo,” Galvez said.
""Kaya’t hinihikayat po namin ang ating mga kababayang Pilipino na magparehistro na sa kanilang mga barangay at upang kayo ay makapagpabakuna na,” he added.
Healthcare workers
The PGH Physicians' Association, however, said the Sinovac vaccine should undergo further appraisal by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) before being administered to healthcare workers.
The association said the expected administration of the Sinovac vaccine at PGH was met with a “sweeping disapproval rate of 95 percent” among the hospital's residents and fellows.
Although Sinovac was given EUA by the FDA, it was not recommended for healthcare workers due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4% for the group.
Still, the Department of Health has said the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group has agreed to recommend Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccines for health workers.
“We recognize the efforts of the PGH Administration in hastening the vaccination process for its constituents. However, the vaccination plan should have been handled with more prudence and transparency,” the PGH Physicians' Association said.
“As the national university hospital, PGH should set an example on how vaccination rollout should be executed in the country. PGH should uphold the ideals of ethical and evidence-based medicine, for which it has been a bastion of,” it added.
Indemnity fund
Last Friday, Duterte also signed into law the Vaccination Program Act of 2021 which would expedite the rollout of the country's vaccination program against COVID-19.
The measure also provides a P500-million indemnity fund for individuals who will experience adverse effects after getting the jab.
Galvez welcomed the passage of the law, saying that it would provide flexibility and indemnity in the procurement and administration of the vaccines.

Antibodies to the six coronaviruses that cause common colds cannot ""neutralize"" the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but antibodies to two of them might at least help the body fend off severe illness from the new virus, a small preliminary study suggests.
German researchers studied 60 patients with COVID-19, including 25 who were hospitalized but not critically ill, 19 who required intensive care unit admission, and 25 who did not get sick enough to be hospitalized.
The patients who needed intensive care all had significantly lower levels of antibodies to two seasonal coronaviruses, HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1, which the authors said are more closely related to the COVID-19 virus compared to the other human coronaviruses.

While the observation does not prove these antibodies are responsible, ""it is remarkable that the effect of HCoV OC43 and HKU1-specific antibody levels reached statistical significance regarding the need for intensive care therapy"" in such a small study, the researchers said in a paper published on Tuesday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.
""Further studies should validate this finding and explore the potential to identify persons at risk for severe disease course before a SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" they said.
Vaccine side effects may affect mammograms
Routine mammograms should be done either before the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or four-to-six weeks after the second dose, the Society for Breast Imaging advises.
The vaccines' temporary side effects can include swollen lymph nodes around the armpits, which could be misread as a possible sign of breast cancer if it turns up on a mammogram.
So-called axillary lymphadenopathy is usually seen in only 0.02%-0.04% of screening mammograms, according to the Society's guidelines.
In trials of the Moderna vaccine, the condition developed in 11.6% of participants after the first dose and in 16% after the second dose.
Researchers testing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine did not routinely ask participants about armpit tenderness and lymph node swelling, but some people reported this side effect, which lasted an average of 10 days.
More subtle effects on lymph nodes that are evident only on X-rays are likely to last longer, the Society said, although it is not clear yet what vaccination-related lymph node changes would look like.
""As more information about the incidence and appearance of axillary lymphadenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination becomes available, it may be appropriate to change the duration of follow-up or final assessment recommendations,"" the Society said. -- Reuters",GMA News

Galvez said three more agreements on COVID-19 vaccines were being polished in terms of indemnity provisions to ensure compensation for individuals who develop serious side effects.
“Actually, ‘yun talaga ang medyo tedious kasi talagang ang gusto po talaga ng ibang mga manufacturer full blanket,"" Galvez said in the weekly briefing chaired by President Rodrigo Duterte.
""Absolution?"" Duterte asked. ""Opo, kasama po doon,"" Galvez said.

“Dapat malaman po ng mamayan at saka ng mga manufacturers na this state cannot waive ‘yung tinatawag na blanket immunity na ang ano po natin na malpractices atsaka willful neglect,” Galvez said.
“Kasi unfair po sa atin na sa isang manufacturer na isu-surrender po natin ‘yun dahil parang pag ka… may mangyari na meron silang malpractices, parang kawawa naman po ‘yung ating mamayan na talagang mahihirapan na makapag-ano po ng indemnity,” he added.
The Senate has approved on second and third reading the measure seeking to expedite the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines and establish a vaccine P500-million indemnity fund.
The House of Representatives has adopted the Senate measure.
Even with an indemnity fund, however,  Galvez said negotiations should be fair.
“Dapat fair and square sa negotiation table. It is fair for us na dapat ilaban natin sa manufacturer na kailangan fair din po sila na kailangan i-maintain din po nila ‘yung specification na required na de-deliver nila sa vaccine is safe and effective,” Galvez said.

Roque was responding to the claim of the Philippines’ special envoy to China Mon Tulfo that the President wants to get a Sinopharm vaccine but was advised against it by government officials, including vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr.
“Gusto po talaga niya Sinopharm,” Roque said during the Palace briefing.
“Eh kaso nga, wala pa pong EUA, kaya ayaw noong mga doktor, mga eksperto,” he added.
EUA is emergency use authorization issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which is needed for a vaccine to be legally administered in the country.

Having an EUA means the FDA is guaranteeing that such COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo also said on Wednesday that Sinopharm, a Chinese COVID-19 vaccine, has yet to apply for an EUA. 
“Wala pa pong application sa 'min,” Domingo said during the Laging Handa briefing. 
“Hindi po namin hinaharang [ang application ng Sinopharm for EUA],” he added.
The FDA however approved the compassionate use of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for the benefit of Presidential Security Group (PSG) members, the Palace said last week. It was Duterte who first revealed in December 2020 that members of the military and the PSG already got vaccinated with the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine even if the FDA had yet to issue either an EUA or a permit for compassionate use for this vaccine at that time. PSG commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III confirmed the President’s statement, even saying that they inoculated themselves with the unregistered Sinopharm vaccine.
Roque, however, did not categorically deny Tulfo’s claim that the President had talked to a Sinopharm representative identified as John Boja because the Chief Executive wants to secure their vaccine.
“I am not belying Mon Tulfo. That is his article (The Manila Times column),” Roque said.

Under the measure, the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) are authorized to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.
It also allows local government units to procure COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through multiparty agreements.
Moreover, a COVID-19 National Indemnity Fund, to be administered by PhilHealth, will also be established under the measure to compensate any inoculated person who will experience permanent disability, hospital confinement, or death.
A P500 million will be authorized to augment the funds of PhilHealth for this purpose, to be sourced from the contingent fund under the 2021 General Appropriations Act.
Zubiri said that with the passage of the measure, the job of procuring the COVID-19 vaccines is now in the hands of the executive branch.
""We are not remiss in our job as legislators. Ginawa na natin ang lahat. Ang bola ay nasa korte na ng ehekutibo,"" he said.
""So we hope now there will be no hindrance to the coming of the vaccines and the implementation of the rollout,"" he added.

Expert answers,JOVILAND RITA,2021-02-23 16:37:00,"A health expert on Tuesday addressed several myths and misconceptions, and also provided advice, on COVID-19 vaccinations.
In a forum organized by the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP) and Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Kathryn Uy Roa said that COVID-19 vaccines were not for everyone.
“This is a fact,” Roa added.
However, she emphasized that the only contraindications against the vaccines were allergic reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine and any of its components.
Patients who experienced an immediate allergic reaction, whether mild like rashes or severe like anaphylaxis, to a vaccine's first dose should not receive the second dose.

“Myth No. 2: ‘I have allergies to other vaccines and injectable medications, therefore I cannot get the vaccine.’ So this is false. You need further evaluation by an allergist,” said Roa.
Those who had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injected therapy should be evaluated by an allergist to assess possible allergic reactions to some components of COVID-19 vaccines.
For people with allergies to food and medication, Roa said that they can receive COVID-19 vaccines.
“’I have allergies to food and or medication, therefore I cannot get the COVID-19 vaccines.’ So this is false. These are the special groups who can receive the COVID-19 vaccines.”
Roa added that patients suffering from immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases as well as well-controlled asthma may also get a COVID-19 vaccine.
Pregnant
“’I'm pregnant, therefore I cannot get the COVID-19 vaccines.’ This issue needs to be discussed with a doctor. There's very limited data on the effect of vaccines on pregnant women and their babies,” she said.
Roa noted that no safety concerns were flagged in the small group of women included in the vaccine trials as well as in animal studies.
She advised pregnant women to consider the following in deciding whether or not to get vaccinated against COVID-19:
level of COVID-19 community transmission
patient’s personal risk of contracting COVID-19
risk of COVID-19 to the parent and potential risks to the fetus
efficacy of the vaccine
side effects of the vaccines
lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy.
For lactating mothers, Roa said that there was limited data on the matter but the vaccine without a live virus was unlikely to pose a risk to a breastfeeding child.
The World Health Organization did not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding among mothers who received a vaccine. — DVM, GMA News",GMA News

The vaccine’s efficacy rate among healthy individuals aged 18 to 59, meanwhile, ranges from 65.3% to 91%.
“Our understanding is that there may have been some information that was shared with the FDA in the Philippines that made it necessary for the Philippines’ FDA to decide on this limited use of vaccines in the 18 to 59 year age group,” Abeyasinghe said.

“In the absence of clear information that WHO can access, we would leave it to the Philippines’ FDA and the Philippine government to prioritize… until the WHO emergency use listing is complete and we have clear evidence of what its efficacy is in different age groups where we can have a clear position,” he said.

Roque made the remark when reporters pressed him on the arrival date of COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines after the delay.
“Alam niyo po talagang ang sinabi sa atin ng COVAX facility eh darating yung kanilang Pfizer  eh dapat sa gitna ng Pebrero. Pero naantala nga po bakit?

Roque mistakenly referred to Dengvaxia maker Sanofi Pasteur and not Pfizer, which he later corrected.
“Kaya humihingi sila ng indemnity agreement dahil ang kanilang bakuna ay covered ng EUA (emergency use authorization), at hindi pa ng general use authorization. Gumalaw naman po ang ating pamahalaan, ang Kongreso ay bumubuo ng isang batas na nagsasabi na gobyerno na ang magbabayad ng danyos para sa lahat ng magkakaroon ng side effects.

The Dengvaxia controversy started in November 2017 when Sanofi-Pasteur announced that their vaccine posed a risk to those who were not infected by dengue prior to being injected with the vaccine.
However, the announcement only came after the vaccine had been administered to over 700,000 children and even policemen.
At least 100 vaccinated individuals have died of unconfirmed causes after receiving Dengvaxia doses, and health officials have ruled that that fatalities cannot be directly linked to the vaccine.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Sanofi returned P1.16 billion to the Department of Health for the unused doses of vaccine.
In correcting himself, Roque still insisted that Pfizer is seeking indemnity for its COVID-19 vaccines because of Sanofi-Pasteur’s Dengvaxia experience.
“Lilinawin ko, mukhang mali ang sinabi ko kanina. Ang manufacturer ng dengvaxia ay Sanofi hindi Pfizer. Pero alam nyo po puro Europeans yan naguusap-usap po yan. Kaya nga po parang naging mas maingat ang Pfizer bilang isang kapwa European manufacturer ng Sanofi pagdating sa pagsusuplay ng EUA,” Roque added.
However, Pfizer is an American company, and not European.
Later, Roque said that COVID-19 vaccines, which are approved for emergency use, are not similar to Dengvaxia that had been approved for general use.
“Uulitin ko po ang sinabi ng mga dalubhasa. Sinabi ni dating [Health] Secratary [Esperanza] Cabral, ang Dengvaxia po eh dumaan sa proseso, hindi lang sa Pilipinas kung hindi sa buong mundo at sa WHO (World Health Organization). Ito ay binigyan ng GUA (general use authorization) hindi lang po EUA, at ito po ay desisyon ng WHO at ng lahat ng dalubhasa sa daigdig na ligtas ang Dengvaxia para gamitin sa dengue,” Roque said.
“Pero ang nangyari dito sa Pilipinas, hindi pa naman napapatunayan na ang mga namatay dahil sa Dengvaxia. Nagkaroon lang ng pagkatakot, kaya nga po ngayon umaapela kami: unang una Pilipinas pakinggan po natin ang mga dalubhasa, epidemiologist, specialista, mga vaccinologist at lahat naman sila nagsasabi na bagamat EUA, eh mas marami ‘yung benepisyo na makukuha natin sa mga bakuna laban sa COVID-19 kaysa dun sa kanilang posibleng mga side effects,” Roque added. —GMA News",GMA News

The statement was issued after the World Health Organization (WHO) approved two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 for emergency use and are available for global distribution.
COVAX also said that in order for the doses to be delivered via the first allocation round, the following critical pieces must be in places:
All facility participants must have given national regulatory authorization for the vaccines in question, a process which can be expedited by issuing special authorizations for use based on granting of WHO Emergency Use Listing.
All facility participants must have signed indemnity agreements with the manufacturers in question in order to receive doses through COVAX.
Advance Market Commitment-eligible economies must have submitted National Deployment and Vaccination Plans through the COVID-19 Partners Platform, that have then been reviewed and validated by COVAX.
COVAX said the bulk of the first round of deliveries can be expected in March.

But for those who have already fulfilled the said criteria, the shipment of may be done by late February.
“As participants fulfil the criteria and finalize readiness preparations, COVAX will issue purchase orders to the manufacturer and ship and deliver doses via an iterative process. This means deliveries for this first round of allocation will take place on a rolling basis and in tranches,” it said.
“Due the high number of doses available as well as the high number of countries getting ready for delivery in Q1 2021, the capacity of supplier and freight forwarders will be under considerable pressure. Shipment timelines will be impacted by logistical preparedness and delivery lead times, which may vary depending on the location of the receiving participant,” it added.
The WHO earlier said the Philippines’ indemnity plan is now in the hands of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Pfizer.
The COVAX Facility is expected to send more than 100,000 doses of Pfizer BioNTech vaccines to the country once the firm signs off on the Philippines indemnification measures.
The country's lack of an indemnification law—a measure ensuring compensation for individuals who develop serious side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine—has delayed the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Philippines.
At a Senate panel hearing last week, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have been delivered to the country as early as February 12 if the Philippines had its own indemnification law.

""The reopening of businesses should be staggered and based on which LGUs have already implemented their respective COVID-19 vaccine plans,"" Biazon said in a statement.
""This way, we can ensure that the patrons going to these businesses will not be at risk for infection to the coronavirus and become unknowing vectors.""
Biazon issued the statement amid the government's plan to reopen leisure establishments such as cinemas, museums, and video and interactive game arcades -- a plan opposed by several sectors, including local officials.
The lawmaker pointed out that the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IAFT) should synchronize the opening of sectors in the economy with that of the COVID-19 vaccine plan for that specific sector.

""We should identify sectors in the economy to open up, and the reopening should be tied in with a vaccination plan for that sector. This will help boost not just immunity, but more importantly, the confidence of consumers to actually patronize those businesses,” Biazon said.
He said if businesses were opened without a ""confidence-building measure"" such as a concrete vaccination plan, ""the consumer response may not be enough to sustain the overhead cost.""
Biazon added that this could also lead to a surge of COVID-19 infections.
Some mayors in Metro Manila have expressed apprehension on the reopening of leisure establishments, saying it is still risky for the public as the threat of COVID-19 is still there.

Senator Sonny Angara, Finance committee chair, sponsored Tuesday the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act and sought its swift approval.
He said the bill seeks to authorize the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.
It also allows local government units to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through multiparty agreements.
The LGUs will be allowed to make advance payments but they can only purchase vaccines and supplies for up to 50% of their target population. The 50% cap may be adjusted by the IATF depending on the supply.

Angara said, as proposed by Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, LGUs must give due priority to frontline healthworkers, senior citizens, and indigent persons. They will also be required to exercise transparency and report any supply or purchase agreement they will enter.
He added, as recommended by Senator Joel Villanueva, the bill states the LGUs have to submit a masterlist of the names and profiles of their constituents who are eligible to receive vaccines.
“While there is roughly P82.5 billion that has been appropriated in 2021 for our national immunization program against COVID-19, we are adding more to this fund by allowing LGUs to use whatever resources they have to purchase vaccines and related supplies,” the senator said.
“By allowing LGUs to take an active part in the procurement of vaccines, we also increase the volumes that we are purchasing, which in turn would allow the national government, particularly the office of our vaccine czar Sec. Charlie Galvez, to negotiate for more affordable prices,” he added.
Under the bill, private entities, in cooperation with the DOH and NTF, will also be allowed to purchase vaccines for their own use through a multiparty agreement.
The bill also states that purchases of COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies for their storage, transport, and distribution will be exempted from customs duties, value-added tax (VAT), excise tax, donor’s tax, and other fees and charges.
“This is to complement the exemptions provided in the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act or CREATE which is awaiting the signature of the President,” said Angara.
The Finance committee chair said the measure also seeks to establish a COVID-19 National Indemnity Fund, as proposed by the Department of Finance, which shall only be used to compensate any inoculated person who will experience severe adverse effect or worse death.
“This fund will be worth P500 million. And as suggested by Minority Floor Leader Drilon, it will be sourced from the Contingent Fund and shall be administered by PhilHealth,” he said.
The bill also contains provision for the creation of Vaccine Passport Program. Vaccination passports will be issued by the Department of Health to individuals who have been inoculated and will contain basic information about the person, as well as the brand of vaccine used and the date of inoculation.
Angara said since the passports are intended to be digital, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) will be mandated to develop the needed digital systems and applications. But because of the digital divide in the country, the passports will also be available as printed documents.
“These passports will serve as documentary proof that a person has completed a full round of COVID-19 vaccinations, which could then allow them to go abroad to wherever they are permitted, engage in non-essential domestic travel, to grant them quick passage through local checkpoints, and even access to business establishments,” the senator said.
He said a special task group composed of medical and vaccine experts will be established to conduct post-vaccination monitoring of patients.
“This is to ensure a quick response in case there are any who might experience serious adverse side effects after being vaccinated,” he said.
The bill also authorizes the Health Technology Assessment Council or HTAC to make recommendations to the DOH and PhilHealth about COVID-19 vaccines based on preliminary Phase III clinical trials, but only when the relevant vaccine manufacturer has been issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“The development of COVID-19 vaccines in such a short amount of time is in itself a huge scientific achievement. But that alone will not end this pandemic.  That alone will not bring things back to normal,” said Angara.
“To achieve that, we will need nothing less than the whole nation acting together. All sectors of society, all levels of government, all our policies, all our regulations, all our systems need to be aligned and properly synced. Every part will need to act harmoniously.  In the end, we won’t just be injecting vaccines. We’ll be injecting hope—which is perhaps the single-most important ingredient to our recovery as a nation,” he added.—AOL, GMA News",GMA News

According to Sandra Aguinaldo’s report on “24 Oras,” Goffin said the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, which was supposed to arrive last week, has no connection with the EU’s new export control regulation.
“For the Philippines and many other countries, this export license will not apply for the COVAX Initiative which is very relevant to the Philippines because the first Pfizer vaccine will arrive very soon under the COVAX Initiative,” Goffin said.
The Belgian government earlier disclosed a new procedure that pharmaceutical firms will have to take when requesting a license to export COVID-19 vaccines outside of the EU.
According to the Belgian government, securing an export license will enhance transparency in vaccine delivery and will be required until March 31, 2021.

Goffin said the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines will not be affected by the new regulation as this was from the COVAX Initiative.
The COVAX initiative is a global collaboration of manufacturers and experts that seeks to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
COVAX is co-led by GAVI vaccines alliance, the World Health Organization, and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It aims to deliver two billion doses of effective, approved COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.
However, Goffin said COVID-19 vaccines that will be bought from Pfizer outside the COVAX Initiative will undergo the export control regulation.
“It’s the nature of Belgium and the European Union to have as many countries having access to vaccines because this is a worldwide crisis and we have to address it globally. I can assure you that the European Union, Belgium, are really ready to help countries, including the Philippines, to get out of this mess,” he said.

The WHO official said the Philippines had requested 900,000 doses of Pfizer's vaccine and low dead space syringes.
Low dead space syringes ensure less wastage per vial. It can make five-dose vials yield one more or six doses.
No law, no delivery
The country's lack of an indemnification law—a measure ensuring compensation for individuals who develop serious side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine—has delayed the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Philippines.
At a Senate panel hearing last week, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have been delivered to the country as early as February 12 if the Philippines had its own indemnification law.
The Philippines is expected to receive at least 5.6 million doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines within the first quarter of 2021, with the initial batch of 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines arriving this month.
Galvez has been calling on Congress to pass an indemnification law, which he said is required by COVAX, the globally-pooled vaccine procurement and distribution effort co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
Indemnification deal
With the law still being crafted in Congress, the Philippine government proposed an  agreement with Pfizer-BioNTech that would ensure compensation for Filipinos who will experience serious side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
“As reported by Sec. Galvez, our vaccine czar, the indemnification agreement with Pfizer is being reviewed by our team and should be finalized in a few days,” National Task Force Against COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon said in a message to reporters.
“This will allow us to complete the documents needed for the delivery of the 117,000 Pfizer doses from the COVAX facility,” he added.
Bills have been filed in Congress for the creation of an indemnity mechanism but presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said President Rodrigo Duterte would not immediately certify them as urgent.
No certification as urgent
He said that certifying proposed measures as urgent did not guarantee quick passage into law by Congress.
“Ang mas importante ay ang mensahe ng Presidente sa Kongreso na ito po ay urgent at priority ng administration dahil kung wala ito ay baka maantala ang pagdating ng bakuna galing sa Covax facility,” Roque said on Friday.

Meanwhile, Drilon said Congress was open to passing a measure that would indemnify COVID-19 vaccines from possible side effects given the immediate need for such medicines.

PANTI,2021-02-11 13:14:00,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the compassionate use of the COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinopharm for the benefit of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) members, Malacañang said Thursday.
At a press briefing, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the compassionate use will cover 10,000 doses.
“It (getting Sinopharm) was a decision of PSG,” Roque said.
Roque, however, did not provide further details on how the PSG will procure the vaccines, saying he does not have that information.
Pressed why Sinopharm was the PSG’s choice, Roque pointed to the delayed delivery of COVID-19 vaccines Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca which were scheduled to arrive in the country mid February via the COVAX facility—a global effort which raised resources to fund COVID-19 response initiatives, including COVID-19 vaccines.

“I think the answer is obvious ‘no, wala tayong nakukuhang supply pa sa ngayon ng Pfizer at saka ng AstraZeneca, naantala nga po iyong pagdating na inaasahan natin na mid-February at ngayon inaasahan natin either third or fourth week,” Roque said.
A vaccine needs to secure an emergency use authorization from the FDA for it to be legally administered in the Philippines. Sinopharm has yet to apply for an EUA before the FDA.
The FDA, however, can allow the use of the vaccine without EUA approval provided that the vaccine secured a compassionate use permit.
Some members of PSG, however, have already received COVID-19 shots that were donated to them as early as September or October last year, according to PSG commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III in December.
Durante made the admission after President Rodrigo Duterte claimed during a televised address that some members of the military received shots of COVID-19 vaccine supposedly manufactured by  Sinopharm.
Last January 27, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the probe on PSG members getting inoculated with unregistered COVID-19 vaccine has hit a blank wall after their queries went unanswered by the PSG.
Illegal vaccination probe
In a separate statement sent to GMA News Online on Thursday, Domingo clarified that the issuance of compassionate use for Sinopharm does not absolve the PSG of possible liability over their admission that they vaccinated themselves with an unregistered Sinopharm vaccine in September and October last year.
“[The compassionate use permit is] for future use. The investigation is still being pursued,” Domingo said.
Likewise, Domingo underscored that the FDA’s issuance of permit for compassionate use is not tantamount to FDA’s stamp of approval.
“The PSG applied and complied with all requirements for the CSP. It was granted yesterday and the PSG Hospital takes full responsibility for the vaccines and will report utilization and outcomes to FDA,” Domingo pointed out.
“The CSP (compassionate special permit) is for future use and the permit is for one time importation,” Domingo added.
The PSG, Domingo said, applied for the CSP permit for Sinopharm last January 18.
Ultimately, Roque said that the PSG deserves to get the COVID-19 vaccine immediately because such is necessary to protect the President.
“Kaya nga po compassionate use dahil kinakailangan mabakunahan na iyong ibang miyembro pa ng PSG dahil nga po sa kanilang trabaho na nagbibigay seguridad sa ating Presidente,” Roque said. — KBK/RSJ, GMA News

Last week, Johnson & Johnson said it asked US health regulators to authorize its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, and added it will apply to European authorities in the coming weeks.
The drugmaker's application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed its Jan. 29 report in which it said the vaccine had a 66% overall efficacy at preventing moderate-to-severe disease.

“This will convince more people to get vaccinated and therefore increase the number of registrants before the actual rollout,” said Zamora.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. in late January said the Philippine government was informed that it may receive 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine as well as 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca jab in mid to late February.
According to the Department of Health, the COVAX facility will provide COVID-19 vaccines to 20 percent of the country’s population but only those for 15 percent will be free. Vaccines for the remaining five percent will be paid by the government.
Galvez, however, assured the public that the decrease in the allocation of free vaccines from the COVAX facility would not be a problem, saying the government could still secure additional doses at a reasonable price.
Pruce said the United Kingdom had funded 548 million pounds into the COVAX facility that will help distribute COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries throughout 2021.

Dr. Razel Nikka Hao, Deputy of COVID-19 Surveillance and Quick Action Unit, said that the 116,000 health workers is just an initial list and that registration is still ongoing.
“At this point, we are in the process of master listing for group A1 or all of the workers in frontline health care services.

Under the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program, workers in frontline health services are on top of the priority list. The limited COVID-19 vaccine supply, however, will further  trim this list based on the COVID-19 burden of the area, the local government unit’s capacity to store and distribute vaccines, and the exposure and mortality risk of individuals.
Based on government records, the NCR remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country with 4,602 new COVID-19 cases recorded in the last two weeks.

Thousands of variants have been documented as the virus mutates, including the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants which appear to spread more swiftly than others.
British Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it was very unlikely that the current vaccines would not work against the new variants.
""Its very unlikely that the current vaccine won't be effective on the variants whether in Kent or other variants especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalization,"" Zahawi told Sky News.
""All manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others, are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant—there are about 4,000 variants around the world of COVID now.""

While thousands of variants have arisen as the virus mutates on replication, only a very small minority are likely to be important and to change the virus in an appreciable way, according to the British Medical Journal.
The so called British variant, known as VUI-202012/01, has mutations including a change in the spike protein that viruses use to bind to the human ACE2 receptor—meaning that it is probably easier to catch.
""We have the largest genome sequencing industry—we have about 50% of the world's genome sequencing industry—and we are keeping a library of all the variants so that we are ready to respond—whether in the autumn or beyond—to any challenge that the virus may present and produce the next vaccine,"" Zahawi said.
Vaccine race
The novel coronavirus—known as SARS-CoV-2—has killed 2.268 million people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019, according to Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.
Israel is currently far ahead of the rest of the world on vaccinations per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, the United States and then Spain, Italy and Germany.
Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca are combined in a two-shot schedule.
The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of vaccines could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.
The trial will examine the immune responses of an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca's, as well as vice versa, with intervals of four and 12 weeks.
Both the mRNA shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech and the adenovirus viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are currently being rolled out in Britain, with a 12-week gap between two doses of the same vaccine. — Reuters",GMA News

In one study of 59 healthcare workers who recovered from COVID-19 and received one of the vaccines, antibody levels after the first shot were higher than levels usually seen after two doses in people without a history of COVID-19.
In a separate study, researchers found that 41 COVID-19 survivors developed ""high antibody titers within days of vaccination,"" and those levels were 10 to 20 times higher than in uninfected, unvaccinated volunteers after just one vaccine dose.

German biotech company CureVac, which began late-stage testing of the vaccine in December and expects to announce interim results this quarter, said it aims to produce up to 300 million doses in 2021 and between 600 million and 1 billion doses in 2022.
Bayer, making the first foray into vaccine manufacturing in its 160-year history, expects to produce 160 million doses of the CureVac shot in 2022 at its Wuppertal site in western Germany, head of pharma Stefan Oelrich told a news conference.
Though the volume target was for next year, Bayer hopes to be able to launch production in 2021, Oerlich said.

It's the first state in the US to remove nearly every eligibility requirement for the Covid-19 vaccine -- a milestone possible, the state's chief medical officer said, because of the state's success in vaccinating vulnerable Alaskans.
""Soon this virus will be a preventable disease, if people choose to get vaccinated,"" said Dr. Anne Zink of Alaska's Department of Health and Social Services in a Tuesday news conference. ""This is our shot to end the pandemic.""
Starting this week, Alaskans ages 16 and up can make an appointment to receive the Pfizer vaccine. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are available to residents 18 years and older.

Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who tested positive for Covid-19 last month, said in a statement that the milestone ""should come as no surprise"" given the cooperation of state residents and an enviably smooth vaccine rollout.
How Alaska is getting vaccinations right
Alaska has consistently ranked among the top states in percentage of residents vaccinated, according to CNN's Covid-19 vaccine tracker. About 41 vaccine doses have been administered for every 100 residents, and over 16% of the state's population has been fully vaccinated.
The state's robust public health system -- and experience in distributing vaccines to the far reaches of the massive state -- had equipped it for a successful vaccine rollout, Zink told CNN last week. And the state's 229 sovereign tribes received their own vaccine allocations, which relieved some of the pressure off the state to provide for all 730,000-plus residents.
Even before Tuesday's announcement, Alaska's vaccine eligibility had already expanded to include essential workers, residents of multigenerational housing and young people who accompanied seniors to their vaccination appointment, a strategy that Zink and officials from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium said addressed the disproportionate death rates among low-income residents and Alaska Natives.
The state currently has 430,685 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine -- not enough to vaccinate the entire state within a few weeks.
""We know we don't have enough vaccine in the state of Alaska to do everyone tonight,"" Zink said. ""But even if you're thinking about it, let (the state's Covid-19 helpline) know, and they can help connect you to an appointment if appointments become filled quickly as more vaccine comes into the state.""
Appointments for vaccines will likely fill up quickly, Zink said in the news conference, but more will become available as soon as the state gets its monthly vaccine allotment.

Northwell Health, which administered the vaccine, donated the vial from intensive care unit nurse Sandra Lindsay's Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination.
It also donated her vaccination record card, her scrubs, and her hospital identification badge. Lindsay is the first person known to have received the vaccine following its authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration in December.
Along with Lindsay's vaccine vial, the Smithsonian received vials from other Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. It also received syringes, diluents, and vaccination records related to the administration process.

Northwell also gifted the Smithsonian artifacts involved in the shipping process of the vaccines and objects that helped maintain and monitor its temperature.
""Dec. 14 was a historic moment for all: the day the very first COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the United States,"" said Michael Dowling, president and CEO of Northwell Health, according to a Smithsonian news release.
""It was our first real sign of hope after so many dark months in the fight against the global pandemic. ... But when Sandra Lindsay rolled up her sleeve, we weren't just showing our team members the safety and efficacy of this groundbreaking vaccine -- we were telling the world that our country was beginning a new fight back to normalcy. It was an extraordinary moment, and I thank the Smithsonian for preserving this important milestone,"" Dowling said.
The museum formed a task force in April 2020 aimed at chronicling events from the past year as well as documenting the effects the pandemic has had on businesses, work, politics, and culture, the Smithsonian release reads. Earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci donated to the museum his personal 3D model that he would often bring to meetings and press conferences to help explain the coronavirus.
""The urgent need for effective vaccines in the U.S. was met with unprecedented speed and emergency review and approval,"" said Anthea M. Hartig, the museum's Elizabeth MacMillan director, according to the Smithsonian release.
""These now historic artifacts document not only this remarkable scientific progress but represent the hope offered to millions living through the cascading crises brought on by COVID-19.""

Blood serum samples from people who had received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine “efficiently” neutralized a version of the virus engineered to carry the same mutations as the variant, known as the P.1.
For the study, published by the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday, researchers at Pfizer, BioNTech and the University of Texas Medical Branch genetically engineered the virus to create versions carrying mutations found in a range of coronavirus variants, including P.1.
They tested them against blood samples taken from 15 people 2 or 4 weeks after they had received a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as part of a clinical trial.
The team found that the blood samples were able to neutralize the Brazil variant “roughly” as well as it could neutralize an earlier strain of the virus from January 2020.
ADVERTISEMENT
The P.1 variant is suspected of fueling a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Brazil. It was found in 42% of samples in one survey carried out in Manaus and cases have since emerged in countries including the US, the UK and Japan.
The P.1 variant has mutations in common with the variant first identified in South Africa that are thought to make it more contagious and possibly able to evade immunity from vaccines -- though this new study suggests the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may still be effective.
Pfizer previously reported findings that blood samples also neutralized variant B.1.351, first reported in South Africa. The study found neutralization was still “robust but lower.""
In February, Pfizer said that there is no evidence in real life that the South African variant escapes the protection offered by its vaccine but that they were working on developing a booster shot and an updated vaccine.
""Nevertheless, Pfizer and BioNTech are taking the necessary steps, making the right investments, and engaging in the appropriate conversations with regulators to be in a position to develop and seek authorization for an updated mRNA vaccine or booster once a strain that significantly reduces the protection from the vaccine is identified,"" Pfizer said in a statement at the time.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/3/4/us-white-house-covid-vaccines.html,'They just were not all in': How the US White House convinced two pharmaceutical giants to collaborate on a vaccine,Jeremy Diamond,2021-03-04 11:30:47,"(CNN) — US President Joe Biden's coronavirus response team learned two things his first week in office: Johnson & Johnson's one-shot coronavirus vaccine was highly effective -- but the company was millions of doses behind its production schedule.
Preliminary conversations that began under the Trump administration about a vaccine manufacturing partnership between the pharmaceutical giant and its competitor, Merck, whose own vaccine attempt had failed, were ""incremental"" and going nowhere fast, according to two senior administration officials. And Johnson & Johnson seemed reluctant to commit to a large-scale deal with Merck, the officials said.
""They just were not all in,"" one of the officials told CNN.
That changed when Jeff Zients, the White House's coronavirus czar, called Johnson & Johnson's CEO Alex Gorsky on a Sunday in early February and urged the company to meet the moment, stressing that the US is in a ""national emergency"" and that it was time to go ""big and bold.""
""You can't be incremental and small in your thinking. We have to overwhelm this problem,"" one senior administration official said, recounting the conversation, which lasted an hour more than the scheduled 15 minutes.
Zients reminded Gorsky -- a West Point graduate and US military veteran -- of Johnson & Johnson's major contributions during World War II, including manufacturing the first-ever duct tape and other military supplies. Just as Americans remembered Johnson & Johnson's contributions then, its efforts to accelerate the vaccination of Americans would be their new legacy, Zients said, according to two senior officials.
""That was really a turning point,"" one of the officials said, noting that Gorsky ""embraced"" the approach and discussions about a large-scale partnership with Merck quickly turned more serious.

Hanging over that conversation and others between Biden administration officials and executives from both companies was Biden's authority under the Defense Production Act to compel the companies to partner if they were unwilling. A senior administration official said that authority was never explicitly threatened in conversations with both companies, but added that it was implicitly a motivating factor.
""The DPA is always there, implicitly as a tool, which brings people to the table and puts people on their toes,"" the official said.
The administration would have been willing to invoke the DPA's coercive authorities had the two companies not reached an agreement, but did not need to, the official said. Instead, Biden is exercising other authorities under the DPA to invest $105 million to help Merck retrofit its manufacturing facilities to produce the vaccine at scale and to expedite the supply of key vaccine production materials to Johnson & Johnson.
Biden announced the partnership on Tuesday, which he said will speed the production of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and ensure the US has ""enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,"" two months earlier than previously anticipated. He compared the partnership to ""the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War II.""
A Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined to comment for this story, referring CNN to comments Gorsky, the company's CEO, made Wednesday at a Washington Post event.
Gorsky said the company felt compelled to ""be doing everything we can to accelerate"" vaccine production and ""make a real difference with this virus.""
""In discussions with the government and trying to say, 'Hey what else could we be doing? How else could we accelerate?"" Gorsky said. ""And that's when in conversations that we were able to sit down together and bring this partnership to fruition.""
A Merck spokesman did not respond to CNN's requests for comment, but the company's executive vice president for manufacturing Sanat Chattopadhyay said in a statement Tuesday that the company looks ""forward to combining our expertise with Johnson & Johnson to help increase supply and expand access to"" the coronavirus vaccine.
Discussions about a manufacturing partnership between Johnson & Johnson and Merck began during the Trump administration, which had secured the initial purchase of 100 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. While Trump administration officials did not secure the partnership, those Trump-era discussions helped open the door to a deal between the two pharmaceutical competitors.
""It simply wasn't coming fast enough,"" Biden said Tuesday of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. ""So my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.""
A senior Biden administration official insisted that the conversations between the two companies with Trump administration officials were ""small ball,"" looking to make incremental increases in Johnson & Johnson's production rather than maximizing production capabilities and ensuring Johnson & Johnson facilities would be producing vaccines on a 24/7 schedule -- which will now be the case.
""There's a difference between conversations and it moving forward and the use of the Defense Production Act, which is something this president, and not the prior president, committed to invoking,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday, referring to the assistance to both companies to speed vaccine production.
Moncef Slaoui, the Trump administration's coronavirus vaccine czar, did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.
While administration officials described Zients' early February conversation with Gorsky as a ""turning point,"" it followed several other conversations between Zients and David Kessler, Biden's chief science officer charged with accelerating vaccine production and distribution, and executives at Johnson & Johnson and Merck.
While Biden did not call either company's CEOs directly, a senior official said the President was updated on the negotiations on a regular basis.
Those conversations were also facilitated by Zients' preexisting relationships with the CEOs of both companies, whom he knew from his time in the Obama administration working on health care and economic issues.
The two senior officials also credited Johnson & Johnson and Merck for ultimately getting on board with a partnership following key conversations in early February, with one official saying they ""have really been good corporate citizens in forming this partnership.""
""I think it's important that we acknowledge that both Merck and J&J are doing the right thing,"" the official said.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/3/3/mammograms-swelling-covid-vaccine.html,"Mammograms pick up swelling due to COVID-19 vaccine, causing unnecessary fear, radiologists say",Sandee LaMotte,2021-03-03 02:35:38,"(CNN) -- When she found a lump in her left breast during a routine self-check, Boston primary care physician Dr. Devon Quasha knew exactly what to do. She immediately scheduled a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound at Massachusetts General Hospital for early January.
Then the Moderna vaccine became available to health care professionals in the city. She received her first COVID-19 shot about a week before her scheduled mammogram.
Quasha didn't notice much of a reaction to the vaccine at first, but a couple of days before her appointment her left arm began to hurt.
Tender, swollen lumps developed under her left armpit, along with a large swelling above her collarbone -- all areas where the body has lymph nodes, the body's filters for germs.
ADVERTISEMENT
""You have lymph nodes above and below your collarbone,"" Quasha said. ""You don't want to feel those. It was scary when I felt it.""
Lymph nodes contain immune cells that help fight invaders. That's why it made sense to Quasha that the nodes were reacting to the vaccine, building antibodies as they were designed to do. But she couldn't be sure.
The swelling was only on the left side where she had gotten the shot -- the same side as the worrisome lump. Was it a reaction to the vaccine or another sign of breast cancer?
'It was like a wildfire'
After the ultrasound, Quasha's radiologist was concerned. She told Quasha she considered the lump she had felt in her breast to be of little significance, but the lymph nodes that showed up as white blobs on her mammogram were another matter.
In non-pandemic times, that finding would set off alarm bells, requiring the need for further investigation, even an immediate biopsy. Yet Quasha had just had the vaccine. After talking it over with her, Quasha said her doctor decided not to do a biopsy at that time. Instead she told Quasha to come back for a follow-up ultrasound in six weeks.
Similar scenarios had been happening in mammogram centers around the country. As radiologists compared notes with colleagues, word began to spread.
""We all started talking about it, and it was like a wildfire,"" said Dr. Connie Lehman, chief of breast imaging in Massachusetts General's department of radiology.
""I cannot tell you how many women are showing nodes on mammograms and people thought it was going to be not that common,"" said Lehman, who is also a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School.
Tales of unnecessary biopsies spurred the patient care committee of the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) to put out an advisory in January: Ask your patients about their COVID-19 status, and record the date and which arm received the vaccine. Consider that before automatically scheduling a biopsy.
""We wanted to advocate that women don't always need to have a biopsy,"" said Dr. Lars Grimm, associate professor of radiology at Duke University School of Medicine and one of the authors of the SBI advisory. ""Because oftentimes the default if you see swollen lymph nodes in a patient would actually be to recommend doing a biopsy.""
Mass General's Lehman agreed. ""When you hear hoofbeats, don't think zebra,"" she said. ""If a woman had a vaccine in the arm on the same side, and the lymph nodes are swollen, this is a normal biological response. It's totally expected. It just doesn't make sense to start imaging.""
That does not mean that women who wish to be sure about their cancer status cannot have a biopsy, Grimm stressed.
""You actually have some women who want to biopsy,"" he said. ""You might tell them, 'Hey, I think this is due to your Covid vaccine, and I'm sure that it's going to resolve in a few weeks on its own and you're going to be fine.' But that patient tells you, 'I'm not going to be comfortable waiting, I want to know now.' ""
Focus on screening to save lives
For Quasha, the knowledge that many women were experiencing the same type of reaction to the vaccine was a welcome relief from worry. After a discussion with her doctor, she said she no longer needs the follow-up screening.
""I was very reassured,"" Quasha said. ""The point here is that there are a number of side effects from the vaccine which are not dangerous but can sometimes increase patient anxiety.""
Instead of bringing women back in for an unnecessary ultrasound, radiology centers should be focused on scheduling women who have missed or are overdue on their mammogram, Lehman said.
""We need to take care of the large percentage of women who didn't get screened because of the shutdowns during Covid,"" she said. ""At Mass General alone, we failed to screen 15,000 women because of Covid, and we're still trying to get them back in.
""This isn't where I need to start doing axillary ultrasounds, because someone had a vaccine and the node swelled. It's just not being practical or pragmatic or putting our patient's needs first,"" she said.
It's not just breast cancer, Lehman stressed. Lymph nodes in other parts of the body are also reacting to the COVID-19 vaccines, causing people with other forms of cancer to undergo unnecessary procedures.
""There have been some false scares and some unnecessary biopsies because people didn't think to ask, and they assume that the node was the cancer coming back,"" she said.
What to do?
To avoid unnecessary worry, SBI recommends women schedule any routine, annual breast screening before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. If a woman has already had the vaccine, or is soon scheduled to do so, the society suggests waiting at least four to six weeks after the second dose before scheduling your appointment.
At Mass General, Lehman and her team have gone a step further. They are screening all women regardless of vaccine status, but telling those with no history of cancer that any swelling in the lymph nodes that might be connected to a COVID-19 vaccine is benign -- meaning not cancerous.
""This follows the American College of Radiology recommendations that if you have a known inflammatory cause you can say it's benign,"" said Lehman, who recently published a paper on the hospital's procedures.
""If their concern is a swelling or tenderness after the vaccine in their armpit, we suggest that they wait four to six weeks, talk to their doctor, and if it persists, then we have them come in to do an evaluation of it,"" she said.
Whatever you do, experts stress, don't skip getting your breast cancer screening when it is recommended. A study published Tuesday in the journal Radiology that followed over half a million women made the point clearly: Women who skip even one scheduled mammography screening before they are diagnosed with breast cancer have a significantly higher risk of dying.
In fact, the risk of having a fatal breast cancer within 10 years of diagnosis was 50% lower for women who had regular breast screenings, the study said.

In a virtual briefing on Monday, Gordon said that while the PRC and the government have yet to discuss the possible collaboration, the former is willing to help in the vaccination effort.
""Handa kaming tumulong sa vaccination ng COVID,"" the PRC chief said.
[Translation: We are ready to help in the vaccination against COVID.]
""Wala pa kaming pinag-uusapan (We have not discussed anything yet). I said we're ready to participate, pero wala pang specifics (but there are no specifics yet),"" he said.

“Kaming mga 70 [years old], we have to be careful. Ako naman, may doctor akong sarili. She thinks that another brand, I would not mention it... 'Yun nalang ang hinihintay nya and hinihintay ko,” the President, who is turning 76 next month, said in a press briefing.
[Translation: For 70-year-olds like us, we have to be careful. I have a doctor who thinks I should be injected with another brand, but I won’t mention the name. That’s what she and I are waiting for.]
The briefing came after the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac, which were donated by the Chinese government. Earlier, the Food and Drug Administration said Sinovac is not the most ideal for senior citizens, as well as healthcare workers constantly exposed to the virus, due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4%. But Health spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire later said that while clinical trials show lower efficacy in preventing mild symptoms, CoronaVac is still 100% effective against moderate and severe symptoms.
""In the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage... No doubt about it,"" Duterte added. ""As to what brand, ‘yan ang problema [that's the problem], because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor.""
The President said his doctor is eyeing another ""Chinese brand."" While it is not clear if this is Sinopharm, he earlier expressed preference for the particular pharmaceutical firm. Sinopharm vaccine has also been administered to his security detail and allegedly to other high-ranking government officials despite the absence of regulatory approval in the country.

Sinovac 'guaranteed safe and effective’
Despite not planning to receive it himself, Duterte has guaranteed the safety and effectiveness of Sinovac vaccines. His reassurance comes in the heels of hesitancy, especially among healthcare workers who are first in line in the national immunization program.
“To my fellow Filipinos, please set your fears aside. These vaccines are backed by science and deliberated by Filipino experts,” he said in a speech during the turnover ceremony. However, he also later on said he will not force those who are not comfortable to be inoculated with them.
The President defended last month the government’s preference for vaccines produced in China, saying that they are as good as those made by American and European pharmaceutical companies.
Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque advised the public to take whatever COVID-19 vaccine is available as soon as possible.
“Uulitin ko lang po ang mga sinabi ng mga experts. Ang pinakamagaling na bakuna ay ang nariyan na at maaari nang gamitin,” said Roque.
[Translation: I will just reiterate what the experts have said. The best vaccine you can get is the one that is already available and ready for use.]
Besides the donation, Roque said the country has purchased 25 million more doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/2/27/pfizer-covid-vaccine-single-dose-protect-asymptomatic-infection.html,"Single dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine may protect against asymptomatic infection, preprint study says",Jamie Gumbrecht,2021-02-27 00:30:11,"(CNN) - More new research suggests a single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine can protect against asymptomatic coronavirus infection, which could help reduce transmission of the virus.
Researchers used PCR tests to screen for coronavirus in vaccinated and non-vaccinated Cambridge University Hospitals health care workers who reported to work feeling well.
Unvaccinated health care workers were positive for coronavirus in 0.80% of tests; vaccinated health care workers less than 12 days from a single dose were positive in 0.37% of tests; and vaccinated health care workers who were at least 12 days out from one dose were positive in 0.20% of tests.
The study, led by Cambridge researchers, has not yet been published or peer-reviewed, but the authors call it “real-world evidence for a high level of protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection” from a single dose of the vaccine. They noted that the more transmissible B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the United Kingdom, dominated at the time of their research, and prior infection was relatively low among the population tested.
A large study released this week by Public Health England (PHE) found that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine “provides high levels of protection against infection and symptomatic disease,” reducing the risk of infection by 72% after three weeks, while two vaccine doses reduced the risk of infection by 85%. PHE's Siren Study involved health care workers younger than 65.
“These studies are very encouraging because they suggest that the vaccines will prevent the spread of the virus,” Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Warwick Medical School, said in a response to the Science Media Centre in the UK. “You can’t spread the virus if you’re not infected and these studies show that the vaccine blocks infection in individuals who don’t have symptoms but could pass on the infection.”

The shipment, consisting of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccines, arrived at 7 am GMT Wednesday on an Emirates flight at Kotoka International Airport, in Ghana's capital Accra.
The minister for health-designate, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, led a government delegation to receive the consignment.
As the plane carrying the vaccines landed, state-run Ghana Broadcasting Corporation journalist Abdul Hayi-Moomen declared: ""The flight carrying the vaccines that we so much look forward to receiving, I believe hope has arrived.""

The vaccines were produced by the Serum Institute of India, in the Indian city of Pune, and are part of the first wave of COVID-19 vaccines headed to low and middle-income countries, the joint statement added.
""Today marks the historic moment for which we have been planning and working so hard,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. ""With the first shipment of doses, we can make good on the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the race for life-saving vaccines.""
COVAX is an international coalition set up to give equal access to the vaccine to all countries. Wealthier nations have, in the past, been accused of ""hoarding"" vaccines and leaving African countries behind in the race to inoculate their populations.
In comparison to other regions, African countries have been slow to start vaccinating against Covid, with only a handful of countries who have started a vaccines campaign.
""We will not end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus after Ghana received its vaccines.
""Today is a major first step towards realizing our shared vision of vaccine equity, but it's just the beginning,"" he added.
""We still have a lot of work to do with governments and manufacturers to ensure that vaccination of health workers and older people is underway in all countries within the first 100 days of this year,"" he said in a statement issued by GAVI, the global health alliance working to increase immunization in developing nations.
The UK's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, described Wednesday's rollout as a ""huge step forward in ending this pandemic.""
""As one of the biggest donors to COVAX the UK is ensuring that more than one billion vaccine doses will be sent to 92 countries so that no one is left behind in this global fight. We will only save lives and reduce the risk of future infections if we prevent the virus spreading in the world's developing countries,"" he added.
Ghana's information ministry says the vaccines will be first administered to health workers, people over 60, and those with underlying health conditions. They also plan to secure additional vaccines through external agencies, a statement from the ministry said.
Last month, India and the African Union announced plans for the Serum Institute to supply 400 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Africa.
Ghana has reported at least 80,759 cases of COVID-19 and 582 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/2/24/russia-shows-off-new-covid-vaccine-factory.html,EXCLUSIVE: Russia shows off new COVID-19 vaccine factory even as its people hesitate to get the shot,Zahra Ullah and Matthew Chance,2021-02-24 05:45:21,"(CNN) -- Decades ago, Soviet scientists researched biological weapons at a site in Volginsky, about 70 miles east of Moscow. Now, that site is being used to mass-produce a vaccine aimed at protecting people around the world from the coronavirus.
CNN gained exclusive access to the facility, now home to Generium Pharmaceutical, which has been contracted to scale up production of the Russian vaccine against COVID-19, Sputnik V.
The vast high-tech complex is one of seven new production centers across the country.
Every step in the production process had to be carefully designed and calibrated, including vast water filtration systems, to mass-produce the brand-new vaccine.
""In principle, the process of manufacturing was known on a small, lab-scale, but making it on a large industrial scale is another universe,"" Dmitry Poteryaev, chief science officer at Generium told CNN.
""You cannot simply go from one liter of bioreactor to 100 liters or 1000 or 1 ton of bioreactor. Every process is different, the oxygenation is different, the mass balance is different,"" he explained.
He said those problems had been overcome several months ago and the factory was now ready to step up production further.
""Now, we are producing several million doses every month and hoping to get an even higher amount, maybe like 10 or 20 million per month,"" Poteryaev said.
In cavernous walk-in refrigerators, with temperatures even colder than the freezing Russian winter, vials of Sputnik V sit packed in crates, awaiting distribution. Every vial has its own unique QR code, we are told, so it can be traced to individual patients no matter where in the world they are.
The vaccine has become one of the world's most preordered, with at least 30 countries, from Argentina to the Philippines, signing contracts for nearly 2.5 billion doses so far, according to figures from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is responsible for global production and distribution of the vaccine.
Hesitancy at home
But demand among Russians for Sputnik V has so far proven much less enthusiastic.
This is a country with one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 infections in the world -- more than 4.1 million cases and counting. But it also has one of the world's highest rates of vaccine hesitancy. One recent opinion poll, published by the independent Levada Center, indicated just 38% of Russians are willing to be vaccinated.
Earlier this month, one of the key scientists behind the development of the vaccine said about 2.2 million people -- less than 2% of the Russian population -- have received at least the initial dose of the two-shot regimen.
Sputnik V was the first vaccine against COVID-19 to be approved for use anywhere in the world last August, even before large-scale human trials had been completed.
There was broad early skepticism about Sputnik V, which took its name from the world's first satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, starting the space race with the United States. Critics say ""Putin's vaccine"" was designed to be another first in a global race, to project Kremlin power, regardless of how effective or safe it was.
But the results of large-scale human trials, published and peer-reviewed in the prestigious Lancet medical journal earlier this month showed an impressive 91.6% efficacy for the vaccine.
Still, anti-vaccine conspiracy theories are running amok on the internet and viewed by millions in Russia, according to monitoring groups. Alexander Arkhipova, a social anthropologist at a state university known as RANEPA, told CNN that many Russians have a cultural tendency to distrust the medical establishment, which is seen as a controlling arm of the government, meddling in peoples' private lives.
Another reason for doubt may be that while President Vladimir Putin said his daughter was vaccinated, he has yet to take the shot.
The Kremlin has brushed off questions as to why, saying Putin has a vaccine scheduled, and that when he eventually gets inoculated, the nation will be informed.
But in a country where many people look to the Kremlin strongman for his lead, his abstinence on the Sputnik V front is notable and discouraging.
Ice cream incentives
All adults with no underlying health conditions in Russia are now eligible for a free vaccination. But progress in Moscow, for instance, is painfully slow. In a city of more than 12 million people, fewer than 600,000 have been vaccinated so far, according to Mayor Sergey Sobyanin.
So, the push is on to increase the numbers.
The state funded Gamaleya Institute, where the vaccine was developed, was happy to invite the CNN team to get the inoculation, as it were, from the source.
And across Moscow -- the epicenter of Russia's coronavirus pandemic -- pop-up clinics are being set up.
There's one in the upscale shopping mall GUM, a short walk from snowy Red Square, where Muscovites can peruse the latest fashions at pricey boutiques, before popping upstairs to get Sputnik V. They even get free ice cream with every inoculation -- chocolate-coated vanilla.
Staff told CNN they were vaccinating about 200 people every day. There is capacity for hundreds more.
Another clinic has been set up in a trendy food hall, Depo Moscow, to encourage vaccination after a street food lunch or sushi dinner.
For lovers of classical music, there's even one inside Helikon, a prestigious Moscow opera house, where austere tones of recorded tenors bellow through the speakers as people wait for their inoculation.
Some people are getting the message that the vaccine is their best chance of surviving the pandemic.
Vadim Svistunov, 84, and his 86-year-old wife Nonna, went to the opera house for both the initial vaccine shot and the booster three weeks later.
""We don't want to go up there yet,"" Svistunov told CNN, as he gestures to the heavens. ""We're not in a hurry,"" he said.

Phase 1/2 trials showed the vaccine candidate elicited an immune response in younger adults that's comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19, but the vaccine did not produce the desired immune response in older adults. The Phase 2 trial will include equal numbers of adults ages 18 to 59 years, and 60 years and above.
“Over the past few weeks, our teams have worked to refine the antigen formulation of our recombinant-protein vaccine, based on learnings from our initial Phase 1/2 study,” Thomas Triomphe, executive vice president and head of Sanofi Pasteur, said in a statement. “We are confident that our vaccine candidate has strong potential and we are very encouraged by the latest preclinical data.""
The companies said the vaccine could be available in the fourth quarter if trial results are positive and the vaccine is authorized. In statements, the companies also said Sanofi has begun work against new coronavirus variants “which will be used to inform next stages of the Sanofi/GSK development program.""

PHE's Siren Study, which was carried out on healthcare workers aged under the age of 65, found that one dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 72% after three weeks, while two vaccine doses reduced the risk of infection by 85%. This high level of protection extended to the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant first identified in the UK in December.
Health workers were tested for COVID-19 infection every two weeks using PCR tests and twice a week with lateral flow tests, Dr. Susan Hopkins, strategic response director at PHE, explained, meaning ""there was a lot of asymptomatic testing,"" she said.
""Overall we are seeing a really strong effect to reducing any infection: asymptomatic and symptomatic,"" Hopkins said during a press conference held by the UK's Science Media Centre on Monday.
PHE also analyzed routine testing data based on symptomatic disease in over 12,000 people, which showed that one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 57% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 disease in those aged over 80 four weeks after the first dose. This increased to 88% one week after the second dose.
Early data has also shown that vaccinated people who are subsequently infected are far less likely to die of, or be hospitalized with, the virus. People over the age of 80 who were infected post vaccination were 41% less likely to be hospitalized with the virus and 57% less likely to die of it.
PHE predicted that protection against severe disease was likely to be over 75% in those who have received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
""The good sign is overall we are beginning to see a decline in hospitalizations and deaths in those vaccinated age groups [and] at least some is attributable to the vaccination program,"" Dr. Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at PHE, said during the press conference.
She said that while the UK's current lockdown had played a part in the decline in hospitalizations, ""the faster speed in decline can be attributed in some aspects to the vaccination program.""
In the PHE release, Ramsay cautioned that despite the encouraging signs ""we don't yet know how much these vaccines will reduce the risk of you passing COVID-19 on to others,"" adding that vaccinated people should continue to follow stay-at-home orders.
The UK has placed its focus on vaccinating as many high-risk people as possible with the first dose.
UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was ""extremely encouraging"" that data supported the UK government's ""decision to maximize the number of people vaccinated with a single dose.""

“We, the leaders of the Group of Seven, met today and resolved to work together to beat COVID-19 and build back better. Drawing on our strengths and values as democratic, open economies and societies, we will work together and with others to make 2021 a turning point for multilateralism and to shape a recovery that promotes the health and prosperity of our people and planet,"" the statement said.
COVAX is a vaccine alliance trying to distribute vaccines to overcome inequality in access to vaccines and distribute shots to low- and middle-income countries. ACT-A is an accelerator that joins forces of various investors and organizations to develop tools to bring the pandemic closer to an end.
At the first G7 event attended by US President Joe Biden, the leaders of some of the world’s strongest economies repeated their support for sustainable development across the globe. They promised to agree concrete action on these priorities at the G7 Summit in the United Kingdom in June.
In addition to these commitments, the G7 leaders also supported the commitment by Japan to “hold the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 in a safe and secure manner this summer as a symbol of global unity in overcoming COVID-19,” they said.

The company said it had delivered the data from its late-stage trial to the WHO.
An emergency use listing would make the vaccine available in more than 190 countries, including multiple developing countries. If authorized, it would also allow J&J to supply the COVAX program – a global distribution and procurement agency that is helping manage COVID-19 vaccines for 190 participating countries.
In December, J&J came to an agreement with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, that is backing the COVAX program. If authorized, J&J expects to provide up to 500 million doses to COVAX through next year, the company said.

“Our filing with the World Health Organization marks another important step in our effort to combat COVID-19 and also in our unwavering commitment to equitable access,” Dr. Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson’s vice chair of the executive committee and chief scientific officer, said in a news release. ""If we are to end the global pandemic, life-saving innovations like vaccines must be within reach for all countries.”
J&J filed for a conditional marketing authorization application in the European Union on Monday.
Next Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration will consider the data the company submitted for an emergency use authorization of the vaccine in the United States. J&J has promised to deliver 100 million doses of its single-dose vaccine to the US by the end of June.
The COVID-19 vaccine’s efficacy against moderate and severe disease ranged from one country to another:
- 72% in the US
- 66% in Latin America
- 57% in South Africa
It was 66% effective globally. This was measured starting one month after the shot. The vaccine is 85% effective overall at preventing hospitalization and 100% at preventing death in all regions where it was tested.

Government officials previously announced that the first batch of vaccines to be supplied by the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility may arrive by the middle of February. However, the delivery got delayed due to the absence of an indemnification deal— which Galvez earlier confirmed was already submitted to the concerned manufacturers, Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
Galvez also pointed out the “difficult” situation with regard to the market supply and demand for the vaccines, saying other countries have also been struggling in getting their doses. He cited the reported “uneven” distribution of the products.

“Hindi necessarily causal ang relationship. Hindi dahil lang sumunod sa pagbabakuna ay galing na sa bakuna ang naramdaman,” Dr. Anna Ong-Lim said in a briefing.
[Translation: The relationship between a vaccine and an adverse event is not necessarily causal. Just because you experienced something after the immunization, it does not mean you got it from the vaccine.]
Possible reason
The expert explained that prior to vaccination, a person may have been exposed to an individual who is ill, and only started exhibiting symptoms after getting the shot.
“Yung iba, kung nagkataon na mayroon na silang exposure sa ibang mga taong nagkasakit, at nagsisimula pa lamang iyong sakit, pwedeng may maramdaman sila after that. Akala nila dahil sa bakuna when in fact na expose pala sila sa taong may nararamdaman at nahawaan sila ng sakit,” she said.
[Translation: For others, it just so happens that they have exposure to infected individuals, and if their illness is in the early stages, they may manifest symptoms after that (vaccination). They think the side effects are due to the vaccine, when in fact they have been infected with a disease beforehand.]
Some diseases have incubation periods. For example, the incubation period of COVID-19 is up to 14 days. This means the symptoms could appear two weeks after a person has been exposed to the coronavirus.

Ong-Lim, citing studies, said adverse reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine usually occur 15 minutes after a person received the shot.
She said they will be on the lookout for vaccine recipients who might experience anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines once the immunization program starts. Some people in other countries have experienced severe allergies after they were inoculated against coronavirus.

Santos said that in their vaccination training, the hospital staff focused on studying the Pfizer brand. The American-made vaccines are expected to be the first to arrive this month, with an initial 117,000 doses for medical frontliners nationwide.
Santos said hospital workers want to make sure no dose goes to waste, as she noted the sensitive requirements in handling COVID-19 vaccines. Among these is the storage temperature requirement, which has to be minus-70 degrees Celsius for Pfizer.
“May mga pagsasanay pa nga po kami na bawal po syang i-shake, kasi pag na-shake mo po sya, kailangan na itapon ‘yun, so sayang naman po [In our training, we were even told that if we accidentally shake the vaccine, it will already have to be discarded, so that would be such a waste],” she added.

It's a question that has been on the minds of researchers and oncologists long before the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine rollouts began. Although there is a consensus that the vaccines are safe for most cancer patients, according to the American Cancer Society and others in the medical community, research into whether they will be effective for cancer patients is still a data-free zone.
The American Cancer Society recommends that cancer patients talk to their doctors before getting any type of vaccine because all patients and their courses of treatment are different.
There are several factors that may require a cancer patient to delay vaccination, including recent stem cell transplants or other recent use of therapy agents known to reduce vaccine efficacy, according to Dr. Laura Makaroff, the American Cancer Society's Senior Vice President for Prevention and Early Detection.
ADVERTISEMENT
""As far as safety of the vaccine, every situation for every patient with cancer is a little different. And there's a spectrum of where any one patient might be in their cancer journey,"" Makaroff told CNN. ""The COVID-19 vaccine is definitely safe for people with cancer but it's important that patients have a conversation with their healthcare provider and their cancer care team to determine when is the right time to have the vaccine.""
""All the guidance that we're seeing -- the American Cancer society and other leading oncology groups -- is that COVID-19 immunization is recommended for patients in active therapy, but we really understand that there are limited safety and efficacy data on these patients,"" Makaroff said.
Even with limited data, many cancer experts, medical groups, and doctors are making a big push for vaccinating most cancer patients -- especially those cancer patients most at risk during the pandemic.
""The potential benefits far outweigh the risks,"" said Dr. Brian Koffman, chief medical officer for the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Society, a group that represents patients with the most common adult form of leukemia in the western world.
""Despite the lack of safety data specifically in patients with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), SARS-Cov-2 vaccination is anticipated to be safe.""
Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who develop symptomatic COVID-19 have an 89% risk of hospitalization, Koffman told CNN, based on a study published in the journal Nature.
CLL is characterized by a weakened immune system. The immunocompromization is so severe that CLL patients are advised to avoid live vaccines such as the ones for measles or yellow fever.
And a weakened immune system also means these cancer patients have an increased risk of death due to Covid-19, according to Dr. Chaitra Ujjani, a physician at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and oncology professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The Nature study, conducted the by European Research Initiative on CLL, found that the mortality rate for CLL patients with symptomatic coronavirus was 31%.
""The thing that people don't quite realize is that the impaired immune system in CLL patients -- due to the disease or some of the treatments for the disease -- can actually impact your response to vaccination,"" Ujjani told CNN.
""We recommend the COVID-19 vaccines for our patients ... but we're not really sure how effective it's going to be,"" she added. ""Patients with blood cancers are typically excluded from the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of the vaccine.""
Cancer-specific vaccine trials underway
To remedy the lack of data, Ujjani is launching a research study involving 500 CLL patients across the country -- all of whom are already slated to receive the vaccine from their doctor or pharmacist -- to determine what kind of immune response they will have to the commercially available vaccines.
The study, which is a collaboration between more than 10 medical institutions, will be the first of its kind and may bring more clarity for cancer patients.
The Seattle Cancer Care Alliance is conducting similar trials for other cancer types, including certain immune system and blood cancers, Ujjani said.
Advocacy groups for other more prevalent types of cancer are also encouraging cancer patients to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The Lung Cancer Action Network recently asked the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to give lung cancer patients expedited access to the vaccines.
""Because COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory condition, this disease presents a unique challenge to lung cancer patients, who are at extremely high risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19,"" said the group in a letter.
More research urgently needed
The scientific community agrees that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients -- and many doctors are working around the clock to get more trials off the ground.
""We need these data so that we can better inform patients and better prioritize the allocation of the vaccines. If these vulnerable patients form an adequate immune response, we should certainly vaccinate them as early as possible,"" Dr. Elad Sharon, senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute, told CNN via email.
""But, if research efforts show that these patients fail to form a protective response to these vaccines, then what we will need to do will be to vaccinate everyone around these patients first, so that our medically vulnerable patients are most protected by the people living with them and caring for them.""
Ujjani added, ""We're all working really hard to answer this question, but it's hard because we've been working kind of against the clock as the vaccines just became available.""
""A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,"" Ujjani told CNN. ""So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine.""

The IFRC described the disparity as alarming and said it could result in “deadly and devasting” consequences, warning that if large areas across the globe remain unvaccinated, the virus will carry on circulating and mutating.
“This is alarming because it is unfair, and because it could prolong or even worsen this terrible pandemic,” Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General of the IFRC, said.
“We are all rowing the same boat. We cannot sacrifice those at highest risk in some countries so that those at lowest risk can be vaccinated in others,” he added.
In an effort to tackle the imbalance in vaccine distribution across the globe, the IFRC announced on Thursday a new 100 million Swiss franc ($110 million) plan that aims to support the immunization of 500 million people against COVID-19.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/2/4/covid-vaccines-development-hit-critical-mass.html,Development of new coronavirus vaccines may be hitting critical mass. Here's how they work,Maggie Fox,2021-02-04 04:42:29,"(CNN) -- Data on vaccines being tested by Johnson & Johnson and Novavax came out last week, and makers of AstraZeneca's vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine published some long-awaited details about their shots on Tuesday.
All indicate high efficacy against the virus, even though they take very different approaches.
Here's how some of the top coronavirus vaccines and vaccine candidates work.
Pfizer/BioNTech
Pfizer and its German-based partner BioNTech use a new approach to making vaccines that uses messenger RNA or mRNA.
ADVERTISEMENT
This design was chosen for a pandemic vaccine years ago because it's one that lends itself to quick turnaround. All that is needed is the genetic sequence of the virus causing the pandemic. Vaccine makers don't even need the virus itself -- just the sequence.
In this case, BioNTech researchers used a little piece of genetic material coding for a piece of the spike protein -- those studs that cover the surface of the coronavirus and the source of its name. Corona means ""crown.""
Messenger RNA is a single strand of the genetic code that cells can ""read"" and use to make a protein. In the case of this vaccine, the mRNA instructs the muscle cells in the arm to make a particular piece of the virus's spike protein called the receptor binding domain. Then the immune system sees it, recognizes it as foreign and is prepared to attack when actual infection occurs.
""RNA is like snapchat messages that expire. RNA vaccines do NOT become a permanent part of your body. They are temporary messages instructing cells to make one viral protein temporarily,"" Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, said on Twitter.
""It takes 25 different coronavirus proteins to make a coronavirus, so there is no worry about the RNA making a virus.""
Clinical trials showed Pfizer's vaccine was 95% effective in preventing symptomatic infections. Pfizer is working to show the vaccine can prevent all infections, including those that don't cause symptoms. It has also been testing its vaccine against some of the worrying new variants of coronavirus. So far, the studies indicate the vaccine can protect against variants causing concern in South Africa and the UK.
MRNA is very fragile so it's encased in lipid nanoparticles -- a coating of a buttery substance that can melt at room temperature. That's why Pfizer's vaccine must be kept at ultracold temperatures of about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 75 degrees Celsius). That means special equipment is needed to transport and store this vaccine.
Pfizer's vaccine won FDA EUA in December and is being delivered to millions of people in the US and UK. The US government has contracted to buy 300 million doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.
Side-effects from vaccination are rare and usually mild. They include fever and headache, although a very few people have experienced allergic reactions to the vaccine. It's not clear what causes the allergic reaction, and the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating.
Moderna
Moderna's vaccine is also based on mRNA. ""mRNA is like software for the cell,"" Moderna said on its website.
And like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, it codes for cells to make a piece of the spike protein.
The Moderna vaccine also goes into the muscle cells of the arm, and perhaps to nearby immune system cells, and instructs them to make pieces of spike protein.
Clinical trials showed Moderna's vaccine was 94% effective in preventing symptomatic infections and the company says it has data showing the vaccine also prevents all infections, including those that do not cause symptoms.
Moderna thinks its vaccine will protect against the coronavirus for at least a year
Moderna has come up with a different formulation for the lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA in its vaccine. These formulations are corporate secrets, but Moderna thinks its approach is better and said its vaccine can be shipped at minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 degrees F) and can be kept stable for 30 days at 2 degrees to 8 degrees C (36 to 46F), the temperature of a standard home refrigerator.
The FDA authorized Moderna's vaccine in December. The US government has contracted to purchase 200 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, and is in talks to purchase another 100 million doses.
Johnson & Johnson's vaccine arm, Janssen Pharmaceuticals
Janssen's coronavirus vaccine is a recombinant vector vaccine. It uses a genetically engineered version of adenovirus 26, which can cause the common cold, but the gene tinkering has disabled it. It also delivers the genetic instructions to make a piece of spike protein.
This is one vaccine that has been tested on the market before. The adenovirus 26 vector was used to make the company's Ebola vaccine, which won marketing authorization from the European Commission in July.
It's the only vaccine tested as a single shot -- a significant advantage in a world complicated by the need to ensure people get two carefully spaced doses of vaccine. Plus, it can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.
Preliminary data released last week showed the vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, but 72% effective in the US trial. Plus, it was 85% effective in preventing severe disease, and almost completely effective in preventing death.
""A vaccine that's inexpensive, that's a single dose, and that has no cold chain requirements -- that's pretty good,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.
Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply for emergency use authorization this week. The company said expects to supply 100 million vaccine doses to the US government in the first half of 2021.
The company is also testing a two-dose regimen in volunteers to see if adding a second dose gives better or longer-lasting protection.
AstraZeneca
AstraZeneca's vaccine, made with a team at Britain's University of Oxford, is, like Janssen's, a vector vaccine. It uses an adenovirus that infects chimpanzees, but doesn't make people sick, to carry the spike protein from the coronavirus into cells.
It was modified so that it doesn't replicate itself, then genetically engineered to inject cells with the DNA encoding for the full coronavirus spike protein.
It's a cheaper way to make vaccines -- but slower than using RNA. The company has pledged to make its vaccine available inexpensively to countries around the world. The vaccine can be kept stable for six months at standard refrigerator temperatures, the company said.
It's approved in Britain but the US FDA is waiting for data from US trials.
Data released from trials in Britain, South Africa and Brazil in a Lancet preprint Tuesday indicated it's about 67% effective at preventing symptomatic infection two weeks after two doses. But the Oxford team also tested some volunteers to see if they became infected at all, and said they think the vaccine prevents infections in general.
Plus, the studies indicated a single dose of vaccine prevented 76% of symptomatic infections for up to 90 days, and if more time passed between the first and second doses, the efficacy improved. When volunteers waited 12 weeks between doses, the vaccine's efficacy went up to 82%. A longer wait between doses would help get more people vaccinated, since the companies are struggling to keep up with demand.
Novavax
Maryland-based biotechnology company Novavax specializes in ""protein subunit"" vaccines. They use virus-like nanoparticles as a base and cover them with genetically engineered pieces of the coronavirus spike protein.
This is also a tried and true vaccine approach. A hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns is a protein subunit vaccine, as is the human papillomavirus or HPV vaccine and FluBlok, Sanofi's influenza vaccine.
Novavax uses an insect virus called a baculovirus to get the coronavirus spike protein into moth cells, which then produce the protein. This is harvested and mixed with an adjuvant -- an immune booster --based on saponin, found in soap bark trees.
A Phase 3 trial conducted in the UK showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 89%, the company said last week. It has not published any data yet, but announced results in a news release. The vaccine was found to have 95.6% efficacy against the original novel coronavirus and 85.6% against the variant first identified in the UK, known as B.1.1.7.
And a Phase 2b study conducted in South Africa indicated the vaccine was 60% effective against a variant circulating there and known as B.1.351 -- although efficacy went down if HIV-positive volunteers were included.
Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline
This is also a protein subunit vaccine, using Sanofi's FluBlok technology with a GlaxoSmithKline adjuvant. It also uses a baculovirus to grow little bits of spike protein.
Phase 1/2 trials showed the vaccine elicits an immune response in younger adults that's comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19, but the vaccine did not produce the desired immune response in older adults. The companies plan to launch a new trial in February.
Sinovac and Sinopharm
Chinese company Sinovac's CoronaVac uses an inactivated virus -- one of the oldest methods for vaccinating people. Whole batches of coronavirus are grown, ""killed"" and then made into vaccine. Likewise, Sinopharm's vaccine uses an inactivated virus.
China's Center for Disease Control said this week that tests showed the Sinopharm vaccine was effective against the B.1.351 variant.
Sputnik V
Russian researchers were heavily criticized for rolling out the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine last year without providing any data to show it was safe or effective.
On Tuesday, interim data from a Phase 3 trial were finally published in the Lancet medical journal and showed the vaccine is 91.6% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% effective for preventing severe illness.
The vaccine is a two-dose adenoviral vector vaccine, with doses administered 21 days apart. It uses two common cold viruses called adenovirus 5 and adenovirus 26 to carry the genetic material for the spike protein into the body.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/2/3/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-reduce-transmission.html,"AstraZeneca vaccine appears to substantially reduce transmission of the coronavirus, study shows",Michael Nedelman and Laura Smith-Spark,2021-02-03 21:57:34,"(CNN) -- The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine appears to substantially reduce transmission of the virus, rather than simply preventing symptomatic infections, UK researchers have suggested.
The rate of positive PCR tests declined by about half after two doses, according to preliminary results by researchers at the University of Oxford that have yet to be peer reviewed.
Their analysis, released as a preprint Tuesday, also supports spacing out doses and estimates good efficacy after just one shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.
The study did not measure transmission directly -- for example, by tracing contacts who were infected by study volunteers. But the researchers did collect regular nasal swabs from some participants and found that the rate of positive PCR tests fell by half after two doses of the vaccine. After one dose only, the rate of positive tests fell by 67%.
ADVERTISEMENT
""While transmission studies per se were not included in the analysis, swabs were obtained from volunteers every week in the UK study, regardless of symptoms, to allow assessment of the overall impact of the vaccine on risk of infection and thus a surrogate for potential onward transmission,"" the authors write.
If the vaccine were simply making infections milder, PCR positivity would not change, the authors argued in the preprint analysis. ""A measure of overall PCR positivity is appropriate to assess whether there is a reduction in the burden of infection.""
Coronavirus vaccine trials have primarily looked at prevention of symptomatic cases of COVID-19. Previously, there has been little other public data suggesting that vaccines could prevent people from passing the infection to others.
Speaking to the UK's Science Media Centre (SMC), Helen Fletcher, professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the data in the study ""suggest a possibility that the vaccine could have an impact on transmission but further follow-up would be needed to confirm this.""
Dr. Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, told the SMC the study ""hints that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine may be effective in stopping people being able to transmit the virus.""
He added: ""While this would be extremely welcome news, we do need more data before this can be confirmed and so it's important that we all still continue to follow social distancing guidance after we have been vaccinated.""
Dose spacing
The vaccine showed 66.7% efficacy against symptomatic disease starting two weeks after the second shot, researchers at the University of Oxford said.
The new analysis adds new trial sites and a month of new data to the mix, building upon earlier results announced by AstraZeneca that its vaccine had showed an estimated 70.4% efficacy.
However, the latest research also suggests the vaccine may offer substantial protection after a single shot.
The study estimates 76% efficacy up to three months following one dose. This is based on a subset of 88 symptomatic infections, split unevenly between the vaccine and placebo groups between 22 and 90 days after vaccination. The study also found relatively stable levels of antibodies during this time frame, ""with minimal waning by day 90.""
Furthermore, the authors suggest there could be higher efficacy with more spaced-out doses. Among adults age 18 to 55, vaccine efficacy appeared to rise when the time between shots was spaced out from less than six weeks to more than 12. However, more information is needed to know how statistically different that finding is.
Taken together, the findings may bolster the UK's decision to recommend spacing out doses up to 12 weeks apart, according to a statement from the chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial and co-author of the paper, Andrew Pollard.
""This is positive news as it shows that just one dose of this vaccine generates good levels of immunity and that this protection does not seem to wane in the shorter term,"" said Brown, of the British Society for Immunology.
""In immunology terms, this finding is not unexpected as we know that some other vaccines confer better immunity when the doses are more spread out. Although further information is required to confirm these findings for older age groups, overall this new research should provide reassurance around the UK's decision to offer the two doses of this vaccine 12 weeks apart.""
Similar data is not yet available on delaying the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to 12 weeks after the first dose, said Dr. Gillies O'Bryan-Tear, past chair of policy and communications at the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine in comments to the SMC. But, he added, ""most commentators agree that it is likely to be the same with that vaccine, and indeed, other two dose vaccines.""
The authors caveat that the trials were not initially designed to evaluate efficacy by dose intervals, but the data ""arose due to the logistics of running large-scale clinical trials in a pandemic setting.""
The primary analysis is based on 332 symptomatic infections that occurred among more than 17,000 trial volunteers in the UK, Brazil and South Africa more than two weeks after their second dose.
AstraZeneca announced last month it had completed enrollment in its Phase 3 trial in the United States, which will serve as ""the primary basis"" for the company's eventual application to the US Food and Drug Administration.
The vaccine has already been authorized in a number countries, such as the UK and India, but authorization may not come in the US until late March at the earliest, according to Operation Warp Speed's Moncef Slaoui.

The vaccine was 72% effective against moderate and severe disease in the US, the company said.
It's a striking difference from vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and it may give pause to people uncertain about which vaccine to get or when they can get one. The vaccines already on the market in the US are about 95% effective overall against symptomatic COVID-19, with perhaps even higher efficacy against severe cases.
But experts say the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will still be useful against the pandemic in the United States and around the world.
""Among all participants from different geographies and including those infected with an emerging viral variant, Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine candidate was 66% effective overall at preventing the combined endpoints of moderate and severe COVID-19, 28 days after vaccination. The onset of protection was observed as early as day 14,"" the company said in a statement.
Janssen is Johnson & Johnson's vaccine arm.
ADVERTISEMENT
""The level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the US, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa, 28 days post-vaccination.""
""We're 85% effective at preventing severe disease, which we define as disease that makes you feel particularly sick at home, or may go to the hospital, or worse,"" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development at Johnson & Johnson, told CNN.
""And we are right now completely protective, it would appear 100% protective, against disease that actually does make you go to the hospital, we're 100% protective against death.""
The company said the results held up across all age groups and people of various ethnicities.
Mammen said the company was working to file for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration ""inside of a week."" It will be the third company to seek EUA from the FDA for a coronavirus vaccine. Vaccines made by Moderna and by Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized in December and are now being given to millions of Americans.
Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said that under normal circumstances, there might not be much of a market for a vaccine that is significantly less effective than two others already on the market. But he added that these are not normal times, with a pandemic raging and shortage of vaccines.
Pfizer and Moderna both use genetic technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA technology. Johnson & Johnson uses a weakened common cold virus, known as adenovirus, to carry genetic instructions into the body to prompt an immune response.
""In a better world, we would have abundant quantities of this messenger RNA vaccine, Pfizer and Moderna, and that would be damning for a vaccine that's clearly less effective. But that said, we have limited quantities of mRNA vaccine,"" Offit said.
Offit has been vaccinated, but said if he had not, he would first search out a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, and then if he couldn't find one in reasonable period of time, he would take a Johnson & Johnson vaccine if it was available.Offit said getting one brand of vaccine and later on getting a different vaccine should not pose safety issues.
""I would make an effort to get an mRNA vaccine first,"" Offit said. ""Not being able to get it, and knowing I might not be able to get Pfizer or Moderna for many months, and knowing this virus is still ranging across the country, I would take J&J in the secure knowledge that I could get Pfizer or Moderna later.""
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has advantages, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
""A vaccine that's inexpensive, that's a single dose, and that has no cold chain requirements -- that's pretty good,"" Fauci told CNN.
Plus no cases of severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis were seen in any of the volunteers, the company said.
Fauci said the results would look even better if Janssen did not have to compete against the 94% and 95% efficacy seen in trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
""You know what the problem is? If this were out there and we didn't have the Moderna 94-95% .... We would have said wow, a 72% effective vaccine that's even more effective against severe disease is really terrific,"" he said in a telephone interview.
""But now we're always judging it against 94 to 95%. Having said that, this is a vaccine that could have use particularly in developing countries to keep people out of the hospital. It has a very good efficacy against severe disease,"" Fauci added.
Mammen said the Janssen vaccine was tested later, after new variants of coronavirus were already circulating. One in particular, called B.1.135, was dominant in South Africa when the vaccine was tested there. This variant has mutations that might be expected to weaken the vaccine's effects somewhat.
But it still protected people, Mammen said.
""I'm looking at that South African variant, and I'm seeing that we're able to completely protect against concerning levels of illness, where one might go to a hospital,"" he said.
Plus people do not have to worry about coming back for a second dose.
""We really wanted it to be a single dose. So we optimized our antigen so that we get enough immunogenicity after one dose, as opposed to two,"" he said.
""If it's a single-dose vaccine, then a billion vaccine doses would translate into a billion people vaccinated,"" said Dr. Dan Barouch of Harvard Medical School, who helped develop the vaccine.
And, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, it does not have to be stored in freezers. It can be stored for three months at refrigerator temperatures of 36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.
Janssen is already testing a two-dose regimen of the vaccine and that could increase the efficacy, Fauci said.
""Let's see what that shows. It could possibly bring it up to 90%,"" he said. ""Heck if you got 72 with a single dose, you would think you would do pretty good with a boost.""
The US federal government has contracted to buy 100 million doses of the vaccine and the company has been manufacturing doses for months in anticipation that it would work and would win EUA from the FDA.
A fourth vaccine is also jostling to join the mix in the US market. Maryland-based Novavax released preliminary data Thursday showing its candidate vaccine had an efficacy of 89% in trials in Britain. And AstraZeneca is finishing up Phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine, as well.
The Janssen vaccine is made a little differently from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which use raw genetic material called messenger RNA.
This one is a viral vector vaccine. It uses a common cold virus called adenovirus 26, which has been weakened so that it does not replicate in the body. It's engineered to carry genetic material from the spike protein of the virus -- that's the part the virus uses to grab onto the cells it targets.
The vaccine prompts the muscle cells in the arm to produce these pieces of spike protein. The immune system recognizes them as foreign and builds a defense, so when a real virus tries to infect, the body is ready to fight it off.

Two doses of the vaccine “is expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date,” according to the release.
The company’s study showed that the variant first found in the UK had “no significant impact” on the vaccine’s effectiveness.
The results for the variant first spotted in South Africa, however, were not as optimistic — and some early studies have suggested vaccines may be somewhat less effective against this strain.

In the press release, Moderna noted that “a six-fold reduction in neutralizing titers was observed with (the variant discovered in South Africa) relative to prior variants.”
The company said the vaccine was still expected to be effective.
“Despite this reduction, neutralizing titer levels with (the variant discovered in South Africa) remain above levels that are expected to be protective,” according to the press release.
David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center, said while he’s “cautiously optimistic” Moderna’s vaccine will work well against this strain, he’s still not sure.
“The efficacy might be reduced somewhat, but it may still be very effective,” he said. “Hopefully the vaccine will still be 70-80% effective.”
The variant first identified in the UK has also appeared in more than 45 other countries, including 195 cases in the US.
The variant first identified in South Africa has appeared in more than 20 other countries. No cases have been identified in the US, but experts say it’s likely there are cases and US surveillance, which has been widely criticized, has not yet found them.

Britain is prioritizing giving more of its most at-risk citizens a first dose of a vaccine, and has delayed appointments for a second jab.
But the decision has been debated in the medical community, and the chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) urged ministers to follow the ""best practice"" and cut the wait time to six weeks for the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.
Pfizer/BioNTech recommend the second dose takes place 21 days after the first, and have said there's no data to support a 12-week gap.
""What we're saying is that the UK should adopt this best practice based on international professional opinion,"" BMA chairman Dr. Chaand Nagpaul told the BBC on Saturday. The organization has sent a letter to the UK's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, warning against the delay.
""Most nations in the world are facing challenges similar to the UK, in having limited vaccine supply and also wanting to protect their population maximally,"" Nagpaul added. ""No other nation has adopted the UK's approach.""
In a statement to CNN, a BMA spokesperson said the letter informs Whitty of ""the growing concern from the medical profession regarding the delay of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as the UK's strategy has become increasingly isolated from many other countries.""
ADVERTISEMENT
The group told CNN they were also concerned about the availability of the vaccine in the coming weeks, saying their members feel that ""given the unpredictability of supplies, there may not be any guarantees that second doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be available in 12 weeks' time.""
""The Association is urging the (Chief Medical Officer) to urgently review the UK's current position of second doses after 12 weeks,"" they said.
Britain is vaccinating its citizens at one of the quickest rates in the world, thanks partly to its spread-out dosing strategy. More than 5 million Brits have received at least one dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and more than 400,000 people are receiving the jab on a daily basis.
Public Health England's medical director Yvonne Doyle defended the plan, telling the BBC on Saturday it was necessary to bring the virus under control.
""The more people that are protected against this virus, the less opportunity it has to get the upper hand. Protecting more people is the right thing to do,"" she said.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been in use in the UK since early December, when it became the first country in the world to approve it.
When Britain first announced its plans, Pfizer said it did not have data to demonstrate that just a single dose of its vaccine would provide protection against the disease after more than 21 days.
""Pfizer and BioNTech's Phase 3 study for the Covid-19 vaccine was designed to evaluate the vaccine's safety and efficacy following a 2-dose schedule, separated by 21 days,"" Pfizer said in a statement last month. ""There are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.""
But the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland explained the move in a letter to health care professionals after the vaccine was approved, saying it was based on the ""balance of risks and benefits,"" and that the ""great majority"" of initial protection came from the first jab.
The debate comes as Covid-19 deaths soar in the UK. While new cases are declining since Britain went into a third lockdown this month, the country reported its highest-ever daily fatality toll on Wednesday, with 1,820 deaths, giving a total of 97,517, according to John Hopkins University.

This, as Vice President Leni Robredo earlier said the move could boost Filipinos' confidence in vaccines.

[Translation: The matter is being discussed already... Let's let him decide.]
On Saturday, Robredo said vaccinating Duterte first will help strengthen public trust in the government's vaccination program against the coronavirus. Of 2,400 Filipino adults surveyed by Pulse Asia last November 23 to December 2, 47% said they were not willing to get vaccinated due to safety concerns.
Roque stressed the national government did not really expect to earn the confidence of Filipinos when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines, saying many are on a wait-and-see mode before they opt to get vaccinated.
But he said the government is ""in no rush"" since only 50,000 to 100,000 doses are expected to arrive in the Philippines next month.
In August last year, Duterte himself offered to be the first person to receive a COVID-19 vaccine from Russia to prove its effectiveness.
When asked what vaccine is recommended for the President, infectious diseases expert Rontgene Solante, who was also present during the briefing, said all three vaccines—Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca—are ""safe to be given regardless of age.""
Roque stressed Duterte's own vaccination plan is ""solely between him and his doctor.""
The top priority sectors of the vaccination program include the 'poorest of the poor', and the police and military, Duterte previously said.

While concerns were raised after over 20 died in Norway after receiving doses from US-based drugmaker Pfizer, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said he was quite optimistic the news would not further dampen vaccine confidence in the Philippines.
""I hope not,"" he told CNN Philippines in a text message, when asked if the news could affect Filipinos' trust in the vaccine.
""This shows that the vaccine recipients are being monitored closely and all events are investigated and recommendations are updated regularly,"" Domingo added.
Of the 2,400 Filipino adults surveyed by Pulse Asia last Nov. 23 to Dec. 2, 47 percent said they were not willing to get vaccinated against the virus due to safety concerns.
According to a Bloomberg report, the deaths among elderly people in Norway were linked to Pfizer's vaccine.
Quoting the Norwegian Medicines Agency, it said they ""have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, such as nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition.""

Pfizer boasts that its phase 3 clinical trials showed that the vaccine was 95 percent effective in preventing infections after a person received two shots.
The country has yet to secure vaccine procurement deals with the US pharmaceutical company, but vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government expects to receive more or less 40 million doses this year.
Domingo said the FDA was still waiting for Pfizer's reports before they decide whether to put an age cap on the recipients.

""I'm also very happy to announce that it is Pfizer's intention to make available its COVID-19 vaccine to low-income countries like the Philippines at a not-for-profit price during the pandemic,"" said Andreas Quercia, Pfizer country manager during the Senate Committee on the Whole's hearing on the national COVID-19 vaccination plan Friday.
Pfizer also said it is in ""advance discussions"" with the Philippine government on a supply agreement for its COVID-19 vaccine, adding it plans to make doses available to the country as soon as possible. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., meanwhile, said there might already be a term sheet and supply agreement with the pharmaceutical firm within next week.
The official also said Pfizer vaccine doses may reach the Philippines as early as the first quarter of 2021 through the help of the COVAX facility, of which the country is part of. The facility purchases vaccines to be distributed for free to developing countries, covering a maximum of 20% of their respective populations.
Pfizer is the first to secure Emergency Use Authorization in the Philippines for a coronavirus vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration granted the approval Thursday, citing the vaccine's high efficacy rate.
Pfizer earlier bagged EUAs across the globe, including from the United States and the United Kingdom.
Agreements with Sinovac, other firms not a 'done deal'
When asked whether agreements the country has entered into in advance for vaccine supply with firms like China-based Sinovac are already a ""done deal,"" Galvez said that is not the case.
""Ang sa atin pa lang po ngayon [For now,] we are [just] dealing with the term sheet. Posible rin [It could also be possible] we have to lock (the supply), so that they can already make production. So sa ngayon po, wala pa pong government funds tayong naibibigay,"" clarified the official.
[Translation: As of now, we haven't given out government funds yet.]
National policy against COVID-19 deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon also reiterated the country's vaccine expert panel has recommended seven vaccine brands for possible purchase, which includes Sinovac. However, none of this is final yet, as the government awaits the panel's final recommendation, along with an EUA from the FDA.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/1/13/sinovac-covid-vaccine-efficacy.html,"Chinese Covid-19 vaccine far less effective than initially claimed in Brazil, sparking concerns",Nectar Gan and Tatiana Arias,2021-01-13 19:18:42,"(CNN) -- A leading Chinese Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech was just 50.38% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil, significantly lower than earlier results showed, according to a statement published by the government of Sao Paulo Tuesday.
While the number exceeds the threshold required for regulatory approval, it falls far below the 78% previously announced, raising questions as to the veracity of the data and fueling skepticism over the apparent lack of transparency regarding Chinese vaccines.
Analysts said the efficacy rate of Sinovac's Coronavac vaccine in Brazil -- the lowest among its global competitors -- could affect international confidence in Chinese-made vaccines and hamper Beijing's effort to repair its image from its early mishandling of the initial outbreak by providing Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries.
""The Butantan Institute and the Government of Sao Paulo report that the coronavirus vaccine achieved a 50.38% overall efficacy rate in the clinical study conducted in Brazil, in addition to (an efficacy rate of) 78% for mild cases and 100% for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19. All rates are higher than the 50% level required by the WHO (World Health Organization),"" the statement released Tuesday said.
The razor-thin margin for regulatory approval is likely to lead to concern among scientists, given that last week the Butantan institute released partial ""clinical efficacy"" results celebrating 78% to 100% efficacy in preventing infections.
The state body financed the phase 3 trials of the vaccine, which involved 13,000 health workers across eight Brazilian states.
""Regarding the overall efficacy of the analysis, we met the requirements of the World Health Organization with 50.38%,"" Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at the Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo said Tuesday during a news conference.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, on Tuesday, high-ranking members of the Brazilian Health Ministry told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil that ""the effectiveness is borderline,"" and that because ""It is at the limit. We have to wait for ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) to evaluate.""
A representative of Sinovac said the company is discussing the result but declined to give further comment. The final efficacy rate of the vaccine will be determined by China's drug regulator, the National Medical Production Administration, according to the representative.
Potential stumbling block
Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the US based Council on Foreign Relations, described the 50.38% efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine as a ""disappointing"" result that had caught him by surprise.
The results suggest Coronavac is less effective than alternative vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have an efficacy rate of about 95%.
Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 91% effective, while the UK's vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has an average efficacy of 70%.
The Sinovac vaccine is also less effective than its domestic Chinese competitor, developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, which it says is 79.34% effective.
Despite the worse than anticipated results, Huang said the Sinovac vaccine would still be ""usable"" by helping to relieve pressures on healthcare systems while reducing potential deaths, given its higher efficacy for moderate and severe cases that would require medical treatment.
However, its low overall efficacy could hinder Sinovac's ability to expand its market share globally, Huang said.
Sinovac has signed deals to provide 46 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to Brazil, 50 million doses to Turkey and 7.5 million doses to Hong Kong. It'll also supply 40 million doses of vaccine bulk -- the vaccine concentrate before it is divided into vials -- to Indonesia for local production.
""Since many countries are planning to order, or have already ordered Sinovac's vaccines, it might undermine people's willingness to take them, because people may question the usefulness of the vaccines,"" Huang said. ""It could be a potential stumbling block.""
Lack of transparency
A lack of transparency has been a major concern clouding Chinese-made vaccines, which Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to make ""a global public good.""
Both Sinovac and Sinopharm have faced questions regarding the release of data. When announcing its efficacy results, state-owned Sinopharm did not provide details on its clinical trial data. A Sinopharm executive said detailed data would be released later and published in scientific journals, without giving a timeline.
There is also the issue of discrepancy in results from clinical trials conducted in different places.
Having largely eliminated the coronavirus inside its borders earlier last year, Chinese drugmakers had to look abroad for places to test the efficacy of their vaccines. But the results reported so far are far from consistent.
Sinopharm's efficacy rate of 79%, for example, is lower than the 86% announced by the United Arab Emirates for the same vaccine in December.
Sinovac's vaccine has had wildly different results from three countries: Indonesian drug regulators say interim data from Phase 3 trials showed it is 65.3% effective and gave it the country's first emergency use approval; Turkey says it is 91.25% effective; And in Brazil, the two significantly different efficacy rates announced a week apart have further sparked questions.
Last week, Brazil's health regulator agency ANVISA told the Butantan Institute that in order to approve the emergency use of a vaccine, the global efficacy rate had to be made publicly available -- information the Institute had not received at the time from Sinovac, according to CNN Brasil sources.
ANVISA will meet on Sunday to decide on two requests for emergency use of both the Coronavac vaccine and the Oxford University AstraZeneca vaccine.
Domestic expectations
The news could potentially hinder China's own coronavirus vaccination drive too, Huang warned.
China has inoculated tens of thousands of people with Sinovac's vaccine since July under a government-approved emergency use program, which includes at least three Chinese vaccine candidates.
In total, it has administered 4.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine under emergency use, and is planning to vaccinate 50 million people ahead of February's Lunar New Year celebrations.
Chinese public health experts have repeatedly told the public they are confident that Chinese-made vaccines are at least as good as, if not better, than foreign alternatives, Huang said.
""If people learn about this, they might start to question the safety and efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine, or even other Chinese-made vaccines,"" Huang said. ""I think the government will need to do some convincing work, on either those who have already taken the shots, or are about to do so.""

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/1/12/cherokee-nation-covid-vaccine.html,"Only about 2,000 people speak the Cherokee language fluently. The tribe is saving some vaccine doses for them",Harmeet Kaur,2021-01-12 21:06:23,"(CNN) -- Even before the pandemic hit, the Cherokee Nation was dealing with a crisis: the potential disappearance of its native language.
Only about 2,000 people alive on this earth can speak the Cherokee language fluently. And as Covid-19 began to spread, that number started to dwindle.
So when the Cherokee Nation began receiving shipments of the Covid-19 vaccine, the tribal government identified Cherokee speakers as among the first groups to be eligible for the shot.
""When you lose a speaker and you're a tribe that has only 2,000 fluent speakers left, you've lost something that isn't just irreplaceable, as all life is, but is really a national treasure,"" Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. told CNN. ""Whether they survive and whether they pass down their knowledge will help determine in a couple of generations if there is a Cherokee language left.""
Vaccinating Cherokee language speakers alongside frontline health care workers is just the latest effort the tribe has made during the pandemic to keep this treasured population safe.
And in doing so, the Cherokee Nation is not only protecting some of most revered citizens, but also ensuring the survival of its culture and identity.
About 30 Cherokee speakers have died of Covid-19
In relative terms, the Cherokee Nation has fared much better than other tribes and many parts of the US in controlling the spread of the virus.

The Cherokee Nation, with about 141,000 citizens living on its reservation in northeastern Oklahoma, has reported a total of more than 11,800 Covid-19 cases and 66 deaths as of January 8. But about 30 of the people lost were native Cherokee speakers, Hoskin said.
""When I took office, preserving our language and revitalizing it was a high priority,"" he said. ""In the midst of Covid, knowing what we're losing, it just tells me that that's the right priority and we need to emphasize it even more.""
The first 975 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine arrived in the Cherokee Nation on December 14. The next morning, the tribe started vaccinating frontline health care workers at its health complex in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.
Three days later, the tribe began administering the shot to Cherokee language speakers.
The Cherokee Nation already had a record of its living first language speakers, thanks to an effort Hoskin initiated in 2018 when he was the tribe's Secretary of State. So its staff started contacting those listed in the speaker roll book to let them know they could now schedule an appointment to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.
More than 600 speakers have been vaccinated so far, according to the tribe. The aim is to vaccinate 1,000 by the end of the week.
On January 4, the Cherokee Nation also announced it was beginning vaccinations for elders aged 65 and older.
Prioritizing the vaccination of Cherokee speakers and elders has also had an unintended consequence: It has built trust in the vaccine among other citizens of the Cherokee Nation.
Hoskin said he's seen some hesitation among Cherokee Nation citizens about taking the vaccine. But the tribe's decision to vaccinate native speakers early helped ease the anxieties that some people might have otherwise had, he added.
""People revere elders in the Cherokee Nation,"" he said. ""I think when they saw that group of people being made a high priority and celebrating it, that surely has built some confidence.""
She's seen the pandemic's toll firsthand
Sandra Turner got her first vaccine dose in December and received her booster shot last week.
Turner, 64, grew up speaking Cherokee at home in a family of 11 children. Until about first or second grade, she didn't even know English. And even then, she and the many other Cherokee students at her school would speak to each other in the language they knew best.
Today, people like her are rare.
Turner, who lives in Salina, Oklahoma, knows firsthand the threat that Covid-19 poses to her mother tongue. Just last week, she attended the funeral of her children's father, who died of the virus and spoke the language fluently like herself.
So when Turner received an email informing her that she could receive the Covid-19 vaccine, she says she was grateful.
""We have been losing a lot of our fluent speakers due to the virus,"" she said. ""And I was ready. I said, 'I'm getting in line.'""
As one of the few people left whose first language was Cherokee, John Ross, 65, says he felt a responsibility to get the shot as soon as it was available to him.
Ross, who lives in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, is a translator for the Cherokee Nation. He's actively worked to preserve the language he grew up with, including getting Cherokee on Microsoft Office programs and making vaccine information from Pfizer and Moderna available in Cherokee. And it's important that that work continues.
""As a Cherokee speaker, there's probably less than 2,000 speakers left like me that's alive on the face of this earth,"" he said. ""They want to keep us as long as we can because we try to help out to preserve our language to the young ones or whoever wants to learn.""
Fortunately for those interested in learning Cherokee, Ross received his final dose of the vaccine last week.

About 2,221 people remain hospitalized with the virus, more than 500 of whom are in intensive care units.
The county is currently vaccinating people who fall under Phase 1a — critical and healthcare workers as well as people 75 years and older. Those who meet the criteria must schedule an appointment to be vaccinated at a Super POD site, the county said.

Vatican says vaccine is 'morally acceptable'
In December, the Vatican deemed that it was morally acceptable to be vaccinated against COVID-19, after some anti-abortion groups raised concerns about how the vaccines were manufactured.
Some groups had suggested the coronavirus vaccines were made using cells from aborted fetuses. The cells are actually engineered and grown in labs from tissue acquired many decades ago, and are not made directly from aborted fetuses.
""It is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process,"" the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said in a note approved by Francis.
The statement was issued and signed by the head of the Congregation in response to several requests for guidelines regarding the use of the vaccine.
The pontiff used his recent Christmas message to say that coronavirus vaccines must be available for all, and pleaded with states to cooperate in the race to emerge from the pandemic.

Sometimes it comes back without her trying to remember.
What happened March 4 before the dawn and into the night haunts her.
The sirens seemed to blare endlessly outside the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington.
""That was the night (we had) like five ambulances in the parking lot,"" she said.
It was the night she sent patients to the hospital whom she expected would be treated and eventually released. They never came back.
It was the date she figured out ""the whole cascade of symptoms"" of a virus the nursing home learned had invaded just four days earlier.
It was also the day she had to make some gut-wrenching phone calls.
ADVERTISEMENT
One at 3 a.m. she can't shake from her mind. She remembers the conversation with the woman on the other end of the line.
""I realized this was early in the morning, and this is very difficult to say that I am really sorry that your mom has passed away,"" Earnest said. ""I cried with her.""
The two, who had never met, shared a heartbreaking moment. Ten months later, they still sometimes talk, Earnest said.
Earnest, a registered nurse, volunteered to help out the Kirkland nursing home from her position as a nursing director at another Life Care Center in the state.
They needed all the help they could get. Nearly 70% of the staff had tested positive for coronavirus in March.
She had no idea that the inconspicuous building on a tree-lined street in a quiet residential neighborhood in Kirkland would become America's first epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
Eventually the state department of health reported 46 people linked to the nursing home died of coronavirus; 39 of them were patients. Ten patients died at the nursing home itself, Earnest said.
""It was like chasing a ghost,"" she told CNN in March. ""You're in a battlefield where supplies are limited. The help's slow to get to you and there's lots of casualties. And you can't see the enemy.""
Ten months since the initial outbreak, she and other frontline health care workers here are finally getting the best weapon available to battle the virus: the vaccine.
Alice Cortez, a nursing manager at Life Care Center of Kirkland, was the first to get the vaccine here.
""This is an exciting day for everybody especially my team,"" she said as her voice cracked with emotion.
""What I feel right now is a new life, a new beginning, but a better life.""
One by one, nurses, a doctor and other frontline workers at the facility came outside to get their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That vaccine was the first to get emergency approval by the FDA.
Coronavirus remains a threat at nursing homes
But everyone here is well aware that the virus is still raging and remains a threat to the most vulnerable people: The people they are charged with caring for.
For now, the Kirkland nursing home has no positive coronavirus cases. But of the 26 Life Care Center nursing homes in the region, eight facilities have Covid-19 cases right now. At one point this year, 24 of the 26 did.
As of December 13, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees nursing homes, says 441,000 nursing home patients have tested positive for coronavirus across the United States and 86,775 nursing home residents have died from Covid-19. And 1,258 staff members have perished, too.
""There is not a day that goes by where I don't get a phone call or a message that we have a new positive patient or staff,"" said Nancy Butner, vice president of Life Care Centers of America Northwest division. Butner said some of her staff have been hospitalized recently. And more patients have died in other facilities.
""It is relentless,"" Butner said.
Initially, some families and the public blamed the nurses, doctors and staff at Life Care Center of Kirkland for the outbreak and not controlling it better.
The phones never stopped ringing. Families couldn't get through -- sometimes doctors couldn't -- because of other unwanted calls.
""It was very hard to go into a patient's room and hear the phone. And you think it's a doctor, and you get there and it's some person saying they have the cure for Covid giving you a recipe that is as crazier than they are,"" Earnst said.
Too often, it was the most jarring kind of call: death threats, enough to require security. Earnest was afraid to go to her car one night after treating patients.
""My husband said, 'Make sure you have your gun,'"" she said, able to laugh about it now. But he was serious and so were the threats.
Then there was the sight of the devastated families who showed up every day.
Some had lost their mom or dad at the facility, and others had family still inside infected with Covid-19. They sat in chairs outside their family member's room window, eating lunch with them and having muffled conversations through the glass.
Inside, the staff was dealing with a virus no one knew enough about.
It was before the public was told to wear masks, before the elbow bump became the new handshake, before all of the symptoms were known. And it was before tens of thousands of people began getting sick and dying in New York City, which soon became the second epicenter of the virus.
In April, state and federal agencies that oversee nursing homes also blamed Life Care Center of Kirkland. The federal report said: ""inspectors found three 'Immediate Jeopardy' situations, which are situations in which a patient's safety is placed in imminent danger.""
Life Care Center appealed the ruling. In September, a state administrative judge largely sided with the Life Care Center of Kirkland, not the state findings, which mimicked the federal ones.
The judge said the state agency ""provided relatively little evidence that the facility actually failed to meet any expected standard of care or failed to follow public health guidelines.""
The federal appeal has not been decided.
Changes made since the March outbreak
In the beginning, there were not enough coronavirus tests, and it took days to get results. Now, they have rapid tests that take minutes.
In some rooms, there were three patients. Now, that's down to one -- or two if they can be properly distanced.
Before the virus, the facility accepted as many as 124 patients. Now they've capped it at 97.
Back then, there was a constant worry about a lack of personal protective equipment. Now, a nearby facility has a large room stuffed with boxes of masks, gloves and other gear.
But 10 months after the initial viral outbreak, the chairs for family members remain outside the windows of the rooms. Room numbers are scrawled on the windows.
That has become a semi-permanent fixture because visitors still aren't allowed inside.
There is no family hand-holding or hugs and kisses. It is simply too dangerous, the virus too contagious. The staff knows that now.
In the beginning, Earnest, a registered nurse, was informing doctors and members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of what she was seeing in patients. Now, they get constant updates and new safety protocols from government agencies.
Covid-19 impacts staff inside and outside the nursing home
Butner says what people don't often think about is that the staff has to battle the virus at work and at home.
Earnest lost an uncle to Covid-19 this year. So before Christmas she had to have ""the talk"" with her mother about how she wanted to die.
""If she got it, what did she want? Did she want to be on a ventilator or did she want to be ... let go?""
It was the hardest conversation she's had with family. But she says she couldn't avoid it. No one should.
It is too awful when they are taken away and isolated and you don't get to know their wishes. Sometimes you don't get to say goodbye, she said.
Earnest said she hopes the vaccine will make these conversations less urgent. But not everybody at the nursing facilities is looking forward to getting it.
""We did a survey with the staff at our facilities before we did education on the vaccine. Twenty percent said no, never. They would not get vaccinated,"" she said.
For now, she says, Life Care Centers of America isn't making it mandatory. The reason is simple.
""We simply could not lose 20% of our staff,"" she said. ""Another effect of this virus is an extreme shortage of nursing staff for all of health care.""
She is hoping that with education, the percentage will shrink.
For physician's assistant Christy Carmichael, her decision to get the vaccine made everyone gasp. Last week she had promised one of her patients who had survived Covid-19 that she would be able get the vaccine.

Speaking to CNN Philippines' The Source on Tuesday, AFP spokesperson Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo urged the country's regulatory bodies to speed up their screening process and make the vaccine readily available for the public, including the military personnel, whom he repeatedly described as ""frontliners.""
""We hope that the other agencies of the government in charge of the regulation will fast-track the so-called emergency use authorization so that there will be no more issues with regard to the administration of the vaccine because it is very essential and necessary, especially to the members of the AFP, who will be performing their duties in the frontlines,"" Arevalo said.
He added that the military is willing to follow regulations, but ""owing to the nature of their duties and responsibilities,"" regulators must ""take the lead"" in the provision of vaccines for them.

""If it comes necessary that we perform our duties as frontliners when the vaccines are already available, hopefully the other agencies of government that are in charge with the regulation would be the one to take the lead and would make the vaccine available to the military personnel who would be facing the frontlines,"" Arevalo said.
The military has recently drawn flak after admitting that members of the Presidential Security Group were inoculated against the virus. The FDA has not yet authorized any COVID-19 vaccine for rollout in the Philippines.
Uniformed personnel are supposed to be fifth in line among other groups prioritized for vaccination, following health workers, senior citizens, indigent senior citizens, and the rest of the indigent population.

Arevalo then defended the PSG, noting that part of their job is to protect Duterte, the chief executive and their commander-in-chief. He also stressed that the PSG should be acknowledged for taking the risks that come with getting the doses in advance.
""What we should look into is the recognition given, that we should accord to some members of the PSG because they themselves are aware of the risks involved. Be that as it may, in their duty to the President, they are willing to take the risk,"" he noted.
The AFP spokesperson then clarified that only the closed-in security and official escorts within the PSG, headed by BGen. Jesus Durante, received the doses. The ones in charge of the legal aspect of the issue should just discuss the matter further, he added.
Arevalo reiterated that he is not privy to the inoculation process, the type of vaccine received, and how it was given to the PSG. Other top officials and members of the AFP, including him, have not yet received the vaccine.
It was Duterte himself who bared in a Cabinet meeting on Saturday that some soldiers received Chinese vaccine Sinopharm, which does not have a regulatory approval to be distributed or administered in the Philippines.
Interior Secretary Eduardo Año then raised in a radio interview on Monday that he knows some PSG and even Cabinet members who got the unauthorized vaccine. Philippine Army chief Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana also confirmed this in a separate radio interview that some military men already got vaccinated, under Duterte's orders.

This is contrary, however, to what Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in a noontime briefing. When asked if the go signal came from the President, Roque said, ""I don't think so po. It must have been the decision of the commanders and the soldiers.""
In his address to the nation Saturday, Duterte bared that a number of military men already received the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm, which has not yet been given regulatory approval by the country's Food and Drug Administration.
Sobejana confirmed some AFP members have been vaccinated, but added he doesn't know from which firm the vaccines are.
Meanwhile, Presidential Security Group Commander Jesus Durante III said Duterte's close-in security personnel were the first ones among military men to be immunized. This is to ensure members of the PSG ""are not themselves threat to the President's health and safety,"" Durante said.

FDA Director General Eric Domingo said in an online interview that the application of Janssen Pharmaceuticals Company of Johnson and Johnson might be approved within the week or next week.
The applications of China’s Clover Biopharmaceutical and Sinovac Biotech may also be approved within January, once the remaining documents requested for evaluation are submitted.
“Ang Clover, I think they are just asking for documents, once those are completed that will also be released and approved,"" Domingo said. ""Ang Sinovac, may konting changes lang sa protocol na gusto gawin kaya nagkaron lang ng reevaluation.”
However, this does not mean that the trials will start as soon as the FDA approval is issued.
Domingo said it will still depend on the preparedness of the vaccine developer’s contract research organization in the country, since these are independent trials.
“After they get final approvals, may preparation din kasi ang clinical trials,"" he noted. ""Prepare ang hospital, community, and it takes a few weeks before they can actually inject in patients and do the clinical part of the trial.”

""To take an unapproved, unregulated vaccine is very, very dangerous,"" Dr. Edsel Salvana of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group said in a media forum on Sunday. ""I urge everyone to stay away from those, kasi (because) you are literally putting your life at risk if you take unregulated medicine, especially COVID vaccine.""
During Saturday's meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force and other health experts, President Rodrigo Duterte claimed that ""many"" citizens in the country have already been injected with China's Sinopharm vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration said raids have been conducted in Makati and Binondo, adding that no arrests have been made so far.
Salvana listed down the possible dangers of taking an unapproved vaccine, including lack of knowledge about the injected product, which he said would make it difficult for physicians to treat patients who may experience negative reactions.
""Say if you have a bad reaction. You don't even know kung ano 'yung binigay sayo eh (what was given to you)? So we wouldn't know what to treat you with,"" Salvana said. ""So there's really a lot of danger in doing those kinds of things. More than losing money, you could lose your life.""

US-based drug manufacturer Pfizer has also applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its coronavirus vaccine in the country.
""So all in all, sir, if we will get Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, J&J, and also Moderna, we might have more or less 80 million doses."" Galvez reported to Duterte.
According to Galvez, AstraZeneca, which previously offered 6.2 million doses, will likely be the first to secure the deal. This will be followed by Novavax, Pfizer, then Johnson & Johnson.
""We have also the discussion of the head of terms and also the supply of agreement and also with Moderna; and then followed by Gamaleya and also the Sinovac,"" he added.
President Rodrigo Duterte bared during the meeting that some Filipinos, including military men, were already inoculated with another China-based vaccine, Sinopharm, even without any approval for its use in the country.
""Marami na ang nagpa-injection dito sa Sinopharm (A lot of people here were already injected with Sinopharm here),"" Duterte said.
Galvez reiterated that the country is conducting a ""stringent"" screening of vaccines, as prescribed by international institutions like World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and Asian Investment Infrastructure Bank, which offer loans for their procurement.
""Gusto po naming i-announce sa ating mga kababayan na iyong pinipili po natin na vaccine is very safe and very effective considering that they will follow our stringent procedures...and of our fund manager, iyong tinatawag nating procurement agents, which are ADB, the World Bank and the AIIB.""

A few days ago, the government drew flak for claiming that Sinovac's vaccine is ""acceptable,"" and citing the World Health Organization's minimum threshold for effectivity. Brazilian researchers previously reported that Sinovac is just over 50% effective based on the country's recent trial data. However, full results of the trial have yet to be released.

Ang Probinsyano Party-list Rep. Ronnie Ong has filed House Bill 8280 which seeks to issue a vaccination passport as an identification system for those who got inoculated against COVID-19.
The bill, also known as the Vaccine Passport Act, was filed on December 17 but only shown to the media on Monday.
Under the bill, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, particularly the Departments of Health, Tourism, Foreign Affairs, Trade and Industry, and Transportation are mandated to ""coordinate and provide for a single internationally-recognized vaccine passport to serve as proof that a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19.""
ADVERTISEMENT
Ong said the passport will be issued ""as a matter of right whether or not the person availed of the free vaccination program of the government or was vaccinated through personal and other means.""
The agencies, in accordance with evidence-based or internationally-recognized policies, must also list down and regularly update the exemptions or activities allowed for vaccine passport holders such as, but not limited to the following:
- International and domestic travel, including non-essential travel
- Employment abroad
- Local checkpoint and quarantine exemptions
- Opening of and access to some business establishments; and
- Post-vaccination protocols applicable to vaccine passport holders, as may be determined by the IATF, in relation to rules on public gatherings, use of face mask and face shield
Business establishments may also decide to require people to show the vaccine passport until after the Department of Health declares that the virus has been totally eradicated, the bill noted.
""Although the COVID-19 inoculation is still a few months away from entering our borders, it is but proper to take further preparations and necessary steps for its unhampered implementation and maximization,"" Ong said.
He added: ""It is our hope that this bill will be considered and approved the soonest possible time before the possible roll out of the vaccine on June 2021 in order to restore people's trust and confidence to travel with the end view of reviving and bolstering our economy.""",CNN
http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/12/22/COVID-19-vaccine-myths.html,The most common COVID vaccine myths explored,Maggie Fox,2020-12-22 10:15:51,"(CNN) – How could the COVID-19 vaccine possibly be safe if it was produced, tested and authorized in record time? How can we trust anything backed by this administration?
Vaccines, especially, attracts myths and rumors and coronavirus vaccines seems to be fiction magnets.
Here are a few of the more common ones:
The COVID-19 vaccines were too rushed. We cannot know if they are safe.
It's true the vaccines being produced against coronavirus were created in record time. But that's not because they were rushed. It's because of careful preparation. The technology that underlies both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines -- the first two to get through the US regulatory process -- has been in the works for more than a decade and was made precisely for a pandemic situation.
This plug-and-play technology needs only the genetic code of a new virus, and that was available just days after the new coronavirus was identified and isolated.
Vaccines are usually slow to develop because -- contrary to popular belief -- they are not big money makers for pharmaceutical companies, so production doesn't ramp up unless there is a guaranteed market. In this case, the United States government paid billions up front so the companies would feel secure in going ahead and making vaccines at the same time they started the months-long process of clinical trials.
These trials went speedily because of the pandemic itself. So many people were getting infected across the country that it did not take long at all to tell whether the vaccine could protect people from infection. In addition, the hospitals and academic labs that did the testing sped up their own processes, fling paperwork daily, for instance, instead of waiting for weeks to file it in batches. And the US Food and Drug Administration scientists who reviewed the data worked seven days a week to review the information, dropping everything else to speed along their decisions.
ADVERTISEMENT
The companies themselves submit to outside experts called Data and Safety Monitoring Boards while the trials are ongoing.
Finally, the review was subject to outside eyes. The FDA submitted all the data to the independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, a group of mostly non-government, non-industry experts who reviewed the data. They overwhelmingly voted that both the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna vaccines are as effective and as safe as the companies who made them say they are.
Anyone who wants to can see the data. It's posted online, and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine for any expert to review and critique.
People who have allergies can't get the vaccines
It's true that people who have allergies to the specific ingredients in these vaccines should not get them. But that is a pretty short list, and might include ingredients such as polyethylene glycol. 
Old-fashioned flu vaccines are grown in eggs and some people with egg allergies were warned against getting some flu vaccine formulations -- but even flu vaccines have been reformulated in recent years and many are egg-free. The coronavirus vaccines are not made using eggs. They also do not contain preservatives that might trigger allergies.
""Honestly, anaphylaxis and other serious allergic reactions are considered a potential risk with every licensed vaccine,"" said Dr. Elissa Malkin, assistant research professor of Medicine at the George Washington University and a co-investigator on the Moderna vaccine clinical trial at GW.
""It is not surprising that as more people get vaccinated that allergic reactions would appear. We expect them to be uncommon and rare,"" Malkin told CNN.
No allergic reactions were seen in the clinical trials of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which involved just under 80,000 people. As they are rolled out among millions of people, more are likely to be seen, however.
One health worker who suffered an allergic reaction in Fairbanks, Alaska on Friday issued a statement saying she would be vaccinated again. ""Anaphylaxis is a rare but expected potential side effect that is treatable and does not have long term health implications like Covid,"" she said.
I would get the vaccine and recommend it to anyone, despite my reaction,"" she added.
""I've seen firsthand the suffering and death of COVID patients and my adverse reaction to the vaccine pales to what Covid infection can do to people.""
The vaccine will permanently change your DNA
This rumor may have started because the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both use genetic material. But they don't change DNA. They use RNA, which doesn't hang around in the body.
Former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Tom Frieden came up with this analogy:
""An mRNA vaccine doesn't actually contain the virus itself. Think of it as an email sent to your immune system that shows what the virus looks like, instructions to kill it, and then—like a Snapchat message—it disappears. Amazing technology,"" Frieden tweeted.
The vaccine is more dangerous than COVID-19
Brown University emergency room doctor Dr. Megan Ranney took this one on. She noted that at least 1% of people who catch coronavirus die of it. ""Another 10-20% are hospitalized. Another 30% or more have long lasting symptoms. The vaccine is far safer, with only minor temporary side effects,"" Ranney said on Twitter.
In both Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine trials, no worrying side-effects were seen. Covid-19 has killed more than 313,000 Americans -- more than 1.67 million people globally, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Coronavirus is just a myth
If it's a conspiracy, it's a good one. Tens of thousands of doctors and nurses around the world must be colluding in this lie. Every single government, the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the CDC and countless other organizations must be in on it.
Media organizations big and small must be in on this conspiracy and users of social media around the world must also be deciding to lie as they post pictures of their own suffering and that of loved ones who have suffered from this virus and been killed by it.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/12/22/Covid-vaccine-fetuses.html,Vatican OKs getting Covid-19 vaccines that used cell lines from aborted fetuses,John Allen,2020-12-22 08:02:19,"(CNN) — Being vaccinated against Covid-19 is morally acceptable, the Vatican deemed, after some anti-abortion groups raised concerns about how the vaccines were manufactured.
Some groups had suggested the coronavirus vaccines were made using cells from aborted fetuses. The cells are actually engineered and grown in labs from tissue acquired many decades ago, and are not made directly from aborted fetuses.
The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said in a note approved by Pope Francis on Monday that receiving the shot was morally permitted.
""It is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process,"" the note said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The statement was issued and signed by the head of the Congregation in response to several requests for guidelines regarding the use of the vaccine.
There have been some disagreements within the clergy regarding the ethics of taking a Covid-19 vaccine because it had used tissue retrieved from two abortions that took place in the last century.
The abortion connection, which had prompted a number of Bishops to voice their opposition to the vaccine, has now been rejected by the Vatican and by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops had already issued a statement earlier in the month stating that the use of Covid-19 vaccines is morally justified.
""Given the urgency of this crisis, the lack of available alternative vaccines, and the fact that the connection between an abortion that occurred decades ago and receiving a vaccine produced today is remote, inoculation with the new COVID-19 vaccines in these circumstances can be morally justified"".
The statement adds that receiving the vaccines do not indicate a cooperation with abortion, and that is not to be considered as an endorsement in any way.
""The licit use of such vaccines does not and should not in any way imply that there is a moral endorsement of the use of cell lines proceeding from aborted foetuses"".
The Vatican's statement is aimed at addressing the moral questions surrounding the vaccine and does not aim to judge the safety or effectiveness.
The statement also called on the governments, pharmaceutical companies, and international organisations to pay extra attention to the equitable distribution of the vaccine to the poorer countries.
""There is also a moral imperative for the pharmaceutical industry, governments and international organizations to ensure that vaccines, which are effective and safe from a medical point of view, as well as ethically acceptable, are also accessible to the poorest countries in a manner that is not costly for them,"" it said.

At a number of concierge medical practices in Southern California, doctors say they've received calls from their well-off clients asking if they can have early access to the extremely limited supply of vaccine doses in exchange for a financial contribution to a hospital or charity.
Dr. Jeff Toll, whose boutique internal medicine practice has admitting privileges at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said one patient offered to donate $25,000 to the hospital in exchange for an early shot of the vaccine. Toll's practice services a well-heeled clientele that includes chief executives and entertainment figures, but the doctor said he is telling his patients they too must wait as the first round of vaccines are distributed to those most in need of protection.
Earlier this week, California received 327,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, administering the first shots to front line health care workers battling the virus that has caused more than 22,000 deaths statewide since the start of the pandemic.
ADVERTISEMENT
""I think one of the difficult things is for physicians who take care of these high-power people to be able to say, no you have to wait,"" Toll said. ""These people don't usually have to wait.""
Toll said his practice has applied with the state of California to become a vaccine distribution center for his clients and has already purchased special ultra-cold freezers in anticipation of storing vials of the Pfizer vaccine.
'They wanted it yesterday'
Dr. David Nazarian, of My Concierge MD in Beverly Hills, said a number of his A-list clients are contacting him, saying that money is no object if it helps them get the vaccine early.
""They wanted it yesterday,"" said Nazarian. ""We will play by the rules but are doing everything we can to secure and distribute the vaccine when its available to us.""
Southern California has in recent weeks seen an unprecedented surge of new Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations, with hospital intensive care bed capacity plunging to 0% and health officials issuing dire warnings if the virus continues to spread out of control.
The founder of Concierge MD LA, Dr. Abe Malkin, said he's received over a hundred phone calls from people trying to get early access to the initial doses.
""I'd say that 5 to 10 percent of those were willing to try to make some contribution to a charity to get themselves bumped up in line,"" according to Malkin.
Malkin's practice has also applied to become a vaccine distributor but is focusing on the newly FDA-authorized Moderna vaccine, which will be easier to handle because it doesn't have the same extreme temperature storage requirements as the Pfizer doses.
When it comes cutting in line, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has warned the state will be ""very aggressive in making sure that those with means, those with influence, are not crowding out those that are most deserving of the vaccines.""
""To those that think they can get ahead of the line, and those that think because they have resources, or they have relationships that will allow them to do it. We will be monitoring that very, very, closely,"" Newsom said this month.

http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/12/18/Pfizer-COVID-vaccines-Philippines-Duque.html,Duque: Pfizer deal does not secure 10 million doses for PH,CNN Philippines Staff,2020-12-18 15:15:15,"Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, December 18) — Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Friday dismissed allegations he caused the delay in the vaccine deal with US drugmaker Pfizer, adding the papers that took him 17 days to sign does not specifically assure 10 million doses for the Philippines by January.
He belied the specifications for supply and shipment mentioned by Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., who brokered the deal with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Philippine Ambassador to the US Babe Romualdez. Locsin said the 10 million doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine were supposed to arrive in Clark, Pampanga in January 2021, but someone bungled the deal. Senator Panfilo Lacson identified Duque as the suspect.
Duque said there have been meetings between Philippine officials and Pfizer executives where it was mentioned that US President Donald Trump asked the firm to allot supplies for the Philippines, but the health chief noted that discussions did not include the specific details bared by Locsin.
""I completely, unequivocally deny that. Unang-una, ang 10 million dose na iyan, wala naman akong alam. Wala silang pinadalang sulat na may ganoong commitment ang Pfizer. There was no document. As Secretary of Health, the right thing to do was send me a communication that the Pfizer is securing 10 million doses for the country,"" he told CNN Philippines.
Duque said the confidentiality disclosure agreement or CDA that reached his table was for Pfizer to share vaccine development data to the Philippines so talks on supply and shipment can begin.
""It's not a key to securing any quota or amount of vaccine from Pfizer,"" he stressed.
Bureaucratic red tape?
It took Duque 17 working days before he signed the CDA, a requirement for the two parties to begin advanced talks on vaccine procurement.

Pfizer submitted the draft agreement to the Philippines on August 11, which was meant to be signed by the Office of the Executive Secretary in behalf of the national government. The Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, and the Office of Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea held several meetings to ""align,"" Duque said. More than a month later, the health secretary said he was informed by Medialdea's office that the DOH will sign for the three agencies. Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said this was decided upon just so they can move forward with the deal.
From receiving the go-signal from OES on September 25, Duque said he signed the CDA on October 20. He added vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also signed it in November. Duque said he has all the documents to prove he did not delay the deal, adding the papers will be part of his report to President Rodrigo Duterte who has asked him to explain in public.

No 'kickvacc'
Duque also denied any hint of corruption surrounding the botched deal to buy the Pfizer vaccines, even as senators warned the DOH may face criminal charges for the delayed transaction. He dismissed the allegation of Senator Francis Pangilinan that some officials may have asked for 'kickvacc' (kickback) or commissions from the purchase deal.
""Unang-una, hindi pwede magkaroon ng corruption dito [First of all, there can't be any corruption here] because the President really abhors corruption. He will be the one to jail you himself if you are corrupt. He has already yanked out several of his Cabinet members,"" Duque said. ""Wala iyan, walang kickback 'yan [There's none, there's no kickback here].""

Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. on Friday said he and Philippine Ambassador to Washington Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez are back to square one in securing vaccine supply for the country.
""He and I are trying again. Not same order that went to Singapore; but another one even smaller,"" Locsin tweeted.
Romualdez said the deal will possibly involve only 5 million doses — only half of the initial plan.
Locsin on Tuesday tweeted that he and Romualdez were able to secure 10 million doses of Pfizer vaccine to arrive in the country by January 2021, but plans were foiled because ""someone dropped the ball.""
Romualdez said the vaccine arrival will most likely be delayed to June because other nations were able to finalize deals earlier than the Philippines, including Singapore.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/12/18/Moderna-US-FDA-COVID-vaccine-authorization.html,US FDA panel recommends Moderna's vaccine as country surpasses 17 million official COVID-19 cases,Christina Maxouris and Jason Hanna,2020-12-18 06:32:54,"(CNN) — As the United States on Thursday surpassed 17 million official Covid-19 cases, a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended a second coronavirus vaccine for the country.
The developments come as the US, after starting distribution of its first authorized vaccine this week, is dealing with record rates of daily cases, daily deaths and numbers of Covid-19 patients in hospitals.
The FDA is widely expected to grant emergency use authorization for Moderna's vaccine candidate -- as it did for Pfizer's vaccine last week -- after its vaccine advisory panel voted to recommend it.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would need to greenlight the vaccine before shots can be administered -- and a CDC advisory panel is expected to meet on the matter Saturday, raising the possibility that the Moderna vaccine could be used next week.
The recently authorized Pfizer vaccine, meanwhile, has been administered to hundreds of US health care workers this week, and drug store chains CVS and Walgreens are helping to get shots to long-term care residents and staff members.
But as vaccinations begin, recorded cases, hospitalizations and deaths are rising to levels not previously seen, as hospital staff around the country warn they're running out of space and energy to provide sufficient care:
• Average cases: The country's average number of daily cases across a week was 215,729 on Wednesday -- a record high, Johns Hopkins University data show. That's more than three times what the daily case average was during a summer peak in July.
ADVERTISEMENT
• Cases in one day: The US recorded 247,403 cases on Wednesday, a record for one day.
• Deaths: The nation averaged 2,569 deaths daily across the last week -- the highest average yet. The total reported Wednesday -- 3,656 -- is a one-day high.
• Hospitalizations: 113,090 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals Wednesday -- the most recorded on a given day, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
The White House coronavirus task force warned this week that although spread has slowed somewhat in the northern and central US, cases are still surging in more populated states.
And it lamented that state and local governments are ""not implementing the same mitigation policies that stemmed the tide of the summer surge,"" citing indoor gatherings at home and calling for a ""significant reduction in capacity or closure in public and private indoor spaces, including restaurants and bars.""
Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of Emory University's school of medicine, said he agreed.
""We're just simply saying, 'Well, we're getting vaccine.' But the vaccine is coming way too late for thousands of people who will die before we get the vaccine"" distributed widely,"" del Rio told CNN's New Day"" on Thursday.
""Transmissions (of the virus) are actively happening, and I think before the end of the year, we may be getting close to 4,000 deaths a day,"" del Rio said.
The country's total official case count stood at more than 17,149,231 on Thursday afternoon, according to JHU, only five days after the count surpassed 16 million and just hours after passing the 17 million mark. But researchers have said the actual number of US infections -- counting those that weren't tested for -- probably is many millions higher.
'We are still in for a very rough few weeks at least'
Health experts have said Americans have important choices to make: The upcoming holidays could help drive another surge of cases, hospitalizations and, inevitably, deaths, if people opt to travel and gather again.
Despite a warning from the CDC before Thanksgiving urging against travel, more than 4 million spent the holiday away from home.
In California, Los Angeles County has frequently broken records for new daily cases, hospitalizations and daily deaths in recent weeks. On Thursday, about 65% of the county's hospitals were on ""diversion,"" meaning they could no longer accept new patients and had to direct incoming ambulances to other facilities.
Health Director Barbara Ferrer attributed the surges to residents gathering over the Thanksgiving holiday, despite repeated pleas to stay home.
""This is a post-holiday surge that doesn't need to be,"" Ferrer told CNN. ""This is a lot of intermingling that needn't have happened.""
And the worst is yet to come, county health services director Dr. Christina Ghaly said earlier this week. ""We are still in for a very rough few weeks at least, and potentially through January,"" Ghaly said.
By late Thursday, four of five California regions will officially be under a state-mandated stay-at-home order, because intensive-care unit capacity in those regions fell below 15%.
Three regions fell under the order earlier this month, and it officially goes into effect in the fourth -- the entire San Fransciso Bay Area -- at 11:59 p.m. PT, after the ICU capacity fell below the threshold this week, state officials said.
Officials in much of the Bay Area preemptively ordered their residents to stay home earlier this month because the capacity was dropping. But this week's data puts the entire region under the state order, which now covers all of the state except a mostly rural region stretching from north of Sacramento to the Oregon state line.
Governors across the Northeast and Midwest, meanwhile, issued a video message this week encouraging residents to ""double down"" on safety measures and reconsider their holiday plans.
""If you are planning to travel or gather with other households for the holidays -- we urge you to reconsider,"" the governors said. ""Just one infection can cause an outbreak in your community, which could overwhelm our hospitals and put you and your loved ones at risk.""
In hopes of helping curb the spread around the holidays, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego announced curfews from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. lasting from December 23 to December 26 and from December 30 to January 4.
""What people need to know is, we are still at a dangerous and critical part of this pandemic, and tens of thousands of American lives are at stake,"" Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Wednesday.
""If you can avoid traveling, that's a good measure,"" he added.
It's OK to squeeze extra dozes of Pfizer vaccine from the vials, FDA says
As for the Pfizer vaccine, the FDA said people administering it may squeeze out extra doses from the vials if there is leftover solution in them after giving the standard five doses.
Politico was first to report that some pharmacists found they could get six -- and possibly even seven -- doses of vaccine out of vials, which are each designed to provide five doses. An FDA spokeswoman told CNN the agency was aware of the issue and ""working with Pfizer to determine the best path forward.""
""At this time, given the public health emergency, FDA is advising that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh) from each vial, pending resolution of the issue,"" the spokeswoman said. ""However, since the vials are preservative-free, it is critical to note that any further remaining product that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one.""
More than 2.9 million doses were allocated to states for the first Pfizer vaccine doses, according to a list published Wednesday by the CDC.
The Pfizer vaccine requires each patient to receive two doses about 21 days apart, and the Moderna vaccine also would require two doses. Assuming the Moderna vaccine is authorized, the two products could combine for an availability of 40 million doses, for 20 million people, by the end of December, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said.",CNN

""I don't want to get ahead of the line, but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take,"" Biden told reporters Wednesday in Wilmington, Delaware.
""When I do it, I'll do it publicly, so you can all witness my getting it done,"" the President-elect said.
People familiar with the plans say Biden is likely to get his shot next week. The delay has not been borne out of hesitation, aides say, but rather logistics of administering the shot in a public setting.
Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper earlier this month that he would be ""happy to"" receive a coronavirus vaccine once Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said it was safe, and that he would get the injection in a public setting to demonstrate his confidence in it. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris also said in the interview that she would get the vaccine.
Fauci said Tuesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he feels strongly that Biden and Harris should be vaccinated ""as soon as we possibly can.""
Three former presidents -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- have all said they would publicly get the coronavirus vaccine as a way to demonstrate its safety and efficacy.
ADVERTISEMENT
Trump administration officials have discussed how and when President Donald Trump might receive a coronavirus vaccine, but haven't yet made a final decision on scheduling his shot, a person familiar with the plan previously told CNN.
The first doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech coronavirus vaccine were injected into health care workers, those at the front lines of the pandemic, on Monday. The vaccine was authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use last week, and the first doses have been delivered to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities be first in line to get vaccinated. It will likely be months before the vaccine is widely available to the rest of the population.
The FDA is also considering an Emergency Use Authorization for Moderna's vaccine candidate this week.
Biden has said his administration would aim to distribute 100 million vaccine shots, which is enough to cover 50 million people, in his initial 100 days in office. Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses administered several weeks apart in order to reach 95% efficacy.
The President-elect has also pledged to sign a face mask mandate on his first day in office -- he will ask Americans to wear a face mask for his first 100 days -- and has said he is also prioritizing efforts to get kids back to school safely.",CNN

The case is the first allergic reaction to the vaccine to be reported in the US, although health officials said they are expecting the occasional allergic reaction -- and are prepared to treat anyone suffering from one.
""We expected that a side effect like this could occur after reports of anaphylaxis were made in England after people there received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine,"" said Alaska's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink. ""All sites that are approved to provide vaccinations in Alaska must have medications on hand to deal with an allergic reaction and that was the case in Juneau.""
The worker was among staff being vaccinated at Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau as part of the rollout of Pfizer's vaccine across the country Tuesday.
According to Dr. Lindy Jones, an attending physician at Bartlett Memorial Hospital, the worker was initially held in the vaccine monitoring area right after receiving the shot, and took a Benadryl. When she reported shortness of breath, she was taken to the emergency room.
When Jones saw her in the hospital, he said she was experiencing shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate, and had developed a rash covering her face and torso.
""I was concerned about an anaphylactic reaction so gave her the standard treatment of a dose of intramuscular epinephrine and she responded immediately,"" Jones told a news briefing. She was also given antihistamines.
ADVERTISEMENT
She still had an elevated heart rate and was breathing fast -- a sign of an allergic reaction -- so Jones gave her another dose of epinephrine, as well as steroids ""which is another standard bread and butter treatment for adverse anaphylactic reactions,"" he said.
Jones said the worker, who was not further identified to protect her privacy, had no previous history of allergies to vaccines. She is almost recovered after a night in the intensive care unit.
""She was still enthusiastic that she got the vaccine and the benefits it would give her in the future,"" Jones said.
""This was an instance where the system worked very well,"" Dr. Jay Butler of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the news briefing.
""This incident was reported last night to the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. The State of Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) has been in close communication with the CDC, and the agency is providing guidance and support,"" the state health department said in a statement.
Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said on Wednesday that doctors will have to keep an eye out for allergic reactions to the new vaccine.
""It's the kind of thing that we're obviously going to need to look at,"" Offit told CNN's Brianna Keilar.
He noted there were two reported cases of allergic reaction in Britain, which rolled out the vaccine earlier this month.
""There were obviously several people in the United Kingdom who had had a severe allergic reaction to this vaccine and had a history of severe allergic reaction,"" said Offit, who is director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
""Currently, the CDC recommendation is that if you ever had a severe allergic reaction to an injectable medical product, you shouldn't get this vaccine,"" Offit added.
""About one out of every million people that get a vaccine can have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. What we need to find out is what specifically seems to be inducing this allergic reaction.""
An FDA spokeswoman said the agency was working with Pfizer and the CDC to better understand what happened.
""Importantly, the fact sheets to healthcare providers include language that severe allergic reactions have been reported following vaccination and that appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available for administration of any individual in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs,"" the spokeswoman told CNN.

Lacson said the government would have secured the delivery of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine if not for Duque’s “indifference,” after he “failed to work on the necessary documentary requirement.”
“The country representative of Pfizer was even following up on the submission of such documentary requirement,” said Lacson in a statement.
Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. on Tuesday tweeted that he and Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez were able to secure millions of vaccine doses to arrive in the country by January 2021, but plans were foiled because ""someone dropped the ball."" Romualdez said the vaccine arrival will most likely be delayed by a few months because other nations were able to finalize deals earlier than the Philippines.
""Only pushed back to later date of delivery possibly June next year because we did (not) act quick enough on the CDA (Confidential Disclosure Agreement). Other countries got ahead of us like Singapore,"" Romualdez said in a text message to CNN Philippines.
Duque, however, refuted Locsin's claim.
ADVERTISEMENT
""There is no such thing as 'dropping of the ball.' The negotiations are ongoing,"" Duque said in a virtual media briefing.
Lacson, who talked to Locsin and Romualdez during a hearing of the Commission on Appointments, earlier hinted that a Cabinet official placed the vaccine deal in danger. He said this official made the Philippines miss the opportunity of receiving vaccines as early as January.
He added that the ""captain ball"" always messes up but stays in power because the ""coach refuses to replace him.""
“Secretary Duque’s reaction that negotiation with Pfizer is still ongoing after he branded as false Secretary Locsin’s statement that somebody dropped the ball is true but such negotiation, according to Ambassador Romualdez, is a renewed initiative after they missed the bus the first time,” said Lacson in a statement.
“The more important question is, how many lives would be saved between January and when (if at all) the vaccines may be made available again to Filipinos,” he added.
 Lacson has repeatedly called for the firing of Duque over alleged lapses on the country's COVID-19 response, but President Rodrigo Duterte has always vouched for the secretary.
Related: Lacson to Duterte: What ‘amulet, magic potion’ does Duque have for staying in office?
Moreover, Duque insisted that he has completed his office's role in finalizing the confidentiality disclosure agreement for vaccine purchase. He said his office was advised on September 24 to review the deal and that he signed it on October 20. The health chief said he meticulously reviewed the papers — even seeking help from legal experts — for possible onerous provisions in the agreement.
""I wanted to make sure na hindi onerous o disadvantageous to government iyong mga provisions,"" he said. ""On Oct 20, on the day that this was given to me, submitted to me, I signed it already. So there is no such thing as somebody dropping the ball. It is really an ongoing (negotiation).""
[Translation: I wanted to make sure the provisions are not onerous or disadvantageous to the government.]
Meanwhile, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also vouched for the health secretary, echoing the latter’s statement that negotiations are underway.
“There is no bungled deal, because ongoing po ang negotiation,” Galvez told CNN Philippines on Thursday, adding that there was only a delay at most in the process.
Galvez also said the claim that the Philippines could have immediately secured 10 million doses is “impossible,” as Pfizer has only recently been granted emergency use authorization. He further noted that the richest countries have already bought some 80 percent of the Pfizer vaccine.
“Wala po 'yung sinasabi nilang dropping the ball,"" he said. ""Hindi po nangyari ito kasi nasalo po natin eh. Dahil kasi po ang nakita po natin ay talagang nag-iingat po tayo sa mga pinipirmahan po natin.”
[Translation: There was no such thing as dropping the ball. This did not happen, and in fact, we caught the ball. We are being careful in the documents we are signing.]
To date, only the vaccine produced by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech has secured emergency use authorization abroad, including from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Singapore.
The Duterte administration is still banking on Chinese-manufactured vaccine Sinovac to be the first vaccine to reach the Philippines. Roque on Tuesday said Sinovac is the only brand that can provide supply at the earliest time possible, which is in March or April 2021. The government is looking to secure up to 25 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine, even if the Chinese drug maker has not yet disclosed results of its phase 3 clinical trials to prove it is safe and effective.
The country has so far formally secured 2.6 million doses of vaccine from British drug maker AstraZeneca, which are expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021.The deal was closed through a ₱600-million donation from over 30 private companies. The company has also agreed to provide another batch of vaccines, officials said.",CNN

Quidangen is the first person to be vaccinated in the Canadian province of Ontario, as the country began rolling out an initial 30,000 doses.
In a Facebook post, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Quidangen and all frontline workers for their sacrifices amid the pandemic.
A video he shared also showed those present during the monumental vaccination broke into applause after Quidangen received her shot.
""These vaccinations mark a big step forward in our fight against this virus,"" Trudeau wrote. ""But they don't mean we're out of the woods,"" he added, urging citizens to remain vigilant and continue following health protocols.

It also announced it would spend about $400 million more to help developing countries access testing, therapeutics and vaccines. Federal officials said they have so far contributed more than $800 million in the global effort to help developing countries cope with COVID-19.
The country has logged over 472,000 confirmed cases, placing just one notch above the Philippines in the global list, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Of the total infected in Canada, 13,570 died while 385,021 were able to recover.",CNN

""The transition is complicating, but the new administration is willing to rely on actual experts and not attack those experts,"" Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union.""
President Donald Trump has refused to concede the 2020 election to Biden and has not coordinated with the President-elect on the Covid-19 vaccine candidates and the massively complex distribution operation. Biden has said that the Trump administration had shared information -- but not a ""detailed plan"" -- with his transition team about the nationwide distribution of a vaccine.
In his interview with Tapper, Gates praised Biden's incoming administration for ""laying out clear plans"" to slow the spread of Covid-19, adding that ""I think we'll get through this in a positive way.""
""You know I'm pleased with the people and the priority that President-elect Biden and his team are bringing to bear on this problem,"" he said.
The Gates Foundation on Thursday said it plans to commit an additional $250 million to support the ""research, development and equitable delivery"" of tools to fight Covid-19, including tests, treatments and vaccines. The announcement brings the group's total commitments to the global Covid-19 response to $1.75 billion.
Gates lauded Biden for ""doing his best to retain"" Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who Gates said would be ""willing to admit when things aren't going well"" and ""deliver tough messages.""
""I do think the US will not be one of the worst performers, as the (Biden) team comes into office,"" he added.
The United States is the nation with the most cases and deaths from Covid-19. As of Sunday morning, the US had reported more than 16 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 300,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Gates noted in his interview that the US ""would've been expected to be the best"" when it came to the pandemic given its federal health agencies and various technologies, but ""sadly ... we didn't get on top of it like many countries did,"" adding that future post-mortems on the crisis ""will guide us.""
Biden has laid out a three-point plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including aiming to distribute 100 million vaccine shots in his initial 100 days in office. Biden also told Tapper in an interview earlier this month, that he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office.
During his interview with Tapper, Gates confirmed that he has spoke with Biden about the pandemic.
The price to pay each year ""to avoid, you know, a trillions of dollars disaster -- I think that roadmap's clear, and I talked with the President-elect about that. And you know, I think our foundation will be part of that dialogue to make sure we don't blow it again,"" Gates said.
The US is close to a vaccine as the Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued an emergency use authorizaton for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine. And the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted on Saturday to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for people ages 16 and older, moving the US another step closer to being able to inoculate millions of its citizens.
Gates told Tapper that distribution ""should be based on medical need, not wealth at all.""
""After all, this epidemic has been awful in the way that it's exacerbated inequities,"" he said.
Gates also said he is ""super happy with all of these vaccines"" and that when it's his turn for vaccination, ""I will visibly take the vaccine. Because I think that it's a benefit to all people to not be transmitting.""

The inoculation, which had yet to progress beyond Phase 1 trials, was being jointly developed by the University of Queensland and Australian biotech company CSL. Australia had hoped the vaccine would be available by mid-2021.
In a statement, CSL said that no serious adverse effects had been reported in the 216 trial participants, and the vaccine was shown to have a ""strong safety profile."" However trial data revealed that antibodies generated by the vaccine interfered with HIV diagnosis and led to false positives on some HIV tests, CSL said.
If the vaccine was rolled out nationally, CSL said it could undermine public health in Australia by causing a wave of false positive HIV tests in the community.
""Follow up tests confirmed that there is no HIV virus present, just a false positive on certain HIV tests. There is no possibility the vaccine causes infection,"" the statement added.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday morning that the vaccine ""will no longer feature as part of the country's vaccine plan."" Australia had pre-emptively ordered 51 million doses of the CSL vaccine in October.
Morrison said that Australia had backed four vaccines that showed promise but ""at no stage ... believed that all four of those vaccines would likely get through that process.""

""So that's why we spread our risk. That's why we backed important projects. And that's why we pre-prepared to ensure that we could deal with any issues along the way,"" he said.
In addition to the University of Queensland vaccine, Australia had previously ordered a combined 73.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca and the Novavax vaccines.
Australian Minister for Health Greg Hunt said that following the announcement, Australia would be ordering an extra 20 million units from AstraZeneca and 11 million from Novovax.
A vaccine has to pass through three stages of trials before it can then be considered for approval for public use. Australia has yet to grant approval to a coronavirus vaccine candidate.
Adam Taylor, early career research leader in emerging viruses at Griffith University's Menzies Health Institute, said in an emailed statement that the false positive HIV results were a result of the technology used to create the vaccine.
""The (vaccine's) molecular clamp is made from a HIV protein, which on its own is harmless. The molecular clamp stabilizes the coronavirus spike protein and presents it to the body in a way that promotes a good immune response. This is why the clamp technology is so vital,"" Taylor said.
He added that the clamp model vaccine had shown ""good safety and immune response"" against the coronavirus in early clinical trials, and the possibility for generating an HIV positive result had been thought to be low.
Some Australian health experts have praised the University of Queensland researchers for ending the trial when they did. ""Although it might seem counter-intuitive, from a research ethics viewpoint, this is a success,"" said Diego Silva, an health ethics expert at the University of Sydney School of Public Health, in an emailed statement.",CNN

Seventeen members voted yes, four voted no and one abstained.
This vote doesn't mean the vaccine will be authorized immediately.
The FDA will now decide whether to accept the recommendation but has signaled that it will issue the EUA for the vaccine.
Then, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices must meet to decide whether it recommends that the vaccine be deployed for use. ACIP has a meeting scheduled for Friday, and expects to vote during another meeting, scheduled for Sunday.
Operation Warp Speed officials say they will start shipping the vaccine within 24 hours of FDA authorization.
The VRPBAC is also scheduled to meet again next week to discuss Moderna's EUA application.

During a Senate session on Wednesday, budget sponsor Senator Sonny Angara was hounded by repeated questions on the estimated number of vaccine recipients for 2021.
""Hindi pa po maliwanag [It is still unclear],"" he responded.
The Senate finance committee chairman said the bicameral conference committee, which also approved the House and Senate versions of the 2021 budget on the same day, were not told of the government's detailed plans for coronavirus vaccination.
""I guess what is important is we have provided the appropriation cover for the government....and we've given them the power to act, although we're not quite sure how they will utilize these funds,"" Angara admitted.
The senator, however, did present estimates based on the market prices of the different vaccines touted worldwide. For example, the United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca vaccine that is valued at ₱610 pesos has an estimated number of recipients in the country of over 135 million people, with two doses each.
The actual number, as well as the logistical expenses, would still depend on which vaccine brands the government chooses to buy, Angara said. So far, officials have shared that AstraZeneca and China-based Sinovac are nearing trials in the Philippines.

""I think I heard from our vaccine czar Charlie Galvez that the initial doses will come from AstraZeneca...but I also heard about negotiations with other pharmaceuticals,"" said Angara. ""But...I don't have personal knowledge of these negotiations.""
Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto lamented that Congress was not privy to the government's vaccination plans during the bicam deliberations.
""I was hoping the Executive during the bicam would talk to both chairs,"" said Recto. ""I was thinking they would be making a request more so today that we see rollout has begun and you need to make advanced payments for these vaccines. May pila 'yan [There is a queue].""
Health Department budget sponsor Senator Pia Cayetano also said she received information that the vaccine budget may only be able to cover about 25% of the population, far from the needed 60% to achieve herd immunity.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon and Senator Richard Gordon said they also would have wanted to see a vaccine roadmap, which Galvez said last month was already up for the President's approval.
""Our health system unfortunately at this stage is a big question mark to me because of the very fluid plans for the acquisition, funding of the vaccine and the logistical expense that goes with it,"" Drilon said. ""But I guess we just have to look at the sky and pray.""",CNN

""We will start to have shots in arms within 96 hours of EUA,"" Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday. ""That's what I believe with all my heart.""
Pfizer and Moderna both have vaccine candidates awaiting EUAs, and the US Food and Drug Administration has confirmed Pfizer's safety and efficacy ahead of a Thursday approval meeting. The anticipated approval comes as the US suffers spikes in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths.
The US has averaged 206,152 new cases a day over the last seven days -- the highest number of cases in the pandemic so far. And Tuesday, 104,600 people were hospitalized with the virus, according to The COVID Tracking Project, a record that has been set and broken over and over in recent weeks. In total, 286,232 people have died of the virus and more than 15.1 million people have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The wider public will likely have to continue to grapple with spikes from the holiday season until vaccines are widely available in 2021. But officials are racing to distribute vaccines in the coming days for priority populations -- the elderly and health care workers.
While it will be a ""herculean task,"" Perna said that he is confident that, with the planning from the CDC and collaboration from partners, ""we will be able to execute this vaccine very efficiently, but more importantly, effectively.""
States prepare for vaccine distribution amid 'tragic milestones'
The impacts of the pandemic are spread across the country, Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services Admiral Brett Giroir told CNN Tuesday.

Los Angeles County confirmed a total of 8,000 coronavirus deaths and over 3,000 hospitalizations on Tuesday, which the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health called a ""tragic milestone"" in a news release. And Pennsylvania recorded its highest number of coronavirus hospitalizations Tuesday.
As local leaders manage rising cases, many are also getting their vaccine plans in order.
In Illinois, though the first delivery is expected next week, it will take months to roll out a vaccine, even to priority groups, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) said during a news conference Tuesday.
Delaware also anticipates receiving its first shipment next week. Dr. Karyl Rattay, with Delaware's Division of Public Health, announced Tuesday that the state is expecting nearly 9,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine around December 15 and more than 8,000 of Moderna's the following week.
Once Minnesota gets its first shipment of vaccines expected next week, they will be sent directly to key hospitals or ""hubs"" and then be delivered to smaller clinics, Gov. Tim Walz said during a news briefing.
Minnesota, Illinois, Mississippi and Delaware have said health care workers and long-term care residents will be the first to receive vaccinations.
'Vaccines that are not used are useless'
But for vaccines to be effective, the public has to use them -- and officials are urging participation in inoculations.
""Vaccines that are not used are useless,"" Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday. ""Vaccination is what's important.""
Their development has been fast, but experts say that doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective or unsafe.
Slaoui said that the speed came from taking operational and financial risks to develop the vaccine, not cutting scientific corners.
""The first thing is to point out that the speed has nothing to do with compromising safety or scientific integrity,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said. ""It's due to the extraordinary and exquisite advances in vaccine platform technology which has allowed us to do things in weeks to months that formerly took years, several years.
There is concern that many Americans will be skeptical about getting vaccines, but Fauci acknowledged a ""painful disparity"" in the prevalence of the virus among African Americans as well as a ""reluctance and skepticism about getting vaccinated.""
""I will tell you that I myself will be perfectly comfortable in taking the vaccine and I would recommend it to my family,"" he said.
US needs to pull together for holiday season
As more holidays approach, it is increasingly imperative that Americans acknowledge the realities of the pandemic and pull together to mitigate its impacts, experts said.
""The end of the pandemic is in sight. The vaccine will work, it will end the pandemic and return us to as near normal or normal as possible, but we have to do our part right now, which is those mitigations techniques,"" Giroir said.
The US was recording 40,000 to 70,000 new coronavirus cases daily before Thanksgiving, and the addition of holiday spread has resulted in a surge on top of a surge, Fauci said.
And families and friends gathering for Christmas and Hanukkah could add another spike to the mix, making impacts of the pandemic even worse in December and January, he said.
""We're going to be asking people to do something that is difficult and maybe even painful, particularly at the family level, is to tell people, unless it's absolutely necessary, not to travel,"" he said. ""We said that over Thanksgiving and we're saying the same thing over Christmas.""

The precautionary advice was given after the pair ""responded adversely"" following their shots on the first day of the mass vaccination rollout in the UK, NHS England said Wednesday.
According to PA Media, it is understood that both staff members had a significant history of allergic reactions and carried adrenaline autoinjectors. Thousands overall are believed to have been vaccinated in the UK on Tuesday.
""As is common with new vaccines the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday,"" said Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, in a statement. ""Both are recovering well.""
""Any person with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food (such as previous history of anaphylactoid reaction or those who have been advised to carry an adrenaline autoinjector) should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,"" states the new MHRA advice, reported PA Media. It said that vaccines ""should only be carried out in facilities where resuscitation measures are available.""
Vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit told CNN that allergic reactions to vaccines were not uncommon: ""Certainly, vaccines can cause severe allergic reactions. In the United States, roughly one of every 1.4 million doses of vaccines is complicated by a severe allergic reaction.""
He said that rather than a ""blanket recommendation"" for people with allergies, ""the smarter thing to do would be to try and look at these two patients and see what specific component of the vaccine they were allergic to.""
He said people should realize that there are immediate treatments for allergic reaction. ""That's why you're hanging out in the doctor's office,"" he said, before warning that the reports of allergic reactions ""will only serve as yet another way to scare people.""
Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that the authorization and approval process for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine ""has been incredibly robust."" The head of Britain's medicines regulator also put out assurances on Sunday, saying the Pfizer/BioNTech shot was ""as safe as any general vaccine.""
US drug giant Pfizer and German company BioNTech have said there are ""no serious safety concerns"" over the vaccine.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention typically advises telling a provider if you have ""any severe, life-threatening allergies"" before taking any vaccine.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/12/8/UK-first-COVID-vaccine-Pfizer-Biontech.html,"First Britons receive COVID-19 vaccine, a landmark moment in the pandemic",Ivana Kottasová,2020-12-08 15:38:47,"(CNN)— The United Kingdom has become the first Western nation to begin vaccinating its citizens with a COVID-19 shot outside of clinical trials — a landmark moment in the coronavirus pandemic.
The first Briton to get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine — 90-year-old Margaret Keenan — received the first of two doses at 6:31 a.m. local time on Tuesday at University Hospital in Coventry, less than a week after the UK became the first country to approve it.
Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said she felt ""privileged"" to be first to get the shot. ""It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year,"" she said, according to a statement released by the UK's National Health Service (NHS).
The logistical challenges of manufacturing and distributing tens of millions of vaccines mean the roll out will be gradual, with the most vulnerable people and health care workers first in line.
May Parsons, the nurse who administered the historic jab, said she was honored to be involved in the program. ""The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.
The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, but only 800,000 shots will be available as part of the first wave that began on Tuesday.
Because the vaccine requires two doses administered at least three weeks apart, the UK will have enough shots to vaccinate roughly a third of the country's population. The country has also ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which could be approved for emergency use in the UK within the next few weeks.
ADVERTISEMENT
There will be 50 vaccination hubs in hospitals across England and dozens more across Wales and Scotland. In England, the vaccinations will only be administered by hospitals. Wales and Scotland have yet to specify the types of locations they plan to have administer the vaccine.
Keenan will have to go back for the second dose in three or four weeks' time. According to the government's guidance, each vaccinated person will receive a credit card-sized vaccination document with details of their next appointment. Seven to 10 days after the second dose, she should be protected against the virus.
While the UK's immunization program started with a big bang on Tuesday, the vaccine remains off limits to the vast majority of people.
For now, it is available by invitation only for those age 80 and over, care homes staff and frontline health and social care workers. Care home residents were also expected to be prioritized, but the government said last week this won't happen immediately.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at minus 75 degrees Celsius (minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit), which makes its distribution difficult. Moderna's vaccine, if approved, could be a more practical option for the care homes, as it can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit).
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offers 95% protection against Covid-19. According to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), more than one in 10 recipients may suffer side effects including pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. A handful of other, less common, side effects are also listed.
The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to follow the UK's MHRA and authorize the emergency use for the Pfizer vaccine as soon as this week — its vaccine advisory committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday.
The European Medicines Agency will conclude its decision on the vaccine on December 29, according to the European Commission.

Vaccinations are set to begin on Tuesday in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland said it would start administering the vaccine early in the week but did not specify which day.
The process, which is complicated by the need to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine under strict conditions and give each recipient two doses, three weeks apart, will be closely watched from around the world.
Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that 50 hospital hubs across England had already received their allocation of the vaccine, and that the distribution of the vaccine was ""really well underway now.""
UK health officials expect to have up to 4 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, available by the end of December, Cordery said.
The government has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine so far, enough to vaccinate 20 million people, or a third of the UK population. More deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded in the UK than anywhere else in Europe.
The speed with which UK regulators approved the vaccine -- ahead of their counterparts elsewhere in Europe and in the United States -- raised questions in some quarters. But Cordery said the process had been ""incredibly robust.""

""Yes, it has been shorter than other vaccine approval processes, but that's because everything all has been thrown at this all in one go,"" she said.
The head of the UK medicines regulator also put out assurances on Sunday, saying the Pfizer/BioNTech jab is ""as safe as any general vaccine"" and that those receiving it would be monitored by health officials.
""You might have a mild symptom but it will probably disappear in a day or two, and nothing at all of a serious nature,"" June Raine, head of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), told the BBC.
According to the MHRA, more than one in 10 recipients may suffer side effects including pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. A handful of other, less common, side effects are also listed.
Asked about the potential impact of Brexit on the vaccination program, Raine said: ""We've practiced, we are ready and we are fully prepared for any possible outcome.""
The transition period for the UK's exit from the European Union comes to an end on December 31. Last-ditch talks between EU and UK leaders on a trade deal continued over the weekend, amid dire warnings over the economic and logistic chaos that would result from a hard crash out of the world's largest trading bloc.
""Our goal at the HMRA is to make sure that whatever the outcome, whatever the deal, medicines, medical devices, and vaccines reach everyone in all parts of the country in the same way without any interruption at all,"" Raine said.
Logistical challenge
The first doses of the vaccine reportedly arrived in the UK on Thursday night, carried by a fleet of unmarked trucks through the Eurotunnel from Belgium to undisclosed storage facilities in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, according to CNN affiliate ITV News.
The UK government's announcement of its approval a day earlier had been followed by confusion over who would get the vaccine first and how it could be administered safely, given the logistical constraints.
The vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, a temperature only possible in special freezers. Once taken out of the freezer, the MHRA authorization requires the doses to be kept refrigerated and used within 5 days. Batches can only be moved and repacked into smaller numbers of doses a limited number of times and under strict conditions. Once a vial is diluted for injection, it cannot be transported and must be used within six hours, or discarded.
The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended vaccinating residents of care homes for older adults and their staff first, followed by people aged over 80 as well as health and care workers.
But the challenges involved in getting the vaccine to care home residents means health workers now plan to administer it first to people aged over 80 who are about to be discharged from hospital, or are attending out-patient hospital appointments.
""Hospitals will also begin inviting over 80s in for a jab and work with care home providers to book their staff in to vaccination clinics,"" a statement from NHS England said Sunday. ""Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from Covid.""
Raine told the BBC the exact timing might be ""variable"" but that she expected to see the vaccine reach care homes ""definitely within the next two weeks.""
Northern Ireland's Health Ministry said Friday an initial consignment of almost 25,000 doses had arrived, paving the way for ""vaccinations to commence from early next week, starting with vaccinator teams.""
Scotland is set to receive 65,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from the initial batch of 800,000 doses distributed in the UK, Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack said in an op-ed for the Mail on Sunday.
He added that the Armed Forces were involved in the planning and logistics of the vaccination program.
Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said those giving the vaccinations would be the first to receive it, followed by care home residents and staff, then all those 80 years of age and over and front line health and social care workers.
She acknowledged the challenges around transporting the vaccine to care homes and individual residences, but added: ""For all the difficulties that lie ahead, it should give us all real hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight.""
Fauci apology
Other nations are not far behind the UK when it comes to taking a decision on approving the vaccine.
The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee December 10 to discuss Pfizer/BioNTech's emergency authorization application. It will meet again on December 17 to consider the application for Moderna's vaccine candidate.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, apologized Thursday after suggesting a day earlier that UK regulators had not scrutinized the data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as carefully as their US counterparts.
News of the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was welcomed by many Britons as a ray of light at the end of a dark year.
There are hopes that UK approval could soon follow for Moderna and the vaccine candidate developed by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
But the four chief medical officers for the United Kingdom warned in a letter that this winter would still be ""especially hard"" and that people must not let down their guard against the virus.
""Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months,"" they said.
Russia starts mass vaccination
Meanwhile, vaccination centers across Moscow started to distribute Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, initially to groups such as teachers, health professionals, and municipal services workers.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered large-scale vaccination with Sputnik V to begin across the country from this week.
Russia became the first country in the world to approve its coronavirus vaccine in August, authorizing the treatment for public use even before crucial Phase 3 trials -- which are still underway -- were conducted. The move drew criticism from scientific circles.
""Civil vaccination has started at 70 points in Moscow today. We work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week,"" Natalya Nikolaevna Kuzenkova, chief doctor of Moscow's Hospital 68, told CNN on Saturday.
Kuzenkova shrugged off questions about vaccine safety. ""If there is a question between getting sick or getting a vaccine ... this is a very dangerous disease which leads to quite serious consequences. So the answer is obvious here,"" she said.
""The vaccine has officially been registered. Two stages of clinical trials have passed and we are now completing the third stage. Therefore, within the framework of a pandemic, in these conditions, this does not at all contradict any regulatory norms,"" she added.
Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin suggested early participation was enthusiastic, saying more than 5,000 people had registered for vaccination in the first five hours.
One of those getting vaccinated Saturday told CNN she was ""not at this point"" afraid of having the vaccine before trials are over.
""Well, of course there are some concerns. But I try not to think about it,"" said the woman, who works as an administrator at the hospital and identified herself only as Nadezhda. ""I wanted to get immunity from the new Covid-19 infection. Protect myself and my family. In order not to get sick, not to get complications, not to infect my loved ones.""
Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said last week that more than 100,000 Russian citizens had already had the Sputnik V vaccine.
Officials say there are enough doses for more than 2 million people across Russia, which has a population of about 145 million.

""Sure, I will have myself vaccinated once the Vaccine Expert Panel of the DOST and FDA's regulatory and technical evaluation determine the safety quality and effectiveness of the vaccines,"" Duque said.

On her Sunday radio show, Vice President Leni Robredo said she would agree to be one of the first in line for the vaccine, but believes officials should be willing to take the challenge with the proper intention.
""Depende sa dahilan. Kung ang dahilan magpapakita ay ma-encourage iyong confidence sa kaligtasan ng bakuna, tama iyon,"" Robredo said. ""Pero hindi siya tama kung ang dahilan, gusto niya siya lagi ang unang maprotektahan kasi ang dapat maunang protektahan 'yung pinaka-exposed, at nagsang-ayon ako na health care workers iyon.""

The government has already listed health care workers as the first group that will be inoculated with the COVID-19 vaccine. Robredo also previously suggested that the first recipients should be specifically named to avoid delays and other hurdles.
She also encouraged the public to be on the lookout for misinformation and ""irresponsible noise-making"" against COVID-19 vaccination, to avoid a repeat of ""fake news"" that once led to the Dengvaxia scare and vaccine hesitancy among Filipinos.

Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of the DOST-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, told CNN Philippines’ News Night on Wednesday that AstraZeneca’s application has been forwarded to the Food and Drug Administration for regulatory approval.
This came after it passed separate evaluations by a panel of vaccine experts and by the ethics review board, which is also composed of vaccine experts, technical experts, and scientists tasked to recommend possible vaccine candidates for the Philippines.
The FDA, meanwhile, has the final say on which firms will be allowed to conduct clinical trials in the country.

Shortly after Montoya made the disclosure, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said he has yet to receive the endorsement from DOST.
AstraZeneca is currently applying to hold Phase 3 of the clinical trials in the country, wherein a vaccine is tested on larger populations in different countries to confirm its efficacy and safety.
The national government, along with the private sector, inked a deal with the UK company last Nov. 27 for 2.6 million doses of the vaccine. This is expected to be rolled out in the Philippines by June 2021 if it passed clinical trials.

According to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., AstraZeneca is offering its vaccine at $10 or almost ₱500 per dose, making it the easiest and cheapest purchase among vaccine candidates. Meanwhile, the downpayment for every dose is only $5 or nearly ₱250.
However, Galvez also previously admitted the risks in signing the agreement amid doubts on AstraZeneca's efficacy. The drugmaker itself had confirmed that its clinical trials were put on hold twice due to concerns about two study participants who became seriously ill.
The country's COVID-19 task force is looking to administer vaccines from different manufacturers to at least 70 million Filipinos. The vaccination program will be carried out for three to five years with 25-30 million Filipinos vaccinated each year.
President Rodrigo Duterte has, meanwhile, signed an order granting FDA the power to issue emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. This directive allows a vaccine to be approved for use within one month instead of undergoing the usual six-month review.",CNN
http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/11/27/AstraZeneca-COVID-vaccine-trial-findings-transparency-data.html,AstraZeneca hopes the world can focus on its positive vaccine news. But experts fear a lack of transparency has clouded that,Kara Fox,2020-11-27 02:25:32,"(CNN) — When the British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca announced on Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine is 70% effective on average, the world exhaled a collective sigh of relief and stocks rallied. Another vaccine with promising results had arrived.
But a lack of clarity surrounding several aspects of the data from the AstraZeneca vaccine trials have raised some eyebrows in the scientific community, potentially setting back the timing for the vaccine to be authorized in Europe and the US.
AstraZeneca said on Monday that study participants in the UK had been given two different courses of the vaccine.
The drugmaker, which developed the vaccine with the University of Oxford, did not however, at the time, explain why they used two different dosing regimens or why the size of one group was significantly smaller than the other.
In one group, 2,741 participants received a half-dose of the vaccine and then a full dose at least a month later. This group was 90% protected against COVID-19.
In the second group, 8,895 participants received a full dose followed by another full dose at least a month later. This group was only 62% protected.
That's why AstraZeneca says their vaccine is 70% effective, on average.

But some scientists are questioning why the company would report on a pooled result of two different trials, as it deviates from standard reporting on clinical trials.
And in the days following that announcement, another point of confusion has emerged.
On Tuesday, Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President who heads up non-oncology research and development, first explained to Reuters that a lab error was the reason why some volunteers had received a smaller dose -- the dose that proved to be 90% effective. ""The reason we had the half dose is serendipity,"" Pangalos said, adding that researchers had ""underpredicted the dose of the vaccine by half.""
In a statement on Wednesday, Oxford's communications manager for vaccines told CNN that ""dose selection for any new vaccine is a complicated area, and in exploring methods of dose selection, we discovered one gave a lower dose than expected.""
Oxford elaborated further on Thursday, saying in a statement to CNN that a ""difference in the manufacturing process"" had led to the error.
That manufacturing problem has since been corrected, the statement said, noting that the UK regulator overseeing the trial had agreed to include ""both approaches"" in Phase 3.
While AstraZeneca and Oxford face criticism about transparency -- given that they did not mention the error in their press release announcing the results nor on a press call on Monday -- the company believes the world should focus on the trial's positive results.
Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Menelas Pangalos AstraZeneca's Executive Vice-President said, ""The mistake is actually irrelevant.
""Whichever way you cut the data -- even if you only believe the full-dose, full-dose data... We still have efficacy that meets the thresholds for approval with a vaccine that's over 60% effective,"" Pangalos said, according to the WSJ.
AstraZeneca and Oxford have yet to put forward a candidate for interview, as requested by CNN.
The US Food and Drug Administration requires a threshold of at least 50% efficacy. It is not clear if the FDA will authorize emergency use however.
AstraZeneca has not yet tested its half-strength dose in the US either. But on Thursday, a spokesperson for the company told CNN their aim was to include the half-strength dose regimen into their US trials, which currently has around 10,000 participants.
The spokesperson said that the company hopes to recruit around 40,000 volunteers in total -- some of whom would receive the half-dose vaccine. They added that they were in ""ongoing discussions"" with the FDA for approval, adding that nothing formal had been announced.
On Monday, Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee -- which will review COVID-19 vaccines before they are put on the market -- said the lack of data that led them to their conclusions made it ""hard to know the significance of their findings.""
When two other major drugmakers, Pfizer and Moderna, released their efficacy results earlier this month, they did include the data that led to their results.
AstraZeneca presented an analysis of 23,000 participants in its Phase 3 trial.
It said some participants received the COVID-19 vaccine, while others received a different vaccine for an unrelated virus, or placebo injections.
A total of 131 study participants developed COVID-19, AstraZeneca said, but they did not say how many of those people had received the vaccine.
What also remains unclear is why the two-dose regimes produced such different efficacy measures.
The trial's lead investigator at Oxford, Professor Andrew Pollard told journalists on Monday that's likely to do with the delicate balance of dosing someone just enough to trigger an immune response against the disease.
""What we've always tried to do with a vaccine is fool the immune system into thinking that there's a dangerous infection there that it needs to respond to -- but doing it in a very safe way,"" Pollard explained.
So, it may be that the best way of ""kicking the immune system into action"" could be to give the body a small amount of the vaccine to begin with -- and then follow up with a larger amount, he said.
Responding to whether he had genuine confidence that the half-dose group's 90% success was not just a feature of a small sample size, Pollard said that result was ""highly significant...even with the numbers that we have.""
But experts are questioning whether those results will hold up if more people are given the lower-dose regime.
In a call with reporters on Wednesday, the US vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui said they were reviewing AstraZeneca's vaccine data.
He said that group that got the mistakenly lower dose that yielded the 90% efficacy had been a younger group, with no one older than 55. That could potentially affect the strength of AstraZeneca's findings, given that young people typically produce stronger immune responses to vaccines.
Both Oxford and AstraZeneca told CNN on Thursday they were unable to give a breakdown of the ages of the people who were given the vaccine in that smaller group.
An AstraZeneca spokesperson told CNN on Thursday that, ""given the high efficacy we have now seen with the different dosing regimens, there is strong merit in continuing to further investigate these findings in order to establish the most effective dosing regimen for the vaccine.""
He added that the company is having discussions with regulators around the world to evaluate the findings and that they are looking forward to the publication of peer-reviewed results.
But Dr. Saad Omer, a vaccine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine believes the group with the 90% efficacy rate is relatively small and the results may not stand up when more people are given this regimen.
""I hate to criticize fellow academics, or anyone for that matter,"" he said, ""but releasing information like this is like asking us to try and read the tea leaves.""
On Wednesday, AstraZeneca's stock fell more than 6%.

""Kinuwento ni Martin (Romualdez) na sila ni Ping (Lacson) nagpa-test na kaagad. Nagpa-injection ng immunization. Sinubukan, parang ganoon,"" Sotto said.
[Translation: Martin said he and Ping got tested immediately. They got immunization shots. They tried it, it seemed.]
Sotto said Romualdez did not offer details, but the senator is convinced that he wasn't joking, adding that even the President got curious about getting immunized.
""Si Martin Romualdez nagkwento kay President. Nandoon ako, then President Duterte asked me. Ako nasa kanan niya. Sabi niya sa akin, 'O ano, tayong dalawa, testing na tayo,' Sabi niya sa akin.

I said, ""Sir, let's wait for them and the others to get tested first. Let's see what the results are. One of these days, Ping might ask me, 'Who you?'""]
Sotto said even Senator Bong Go expressed interest in getting vaccinated against COVID-19.

""Sabi ni President, 'Sige. 'Yan si Bong!' Si (Senator) Bong Go gusto rin. 'Sama ko,' sabi niya. Pero wala, di natuloy. Parang napagkwentuhan lang,"" Sotto explained.
[Translation: The President said, ""Okay. There's Bong!"" Bong Go wanted it as well. He said, ""Me, too!"" But nothing happened. Like it was just all talk.]
Asked about the conversation, Go said he is still waiting for the FDA-approved vaccine.
""Nagtanong lang kami sa kanila. Biruan lang. Pero inaantay muna namin ang FDA. Dapat safe para sa lahat,"" Go said.
[Translation: We just asked them about it. We were kidding around. But we are waiting for the FDA. Everything has to be safe.]
CNN Philippines tried to reach out to both Romualdez and Lacson, but both have yet to respond.
For Sotto, getting vaccinated is a personal choice and there's no violation even if the vaccine has not yet been approved by the country's FDA.
""To each his own. Marami mga gamot. Maraming vitamins, maraming gamot, maraming enhancers, nandiyan nakakalat. Sinasabi ng DOH at FDA huwag gagamitin pero ginagamit ng kababayan natin iba. To each his own,"" Sotto said.
[Translation: To each his own. There are lots of medicines. There are plenty of vitamins, medicines, and enhancers available. The DOH and the FDA say not to use, but some do. To each his own.]
Sotto then questioned why some vaccines and medicines already approved by foreign FDAs still need to be approved by their Philippine counterpart.
""Ang pinagtataka namin during the hearing, bakit FDA approved sa America, FDA approved sa Europe, FDA approved sa Asia, pagdating sa Pilipinas, yung FDA natin ayaw i-approve muna. Nagtatagal sa kanila. Tinatanong namin bakit. We did not get a clear answer,"" Sotto explained.
[Translation: What we were wondering about during the hearing was why it's taking time for our FDA to approve medicines already approved by FDAs in America, Europe, and Asia. It takes them a while. We asked. We did not get a clear answer.]
He noted that FDA approval here in the country sometimes could take years.
On Monday, the DOH cautioned Filipinos from getting inoculated with vaccines that have yet to be approved by the country's FDA.
""Sabihin mo sa DOH asikasuhin nila trabaho nila. Huwag nila pakialaman ang mga senador at congressman... Bakit ba pinapakialaman niyo mga senador saka mga congressman? Kami pwede makialam sa kanila. DOH sila e,"" Sotto said.
[Translation: Tell the DOH to do their job. Don't interfere with senators and congressmen... Why do you interfere with senators and congressmen? We can interfere with them because they're the DOH.]
""Porke hindi approved ng FDA ang isang vaccine, na FDA approved sa ibang bansa, dapat 'wag gamitin ng Pilipino? Is that the point? Ibang klase 'yun,"" he added.
[Translation: Just because a vaccine is not approved by the (country's) FDA, but approved by FDAs in other countries, Filipinos cannot use it? Is that the point? That's something else.]
But asked if he's willing to get vaccinated, Sotto expressed apprehension.
""Kahit anti-flu at anti-pneumonia takot ako. Anti-COVID pa,"" Sotto said.
[Translation: I am afraid of even anti-flu and anti-pneumonia (vaccines). What more of anti-COVID.]

Dela Peña said clinical trials of potential COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines would have to be approved first by the Food and Drug Administration.
Asked if it was possible that the COVID-19 vaccines were administered to Lacson and Romualdez without the DOST's knowledge, Dela Peña said: ""Ang FDA, nasa kanila ang lahat ng karapatan na mag-decide, whether ire-refer nila sa amin o hindi, nasa sa kanila yun.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/11/21/pfizer-biontech-submit-fda-emergency-authorization-covid-vaccine.html,Pfizer and BioNTech to submit to FDA today for emergency authorization for their coronavirus vaccine,Jamie Gumbrecht,2020-11-21 01:00:21,"(CNN) -- Pfizer and BioNTech said they will submit to the US Food and Drug Administration today for an emergency use authorization for their coronavirus vaccine candidate.
This is the first coronavirus vaccine to seek a regulatory OK in the United States.
The companies said in a statement that their vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b2, will potentially be available for use in high-risk populations in the United States by the middle to end of December. The vaccine requires two doses a few weeks apart, and protection is achieved 28 days after the first shot.
The submission to the FDA is based on results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of Pfizer's vaccine, which began in the United States on July 27 and enrolled more than 43,000 volunteers.
ADVERTISEMENT
The final analysis from the trial found the coronavirus vaccine was 95% effective in preventing infections, even in older adults, and caused no serious safety concerns, Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, announced this week. The submission also includes safety data on about 100 children ages 12 to 15.
About 42% of global participants and 30% of US participants in the Phase 3 study have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, the companies said in a news release, and 41% of global and 45% of US participants are ages 56 to 85.
""Filing in the U.S. represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the world and we now have a more complete picture of both the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine, giving us confidence in its potential,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.
Moderna, another pharmaceutical company, announced Monday that early clinical trial results show its vaccine is 94.5% effective. The company plans to apply to the FDA for authorization after it accumulates more safety data later this month.
Emergency use authorization, or EUA, from the FDA is not the same as full approval. An EUA allows products to be used under particular circumstances before all the evidence is available for approval. For an EUA, the agency says it will determine whether a product's ""known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks.""
What happens after an EUA
The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, a group of outside experts, for December 8, 9 and 10, a source familiar with the process told CNN this week. The agency could make a decision at the end of the meeting on December 10 about whether to issue an emergency use authorization, the source said.
""It will make sense that in all likelihood the FDA will consider both applications together,"" the source said, considering that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use the same technology and appear to have very similar safety and efficacy results from their large-scale clinical trials.
If the FDA authorizes the vaccines, they can then be immediately distributed to states, according to a presentation made last month at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
However, no one can be vaccinated until a CDC advisory committee reviews the data, recommends the vaccine, and decides which groups will receive it first.
If the FDA authorizes the vaccines, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent panel of experts, will meet within 24 to 48 hours, according to a CDC spokesperson.
At that meeting, the committee will determine if everyone should get the vaccine, or if some people should be excluded.
""We have all been alerted on ACIP we should be very flexible with our calendars because it's likely there won't be a lot of advanced notice given for this meeting. It will be done very, very quickly,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a committee member, told CNN this week.
Once ACIP issues its recommendations, vaccinations can be given.
""We have a plan in places that the moment that the FDA concludes that that vaccine is safe and effective, we have a system in place to begin within 24 hours to ship that to hospitals and health care officials and 24 hours after that injecting that vaccine into Americans,"" Vice President Mike Pence said during a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing on Thursday.
States are currently working out the details of running vaccination clinics. The Pfizer vaccine is particularly complicated, since it must be stored at minus 75 degrees Celsius, and doctors' offices and pharmacies typically do not have freezers that go that low.
The first groups expected to receive the vaccine are health care workers, the elderly, essential works such as police officers, and those with underlying medical conditions.

No serious adverse effects have been reported from vaccine recipients so far, Sinopharm said Wednesday in an article on social media platform WeChat, citing Chairman Liu Jingzhen.
""In emergency use, we now have used it on nearly a million people. We have not received any reports of serious adverse reaction, and only a few have some mild symptoms,"" Liu said.
Liu said the vaccine had been given to Chinese construction workers, diplomats, and students who have gone to more than 150 countries around the world during the pandemic -- and none of them has reported an infection.
He said on November 6 that there were 56,000 people who had received emergency vaccinations and then gone overseas.
""For example, a transnational company has 99 employees in one of its overseas offices, of whom 81 were vaccinated. And later, an outbreak broke out in the office, 10 of the 18 people who were not vaccinated were infected and none of those vaccinated were infected,"" he said.
He said that separately, Sinopharm had carried out Phase 3 clinical trials involving almost 60,000 people in 10 countries -- including the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru, and Argentina. CNN has not seen the results of these trials yet.
Sinopharm has two vaccine candidates. It's unclear which vaccine Liu referred to.
Beijing has granted approval to companies for urgent vaccinations using experimental drugs for months. In June, Chinese company CanSino Biologics announced it had been given special authorization to administer its experimental vaccine to the People's Liberation Army.
Since July, Chinese drug makers have been administering experimental vaccines to people working in ""high-risk"" professions under the emergency use program, which allows vaccine candidates to be used on a limited scale before their safety and efficacy have been fully proven by clinical trials.
Experimental coronavirus vaccines have even been reportedly offered to the public in parts of China, causing some citizens to rush across the country to get their hands on a dose.
It comes after Pfizer announced the results of its Phase 3 coronavirus vaccine trials on Wednesday, which it said was 95% effective in preventing infections -- even in older adults -- and caused no serious safety concerns. A day earlier, Moderna announced that its coronavirus vaccine was 94.5% effective.
Pfizer is expected to seek US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for its vaccine Friday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had shown extraordinary efficacy.
""That is extraordinary,"" Fauci said. ""That is almost to the level of what we see with measles (vaccine), which is 98% effective.""

Most Americans probably won't get vaccinated until next year. And the fall surge continues to bring a terrifying jump in cases across the US: For the 11th day in a row, Illinois reported more than 10,000 cases in a single day, according to the state Department of Health website. Nationwide, for two straight weeks, the US has added more than 100,000 new cases daily.
Cases in California are up 51.3% in the past week and daily cases have doubled in just 10 days, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. About 70% of the counties in the state are moving back into more restrictive tiers as Newsom used the analogy of ""pulling an emergency brake"" to deal with the crisis.
As vaccination trials continue, tens of thousands of lives could either be saved or lost, depending on how people act. Traditional Thanksgiving gatherings, for example, are a huge concern among health experts and state leaders.
""We simply can't do that right now,"" Walz said as his state reported 24,000 new cases in just three days.
All of this comes as one expert says Covid-19 could become the leading daily cause of death in the US.
""It's more than just heading in the wrong direction,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. ""We are on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.""
Why the 'war' against Covid-19 is getting worse
Much of the current surge is fueled by people hanging out with friends or family who don't live with them -- and wrongfully assuming they're not infected.
US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said all Americans must mask up and double down on safety precautions, including social distancing, as the next few months are expected to be the worst of the pandemic.
""Hard truths: 49/50 states with increasing cases, 34 in red or orange zones (ie significant rise),"" Adams tweeted.
""Record cases over the past week will be record hospitalizations soon. Our/ YOUR communities and hospitals simply can not sustain high level care at this rate of increase.""
Many hospitals are already running out of health care staff. Major surgeries for non-Covid patients are getting delayed. And some patients are several hours away from the closest available ICU bed.
Nationwide, more than 11 million people in the US have been infected with coronavirus, and more than 247,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
If 95% of Americans wore masks consistently, 68,000 lives could be saved by March 1, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
If not, the death toll is expected to reach 439,000 by March 1.
The hospitalization record is shattered, again
A record-high 69,864 Covid-19 patients were hospitalized Sunday, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
That number far exceeds the spring peak of 59,940, on April 15, and the summer peak of 59,718 on July 23.
Hospitalizations will likely keep rising as new infections keep soaring. And the increased case numbers aren't just due to more testing.
The US has averaged 148,725 new Covid-19 cases per day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins. That's a 31% increase in new cases from the previous week.
But the number of new Covid-19 tests performed has increased only 10.42%, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
Bipartisan officials enact new restrictions
A growing number of Republican and Democratic governors and city leaders have issued new mandates to try to stop the crisis from getting worse.
On Monday, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio announced new limits on social gatherings, weddings and funerals.
""Despite the health order that limited mass gatherings to 10 people that was signed in April remaining in effect, we have seen rampant spread of the virus as a result of banquets, wedding receptions, and social gatherings following funerals,"" the governor said.
""We have seen great tragedy associated with such events. It's not the ceremonies causing the problem. It's the party afterward.""
The revised order prohibits dancing or socializing in open, congregate areas. Guests must be seated, and food should be served to them at their seats. No more than 10 people can sit at a table, and those people must be from the same household.
Philadelphia announced new outdoor restrictions. As a result, the Eagles will not be able to host fans at Lincoln Financial Field, the NFL team said in a tweet.
Starting Thursday, all bars and restaurants in Oklahoma must close by 11 p.m. and restaurant tables must be 6 feet apart.
""We need to slow the spread of this virus,"" said Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. ""Data shows that social distancing is harder to maintain as it gets later at night, especially in bars.""
Beginning Tuesday, state employees must wear masks in common areas or when they are close to other workers, Stitt said.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has banned indoor social gatherings with people from different households, unless they take appropriate precautions.
Those precautions include everyone quarantining for 14 days before the gathering, or quarantining for seven days before the gathering and getting a negative Covid-19 test result no more than 48 hours beforehand.
Outdoor gatherings will be limited to five people in Washington state, and restaurants and bars will be limited to outdoor service with capacity limits and to-go service. Stores, including grocery stores, are limited to 25% capacity.
In Michigan, high schools and colleges will shift to remote learning for three weeks. Indoor restaurant dining has been suspended.
In Oregon, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown announced a two-week ""social freeze,"" which includes limiting social gatherings, suspending indoor restaurant dining, and limiting the number of people who can gather for faith-based organizations.
And Republican Govs. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Gary Herbert of Utah are among the latest to mandate face masks across their states.
""Right now, the data demands a higher level of mitigation efforts to reverse this dangerous trends, to slow the spread of the virus, and to avoid the need for any economic shutdowns,"" Burgum said.
Former FDA heads under Trump and Bush call for mask mandates
Health experts have lamented the lack of a strong, coordinated federal response to this pandemic. So it's ""now up to governors"" to enact tough restrictions to get Covid-19 outbreaks under control, two former commissioners of the Food and Drug Administration wrote.
""At least while infections are widespread and surging, governors and local leaders should mandate the use of masks and impose clear and consistent plans to restrict gatherings,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Mark McClellan wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.
""Americans are understandably tired of Covid, but accepting temporary restrictions now will help prevent even more painful personal and economic disruptions.""
Gottlieb worked in the Trump administration, and McClellan worked in the George W. Bush administration.
Many governors have taken aggressive steps to slow the spread,"" they wrote, ""but states that don't act quickly put the entire nation at risk.""
'This winter will be hard'
Yes, there's great news with two vaccine trials -- one from Moderna, and one from Pfizer/BioNTech.
But let's be clear: There will be no return to normal this year, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said.
""This winter will be hard. We will not have a big impact on the infection numbers with our vaccine this winter,"" Sahin told the BBC.
Last week, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said ""we believe that we are in good situation to have up to 50 million doses this year, globally, and I believe we are in a very, very good situation to have 1.3 billion doses globally next year.""
But just like the Moderna vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses for each person.
So if 50 million doses are available worldwide by the end of this year, that would mean 25 million people could get vaccinated.
Moderna, Pfizer and other companies making vaccines must first ask for and then receive emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration before they can start distributing their vaccines.

""So tatapusin muna 'yan nila bago 'yan sila magbigay sa iba (So they will first complete the vaccination among their populations before they would offer a supply to other countries),"" he said.
American pharmaceutical company Pfizer recently reported that its coronavirus vaccine, which it made with its German partner BioNTech, is more than 90% effective based on its early analysis.

Amnesty International, however, has raised the alarm over the two firms striking deals with wealthy countries ""for more than a billion potential doses of its vaccine."" The organization said this leaves only a small fraction of potential supply for other nations, especially low- and middle-income ones.
Meanwhile, Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babes"" Romualdez is confident the country will work out a good deal with Pfizer, owing to the Philippines being a U.S. ally. 
In his previous public addresses, Duterte repeatedly pinned his hopes on a vaccine that will be produced by either China or Russia, even offering himself to be vaccinated first amid safety concerns.
In June, Malacañang said Chinese leader Xi Jinping has assured Duterte that the Philippines would be prioritized once China develops a vaccine against the highly contagious disease. ",CNN
http://cnnphilippines.com/business/2020/11/10/pfizer-covid-vaccine-timing.html,Pfizer CEO: Our vaccine timing had nothing to do with politics,Alexis Benveniste,2020-11-10 20:41:05,"(CNN) — Pfizer's encouraging news about the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccine came nearly a week after Election Day. But Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says the timing had nothing to do with politics.
In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, Bourla said he first learned about the results of the trial Sunday and he has yet to see the data, throwing cold water on the idea that there was any political motivation behind releasing the news after voters in the United States chose their candidate for president.
Pfizer took several interim looks at the data during its vaccine trial, but it did not have enough infections in its test group to gain any meaningful data — until Sunday, Gupta reported. If anything, the data came earlier than expected: In October, Bourla made a comment  in an open letter on Pfizer's website, saying, ""Based on our current trial enrollment and dosing pace, we estimate we will reach this milestone in the third week of November.""
The Trump administration was quick to take credit for Pfizer's promising news. US Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that Pfizer's development was ""thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President Donald Trump.""
US President Trump, however, lashed out at Pfizer and the FDA over the drug company's announcement.
""As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn't have the courage to do it before,"" Trump tweeted Monday evening. ""Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives!"" he tweeted.
Moments later, Trump wrote in another tweet if US President-elect Biden were president, ""you wouldn't have the Vaccine for another four years.""

Not warp speed
Yet Pfizer was not part of the Trump administration's ""Operation Warp Speed,"" which provided incentives to pharmaceutical companies to ramp up their development of a coronavirus vaccine.
The US federal government promised $1.95 billion to Pfizer (PFE) and partner BioNTech (BNTX) to assist with the distribution of the vaccine once it's ready — but the government is not directly working to help its development.
Trump had called drug companies, pressuring them for new developments before Election Day. He explicitly told the companies' CEOs that he'd like to see a vaccine move quicker than some of his health advisers said was reasonable, CNN has reported.
On Monday morning, President-elect Joe Biden issued a statement welcoming the ""excellent news"" and congratulating the ""brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough.""
He added that ""it is also important to understand that the end of the battle against COVID-19 is still months away"" and ""it will be many more months before there is a widespread vaccination"" in the United States.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Pfizer's vaccine news bodes well for other COVID-19 vaccines in development and added that Pfizer was able to get results quickly due to the severity of the pandemic.
Making the vaccine
Although the vaccine is not set to be widely administered soon, Pfizer said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months following their second dose of the vaccine.
Pfizer has at least three vaccine manufacturing sites in the United States, Gupta said. At the Kalamazoo, Michigan, facility, there are several refrigerators — that span about the length of a football field — that are used to store the vaccine.
For months companies have been racing to develop, and eventually distribute, an effective coronavirus vaccine. The race shows no signs of slowing as companies continue to move their vaccine candidates through clinical trials, growing closer to determining which will be considered safe and effective.
Vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna utilize new technology that has never been used in vaccines before, and experts say that in itself is a reason to be cautious.
While the developments mean that progress is being made, they will do little to mitigate the coronavirus winter surge in the short term given that it will be well into 2021 before the dose is available to all Americans.

Instead, they should wear a mask — which is probably even more effective, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
While a ""very limited supply"" of a Covid-19 vaccine might be ready in November or December, it ""will have to be prioritized,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told a Senate appropriations subcommittee Wednesday.
""It will be those first responders and those at greatest risk for death, and then eventually that will expand,"" he said.
""If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public, so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we're probably looking at third, late second quarter, third quarter 2021.""
ADVERTISEMENT
On top of that, ""in order to have enough of us immunized so we have immunity, I think it's going to take us six to nine months,"" he said.
Vaccine distrust remains an issue
Then there's the issue that needs to be urgently addressed: people who are hesitant to get the vaccine, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Wednesday.
""Those who are vaccine hesitant have had their hesitancy enhanced by a variety of things that are happening right now, particularly the unfortunate mix of science and politics,"" Collins said at an event hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than half of respondents -- 54% -- said they would not get the vaccine if it was available for free before the November 3 presidential election. Along party lines, 60% of Republicans and 56% of independents said they would not. Half of Democrats said they would.
""I don't want to have us, a year from now, having a conversation about how we have in our hands the solution to the worst pandemic of more than 100 years, but we haven't been able to actually convince people to take charge of it,"" Collins said.
And distrust in government agencies is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spread, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
""It is very challenging in many areas today, where we're seeing people who do not want to participate in any kind of follow up with regard to surveillance, because of their distrust of government and the public health system,"" c said during an American Public Health Association webinar.
Surveillance helps public health officials by collecting information on infected people, such as where they were exposed and who they've been in contact with, and the course of their illness.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, said the variability in how the coronavirus affects people has helped fuel misunderstandings about who can spread the virus and when.
At least 40% of patients have no symptoms, while some stay ill for months on end, Fauci said.
""One of the things we're dealing with in this country is a real lack of understanding of the importance of everybody trying to prevent getting infected rather than inadvertently... propagating the outbreak..."" Fauci said during a virtual panel sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.
Of all the viral diseases and emerging infections that he's encountered throughout his career, Fauci said he has ""never seen anything with a range"" like this virus.
""It's just completely unique to see that degree of variability of a single microbe, which means there are things that are determining that, that we still at this point don't understand,"" he said.
Masks are a 'powerful' tool, Redfield said
But Redfield said Americans already have a weapon he believes could be more effective against Covid-19: face masks.
""These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have,"" Redfield said, holding up a blue face mask.
""If we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks, we'd bring this pandemic under control,"" he said.
""I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take a Covid vaccine, because the immunogenicity may be 70%. And if I don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me. This face mask will.""
Yet time and again, people gather and socialize without wearing face masks -- sometimes leading to tragic results.
More than 6.6 million people have been infected with Covid-19 in the US, and more than 196,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
7 coronavirus deaths are linked to 1 wedding
A wedding in Maine is linked to 176 Covid-19 cases and the deaths of seven people who didn't attend the celebration -- showing just how easily and quickly coronavirus can spread at social gatherings, public health experts say.
For months, doctors have stressed the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings.
But outbreaks have stemmed from Memorial Day events, Fourth of July celebrations and a massive motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.
The wedding in Millinocket on August 7 had about 65 guests, a violation of the state's 50-person limit for indoor events, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The event is linked to outbreaks that have unfolded at a nursing home and a jail, both more than 100 miles away from the wedding venue, among people who had only secondary or tertiary contact with an attendee.
Residents at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center accounted for 39 cases tied to the wedding and six of the seven deaths thus far, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said.
""The virus favors gatherings,"" Shah added. ""It does not distinguish between happy events like a wedding celebration, or sad farewells, like a funeral.""
Despite such somber warnings, about 1,500 people descended on a New Jersey boardwalk house featured in MTV's ""Jersey Shore"" on Monday night, ending in eight arrests, Seaside Heights police said.
The event was organized by a group of YouTube pranksters, according to Seaside Heights Police Detective Steve Korman, and officials say they are now worried about how they will track possible infections among more than a thousand people.
Universities try to get ahead of outbreaks
Outbreaks keep cropping up at colleges and universities, prompting some to go to virtual learning again.
More than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported at colleges and universities in all 50 states.
Citing a significant rise in cases among students, the University of Colorado Boulder announced a 14-day quarantine period for students living within the city.
The University of Arizona is taking a similar approach, urging students to shelter in place until the end of the month after a large number of positive cases. The university reported 261 positive cases on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard.
At the University of Missouri, two students were expelled and three were suspended for violating rules that require students who test positive to isolate and comply with social distancing.
""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable. We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students,"" the university said in a statement Tuesday
Returning to normal is a long way off
Officials are trying to prepare the public for a pandemic-altered life for a few more months -- if not years.
Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief science officer at the World Health Organization in Geneva, said the world might not be able to return to ""pre-Covid"" life until 2022.
Swaminathan said 60% to 70% of the global population would need to have immunity before there is a dramatic reduction in transmission of the virus.
""We're looking at 2022 at least before enough people start getting the vaccine to build immunity,"" she told journalists during a virtual meeting hosted by the United Nations Foundation.
""So for a long time to come, we have to maintain the same kind of measures that are currently being put in place with physical distancing, the masking and respiratory hygiene.""

“The integration of sites in Europe, and now especially in Germany, is aimed at supporting an approval in Europe,"" said Ugur Sahin, CEO and cofounder of BioNTech, in a news release on Monday.
The BNT162b2 mRNA-based vaccine candidate is already in similar large-scale trials in the United States. The trial involves giving the participants two doses of a 30 microgram vaccine – one on the first day and one 28 days later – with participants being followed up for up to two years after they receive the second dose.
In August, the companies presented ""promising"" results in early data on safety and immune responses in their ongoing Phase 1/2 study in the United States. Among both younger and older adults in the trial, the companies said the vaccine ""was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever in fewer than 20% of the participants."" The companies also noted in their news release that seven days after participants were given a second dose of the vaccine at 30 micrograms, the vaccine was able to elicit neutralizing antibodies in younger adults ages 18 to 55, and in older adults ages 65 to 85.

The data has not yet published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.
The companies plan to seek regulatory authorization or approval for the drug as early as October if it is successful in clinical trial testing. They plan to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.
Many infectious disease experts say, however, that it’s highly unlikely Pfizer will have enough data to allow for an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration in October.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/9/6/Russia-Sputnik-V-COVID-vaccine-frontliner-workers.html,Putin's vaccine meets opposition from frontline workers in Russia,Zahra Ullah and Anna Chernova,2020-09-06 16:52:17,"(CNN)— Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the approval of Russia's Sputnik-V coronavirus vaccine on August 11 amid much fanfare, saying it works ""quite effectively"" in forming a stable immunity.
How would he know this? Because the Russian President revealed one of his daughters had already taken it.
Speaking on Russian state TV at the time, Putin said his daughter had a slightly higher temperature after each dose of the two-stage coronavirus vaccine, but that ""Now she feels well.""
Russian authorities have singled out teachers -- as well as doctors -- as key workers who will get access to the vaccine first, even before crucial phase 3 human trials have finished.
But that's not gone down well with some sections of these frontline workers who don't buy Putin's claims of the efficacy of the vaccine and are reluctant to be used as human guinea pigs.
On September 1, Russian classrooms reopened for the first time since March amid the Covid-19 pandemic -- the same day the country surpassed 1 million coronavirus cases. Teachers were meant to be among the first to benefit from Russia's new coronavirus vaccine, especially given the close contact with hundreds of children that they are exposed to on a daily basis. But CNN is learning that few -- if any -- have so far taken up the offer to be vaccinated.
Developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, the Sputnik-V vaccine was named after the surprise 1957 launch of the world's first satellite by the Soviet Union.

Russia's claim of victory at being the first to approve a coronavirus vaccine in a worldwide pandemic was initially met with widespread concern and unanswered questions over its safety and effectiveness, and not just from outside the country.
A Russian teachers' union, ""Uchitel,"" started an online petition calling on members to reject the vaccine outright on safety grounds, and expressing concern that vaccination -- currently voluntary -- should not be made mandatory unless clinical trials are complete.
Reality can differ from promises
Yuri Varlamov, a teacher in Moscow and a member of the union, said he doesn't want to take the vaccine because he doesn't believe it is safe right now.
""Before the end of trials, they cannot make it mandatory. But I know that in some schools and state bodies, people are talking about mandatory status of this vaccine by the end of this year,"" Varlamov said.
Marina Balouyeva, co-chairman of the ""Uchitel"" union, said a petition against compulsory vaccination for teachers was more of a precaution.
Balouyeva said she is wary of Sputnik-V for several reasons. ""Firstly, it is generally known that the quality of domestic vaccines is worse than that of foreign ones,"" she said.
""Secondly, the vaccine was created at railway speed, which already raises concerns. It was created in haste.""
Despite promises from authorities that taking the vaccine will be voluntary, she said she fears things could go differently in reality, as often happens in Russian state institutions.
Balouyeva said no complaints have yet been made to her union from teachers saying they are being forced to be vaccinated. However, previous experience indicates there have been such problems with other vaccines, she says.
For example, officially, the seasonal flu shot is not mandatory for Russian educational workers -- it is voluntary. But according to Balouyeva some schools require it from their employees without fail.
Whether there will be sanctions on those unwilling to be vaccinated with Sputnik-V, depends on the headteacher. Most schools have a so-called ""incentive bonus"" -- a fund of money that the administration can distribute as they see fit. Some teachers could be deprived of this payment if they don't get the vaccine.
Balouyeva is all too familiar with the consequences that follow if you go against the school administration.
Having successfully worked for 15 years as an English teacher at a correctional school for children with cerebral palsy in St. Petersburg, Balouyeva says she was fired last year for an ""unexplained absence"" for not working during a school holiday.
It happened shortly after she was publicly vocal about teachers' salaries being lower than figures published in official documents.
""Teachers are a very disenfranchised category, just like doctors,"" the former teacher said, adding that the temptation to test the vaccine on them is immense. ""It is both cheap and practical -- why not do it, from the point of view of the authorities?""
CNN was given access by local authorities to one of Moscow's top public schools, where some measures -- like testing and teachers in facemasks -- have been implemented.
But no one CNN spoke to at School 1363 said they had taken the vaccine, although theysay they will ""definitely"" do so soon. Deputy head Maria Zatolokina said: ""I think that every teacher understands how important it is to be safe and to create a safe environment for our students to be healthy. That's why I hope that we are responsible people, and we should [all] be vaccinated.""
Political pressure
Critics such as Anastasia Vasilyeva, a Russian doctor turned prominent campaigner and ally of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, says the country's push for a vaccine comes amid political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray Russia as a global scientific force. Navalny is currently being treated in a Berlin hospital after a suspected poisoning attempt in Siberia last month.
""I think it's to show Russia is a big strong country, that Putin is a big strong president,"" Vasilyeva told CNN.
Her colleague, a surgeon at a hospital in northeast Moscow, shared his concerns about the vaccine with CNN, strictly on the condition of anonymity, due to fear of facing repercussions at work, if he came out publicly against the vaccine. When offered the vaccine in early August, he started consulting with experts.
""I am not a vaccine specialist,"" he admits, ""So, I called the doctors who deal with vaccinations, I called immunologists. They said, 'don't do it, by no means, the vaccine is raw.'""
It was a friendly offer, he says, no pressure, no obligations. But no matter how hard the deputy chief physician tried to persuade the surgeon that the vaccine is ""perfectly normal, good, amazing,"" the doctor still was reluctant to try it on himself.
""Explain to me: how could it be that such powerful European and international organizations could not do it, but a relatively small Gamaleya Institute could? I cannot understand it,"" the surgeon said.
He didn't know when the vaccine would be delivered to his hospital but said very few of his colleagues would have the courage to refuse it.
""Totalitarianism remains [in Russia]. The two most helpless sectors are education and health care. Everything is done forcefully here. Last year I had a flu shot, everyone was told they needed to be vaccinated. And everyone did it, because if you don't, there will be penalties.""
But it isn't just doctors and teachers who voiced concerns Russia may have cut essential corners in development.
Polls suggest around half of Russian citizens have doubts about the vaccine, the Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said on Friday during a video conference with Putin. He added, however, that two months ago, the figure was almost 90%.
Sobyanin, who revealed he had been vaccinated with Sputnik-V, was speaking just moments after Russia published its peer-reviewed data from phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in The Lancet medical journal, which suggest the Russian vaccine has a good safety profile and produced no serious adverse side effects.
Scientists not involved in the study said while the results are a positive sign, only larger, Phase 3 trials can confirm whether the vaccine actually prevents illness with Covid-19.
The Russian defense minister was also shown getting the shot. It seems Russia's messaging about the vaccine has gone into full overdrive following the publication of its scientific data. It remains to be seen if the tide of public opinion and front-line workers will change over time too.

China and Russia say they will start deploying vaccines before completing late-stage clinical trials, and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn has said if the US gets enough data from advanced trials, it might be possible to authorize a vaccine before the trials are completed.
Asked about what the three countries are planning, WHO officials said it’s important to make sure a vaccine is at least safe and works before using one broadly.
“The emergency use authorization or licensing is something that has to be done with a great deal of seriousness and reflection. It’s not something that you do very lightly,” WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said during a news briefing.

While it is up to the national regulatory authority of every country to make decisions about approvals, WHO has on its website a guidance document that lays out step-by-step what the approach for their emergency use listing procedure would be, she said.
Any country’s vaccine policy “must be guided by the highest possible ethical standard, the highest possible scientific standards,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program.
There are examples of vaccines that were rolled out before data collection was complete, Ryan added. Ebola is one. But data was carefully collected even as groups rushed to vaccinate people during recent Ebola outbreaks.
“You need to maintain monitoring,” Ryan said.

In a media forum, Health spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire said the proposed sites for the trials include the Philippine General Hospital, San Lazaro hospital, Manila Doctors Hospital, the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine, and the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center.
Vergeire noted drug importer IP Biotech Inc. has submitted an application for the clinical study before the Food and Drug Administration.
“May prinoprocess na application for the clinical study. They have already submitted, na-final na ang CDA, Confidential Disclosure Agreement, at pinag-aaralan na ng vaccines experts' panel,” Vergeire said.

The Phase 3 of the clinical trial for CoronaVac already began in Indonesia this August. CNN Indonesia reported that the aim is to test the vaccine on 1,620 individuals. At least 110 of them received the first dose on August 14.
The Phase 3 trial is the critical stage where thousands of patients are vaccinated to test the drug's safety and efficacy. The completion of this stage is required before the FDA reviews the vaccine for mass rollout.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/8/12/russia-covid-vaccine-sputnik-v.html,What we know — and don't know —about Russia's 'Sputnik V' vaccine,Zamira Rahim,2020-08-12 19:27:12,"(CNN) — Russia raised eyebrows on Tuesday when it announced the world's first approved coronavirus vaccine for public use.
President Vladimir Putin says his own daughter has already received it, but testing is yet to be completed and experts are skeptical about how quickly the vaccine has been registered.
While details about the research behind the vaccine are limited, here's what we know so far.
What do we know about the Russian vaccine?
The vaccine was developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, using funding from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). The vaccine is named Sputnik V -- a reference to the 1957 Soviet Union satellite.
Scientists conducted months of human trials but are yet to publish data and did not begin the crucial Phase 3 stage, which usually precedes approval, before the announcement on Tuesday.
On Wednesday it was announced that a Phase 3 trial involving more than 2,000 people in Russia and several Middle Eastern and Latin American countries had begun. Typically this stage of trial involves testing on tens of thousands of people.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said Tuesday that the number of people the vaccine had been tested on so far was the equivalent of a Phase 1 trial, which typically involves a small group and studies the safety of the vaccine.
ADVERTISEMENT
Is the Russian vaccine safe?
The short answer is that we don't know. Russia has released no scientific data on its vaccine testing and CNN is unable to verify claims about its safety or effectiveness. But Russia says the vaccine has passed through Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials which were completed on August 1.
A Phase 1 study typically focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and whether it elicits an immune response in a small number of people.
""We do not have any information whatsoever on whether this is safe,"" Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University of Nottingham, told CNN.
Russia claims that volunteers in the Phase 1 and 2 trials felt well after taking the vaccine, and exhibited no unforeseen or unwanted side effects.
Neal said that researchers were unlikely to have detected any rare side effects linked to the Gamaleya vaccine.
""You won't know about side effects without [widespread] testing, if they're rare. That's the point of a Phase 3 study,"" he said.
""I wouldn't take it, certainly not outside of a clinical trial right now,"" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.
Is the vaccine effective?
Without data and completed Phase 3 trials, Russia has not proven to the world Sputnik V works.
""I would think that it at least produces antibodies. What we don't know is if it protects people against infection,"" Neal told CNN.
Russia has said that its vaccine is an adenoviral vector one. Adenoviruses cause the common cold, but in Covid-19 vaccines they're weakened and modified to deliver genetic material that codes for a protein from the novel coronavirus.
The body then produces that protein and may produce an immune response against it but the method can cause problems.
Sputnik V's makers say the vaccine induced a ""strong antibody and cellular immune response,"" in trial volunteers, according to the official website for the vaccine.
""Not a single participant of the current clinical trials got infected with Covid-19 after being administered with the vaccine,"" the statement adds.
""It's not clear how efficacious the Russian vaccine is going to be and whether or not people have some prior immunity to the adenovirus that they're using to deliver the coronavirus gene sequence,"" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expressed similar concerns.
""I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that,"" Fauci told Deborah Roberts of ABC News for a National Geographic event to broadcast Thursday. A portion of the interview was posted by National Geographic on Tuesday.
How did Russia pull this off so quickly?
In April, Russia enacted a law which eliminated the need for a Phase 3 vaccine trial before approval.
Approval now means the coronavirus vaccine can be distributed even as Phase 3 tests get underway -- though practically speaking, mass-manufactured doses aren't expected to be ready for weeks.
""They're not as far ahead as other vaccines,"" Neal said, noting that Moderna and Oxford's vaccines have already begun Phase 3 trials.
Critics say Russia's haste is partly due to political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray the country as a global scientific force.
Russia is not alone when it comes to fast tracking -- China approved an experimental coronavirus vaccine in June for members of its military.
And while its vaccine data from Phase 1 and 2 trials are yet to be published, US, UK and Canadian security officials warned in July that Russian cyber actors were targeting organizations involved in coronavirus vaccine development.
Who will get it first?
Russia's Health Ministry has said the country's frontline medical staff and teachers will be the first vaccinated.
The country plans to begin mass vaccination of citizens in October, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the RDIF told CNN on Tuesday.
""We will start massive vaccination of Russians in October. This vaccine will be available to other countries around November,"" Dmitriev told CNN's Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
At the end of July officials denied reports that members of the country's political and business elite -- including Putin -- had been given early access to the vaccine.
Russia plans to mass produce the vaccine by September 2020.
Which countries will take the vaccine? And which won't?
A lot of countries appear keen to try Sputnik V. Dmitriev said at a Tuesday press conference that Russia had ""received preliminary applications for over 1 billion doses of the vaccine from 20 countries.""
""Countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia have displayed the greatest interest in the vaccine, and we are about to finalize a number of contracts for the purchase of the vaccine,"" he added.
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has publicly expressed his enthusiasm for the vaccine and claimed that he is willing to volunteer in further trials.
""I will volunteer to receive it in public. I will be the first to be experimented on,"" Duterte said during his address to the Philippines late Monday broadcast by state-run RTVM.
As it stands, the Russian vaccine is unlikely to be meet approval regulations for European Union countries and in the US, will need the FDA's approval.
""The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have fast-track approval procedures for emergency humanitarian use and we need to see evidence that Russia is adopting an equally prudent approach,"" said Duncan Matthews, Professor of IP Law at Queen Mary University of London, in a statement to the Science Media Center.
""The point is not to be first with a vaccine. The point is to have a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people and the people of the world,"" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on ABC Tuesday.

CNN has obtained part of a Friday, July 31 email from Moderna, the company running the trial, that states 1,290 people were randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or a dummy shot as of that date. The trial began on Monday, July 27.
The email was sent to sites across the US that are participating in the Moderna trial. Moderna plans to enroll 30,000 people at its 89 sites.
""We hope within a period of a few months, a couple of months, that we'll be able to enroll hopefully by the end of the summer so that we can start getting some results,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said July 27 when he announced the start of the Phase 3 trial.
Fauci told CNN that he expects to get an answer about whether the vaccine works in November or December. ""Maybe we'll get an answer as early as October, but I doubt it,"" he said.
If the pace of enrollment in the first week of the trial -- 1,290 over five days -- were to continue, the study wouldn't be fully enrolled until late fall or early winter. But Fauci told CNN he expects the enrollment numbers to increase as the study continues.
""The first week had very few sites activated,"" he said. ""As more sites get activated, enrollment will very likely increase significantly.""
Each participant receives two injections spaced about 28 days apart.
In a statement, Moderna said they are ""on track to complete enrollment in September, 2020. The company will provide an update when enrollment is complete.""
At the July 27 briefing, Fauci said he hoped for much higher enrollment numbers -- but he now says he was joking.
""We'd like to have 15,000 by the end of the week. I'm not sure that we're going to get there, but hopefully we'll get as many as we possibly can in order to keep our timelines where we need to be,"" Fauci said at the briefing.
But Thursday he told CNN he meant that ""tongue-in-cheek.""
More than 310,000 people have registered with the the COVID-19 Prevention Network to take part in clinical trials for a vaccine or monoclonal antibody treatment for coronavirus. The group is aiming to register ""millions"" of people, according to Dr. Jim Kublin, executive director of operations for the network.
President Trump said Thursday that he was ""optimistic"" a vaccine would be ready around election day on November 3.
""I believe we'll have the vaccine before the end of the year, certainly, but around that date, yes. I think so,"" Trump told reporters. On Monday, Trump said ""we're on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year.""

MANILA — Coronavirus infections in the Philippines climbed to 600,428 on Tuesday after the Department of Health (DOH) reported 2,668 new COVID-19 cases.
During the past few days, the country was logging more than 3,000 daily cases.
Tuesday's tally did not include data from 8 laboratories that failed to submit results on time.The DOH also announced 7 new COVID-related deaths or a total of 12,528 fatalities, accounting for 2.09 percent of the cumulative total cases.
There are also 171 new recovered patients or a total of 546,078 recoveries.
Active cases in the country stood at 41,822, or 7 percent of the cumulative total.
Of those currently battling the disease, 91.6% have mild symptoms, 3.9% are asymptomatic, 1.8% are in critical condition, 1.9% have severe symptoms, and 0.8% have moderate symptoms.
A total of 3 cases, all tagged as recovered, were removed from the official tally for being duplicate entries.
There were also 2 cases tagged as recovered that turned out to be deaths.
The increase in cases in the country has been mainly driven by a spike in infections in the National Capital Region and other areas such cities in Cebu.
The World Health Organization on Tuesday said the surge is not actually considered a second wave since the Philippines never really flattened its cases. The international body called it “another spike in the ongoing wave.”
The WHO said that while more transmissible variants have been detected in the Philippines, their number is small compared to the total.
The DOH has repeatedly said that the increase in cases is due to the non-compliance in health protocols, aggravated by the variants. But the WHO also mentioned the need for quicker and more unified local government response.READ: Not 2nd wave: Rise of COVID cases in NCR a ‘spike’ in ongoing wave, says WHO

The group called for local governments to further intensify COVID-response efforts, which includes localized lockdowns, expanded testing and contact tracing.

This month marks one year since Metro Manila and other parts of the country were placed under community quarantine to curb the spread of the disease.
The country is on Week 2 of its COVID-19 vaccination rollout, using products from Sinovac and AstraZeneca.
The Philippines' first COVID-19 case was confirmed on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.
There are almost 48.2 million people currently infected with COVID-19 worldwide. Since the start of the pandemic, almost 117.2 million people have contracted the disease, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus dashboard. Of those, 2.6 million have died and 66.4 million have recovered.

Isay Reyes, ABS-CBN News
MANILA — The head of Parañaque City's Health Office on Saturday became the first person in the Philippines to receive the first-ever dose of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, a shipment of which arrived in the country earlier this week via the COVAX Facility.Dr. Olga Virtusio, who is 60 years old, is among those prioritized for the AstraZeneca vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration said is suitable for senior citizens. It was the second brand to reach the Philippines, next to Chinese firm Sinovac's CoronaVac.
Virtusio said she prepared for the vaccination by getting enough sleep and by eating healthy food. She said she felt no adverse side effects even after the observation period.“I think being the head of our city health office in Parañaque City… prompted me to lead my staff to show the people that this is a very safe vaccine. I don’t think dapat tayo matakot sa bakuna,” she said.“Nahihiya ako, di ko naman alam na ako 'yung una. I’m very proud and happy. Noon pa lang gusto ko na sa Sinovac pero they stopped me,” she added.(I don’t think we should be scared to be vaccinated, I am shy and I did not expect that I would be the first to be inoculated. I wanted to have Sinovac before but they stopped me.)

Unlike China’s Sinovac vaccine, which arrived last Sunday, AstraZeneca shots can be administered to the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. However, it is not yet recommended for those below 18.
The Ospital ng Parañaque District II was the first hospital to receive AstraZeneca vaccines, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said. The hospital received an allotment of 200 doses meant for senior citizen health care workers.“After the AstraZeneca vaccines arrived, we are blessed to be chosen as the venue of the first vaccination of the AstraZeneca in the country. This will be very helpful especially to the senior citizens,” Dr. Jefferson Pagsisihan, the hospital director, said.

The AstraZeneca shipment of 487,200 jabs on Thursday via the COVAX facility was the second batch of vaccines to officially reach the country, following the arrival of the Sinovac shots on Sunday.A total of 38,400 more doses of AstraZeneca shots are set to arrive Sunday.

VACCINE ROLLOUTOn Friday, there were 9,000 medical frontliners who were vaccinated with Sinovac, close to their target range of 10,000 health workers a day.Parañaque City Mayor Edwin Olivarez said that of the 3,800 health care workers in the city, 90 percent expressed willingness to be vaccinated. The remaining 10 percent, meanwhile, have their reservations.“We’re very happy and thankful na napili tayo na unang-una dito sa Metro Manila o sa buong bansa. Makita po natin dito halos 90 percent is willing, very willing. Our health care workers are very willing,” Olivarez said.(I am happy and thankful that we are the first city to be chosen in Metro Manila and the entire country for the vaccine rollout. We can see that almost 90 percent said they are very willing to be vaccinated.)Galvez, meanwhile, noted positive response to the Sinovac rollout despite earlier concerns expressed by health workers over its lower efficacy rate compared to other brands.
The official also emphasized that the President’s strict instruction was to prioritize the inoculation of some 1.7 million health care workers in the country whose vaccination is targeted to be finished by April.He added that the government would prioritize the vaccination in areas with high COVID-19 cases, including Metro Manila and Central Visayas.“Nakita natin na kung sino 'yung mga hindi nabigyan ng Sinovac at willing mabigyan ng bakuna, 'yun ang bibigyan natin. Ang priority is 'yung mga lugar na may pagtaas at nakita namin 'yung tumataas 'yung new cases 'yung NCR, Region 8, 7, Baguio and Davao City.” he said.(We identified the places that will not be given Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine and those areas willing to receive it. Our priority are the places with high COVID-19 infections and where cases recently spiked like NCR, Region 8, 7, Baguio and Davao City.)More than 13,000 health workers so far have been vaccinated against COVID-19 in the Philippines as of Friday night, days after the inoculation drive began across the country, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said earlier in the day.READ: Over 13,000 health workers vaccinated vs COVID-19 in PH as of Friday: DOH

Mabilis at marami agad sapagkat ito ang makapagbibigay sa atin in the long run ng proteksiyon,” Dr. Maria Consorcia Quizon, a member of the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) for COVID-19 vaccines, said in an interview on TeleRadyo.(The most important thing that experts say is to be expedient, to speed up vaccinating many people because this will provide us protection in the long run.)

The Philippines on Monday began its vaccination program, inoculating mostly health workers using jabs donated by China’s Sinovac Biotech. A shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines, meanwhile, arrived in the Philippines on Thursday through the vaccine-sharing platform COVAX Facility.“That is what we have at the moment. Kahit lumitaw na sa Pilipinas ay may variant, ang mas nakakarami pa rin ay 'yung naunang COVID so makakaprotekta pa rin sa atin,"" she said.
(This is what we have at the moment. Even if there is a presence of a variant in the Philippines, majority is the first COVID so the vaccines can still protect us.)
Quizon said vaccine brands being rolled out around the world help protect patients and their communities from COVID-19, regardless of its efficacy rate.
None of the vaccines can say that its efficacy is 100 percent, she added, and brands whose rating is not that high can still be protective.The OCTA Research Group earlier said that the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine decreases from 70 percent to 10 percent in cases of the South African COVID-19 variant.

There is no vaccine that currently addresses this particular variant and the other mutations. Quizon said the vaccines that have been developed by various firms around the world were intended to address the first strain.
She emphasized that COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against the disease developing into a more severe form, helping prevent death.“Wala pa talagang makakapagsabi na one is better than the other,” she said.“Sa vaccines na meron tayo good for naunang coronavirus kaya di natin masabi kung talagang totally effective itong version na ito for that variant. Pero inaasahan natin na sooner or later magdadagdag sila o magte-tweak sila ng vaccine na 'yun para matugunan din o malabanan din itong variant na ito.”
(No one can say that one is better than the other. The vaccines that we have is good for the first coronavirus that's why we cannot say if it's going to be effective also for that variant. But we expect, sooner or later, that they would add or tweak the vaccines to address or fight this variant.)On Friday, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the Philippines has recorded a total of 52 cases of the more transmissible South African variant and 42 additional virus cases with potential clinical significance. He also reported 31 newly-reported cases of the UK variant. PH logs 52 more cases of S. African COVID-19 variant, 42 other mutations

OCTA researchers flag infections spike in Pasay
MANILA—The COVID-19 positivity rate in Metro Manila is rising steadily as daily coronavirus cases continue to increase, too, analysts said Friday, sounding the alarm on a possible ""overwhelming"" surge of infections in the National Capital Region (NCR).
The OCTA Research Group said in a report that the number of new COVID-19 cases in the NCR continued to increase, as it tallied over 900 new infections per day from February 26 to March 4. According to the analysts, the ratio of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the region increased to an average of 7 percent over the past 7 days and has risen by 1-percentage point every week.
In Pasay City alone, the group noted 150 new COVID-19 cases were logged from February 26 to March 4, the ""highest average daily new cases"" there. Besides Pasay, other cities in Metro Manila recorded ""marginal"" increase in coronavirus infections, the OCTA said.
""Based on our analysis of the data and the past trends in the NCR, we believe that a surge in its early stages has already started in some LGUs in the region,"" the research group said.
""Unlike past surges experienced, the current surge has spread very quickly in a short period. The increase in cases and the reproduction number indicates that the virus is already spreading exponentially in several LGUs in the region.
The single-day tally of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines reached 3,045 Friday, the highest since October 16, 2020. Analysts have been pointing out that cases in some areas of Metro Manila and Region 7 continue to increase.
Philippines logs 3,045 more COVID-19 cases, highest since October
The OCTA believes the surge of cases in Metro Manila could have been caused by the COVID-19 variants that have entered the country, including the UK and South African strains, which can overwhelm the region if ignored.

Gov't targets ‘fast containment’ of South African variant in PH
""It is important to stress the urgency of the situation as the UK and South African variants, which have already been identified in the NCR, are game-changing variants because they are more contagious and lethal and can potentially undermine our vaccination program,"" the analysts stressed.
""The priority now is to contain or mitigate the spread of these more contagious and lethal variants apart from preventing the surge in the region from becoming full-blown.""
WATCH: PH daily COVID-19 cases hit record high in 5 months amid vaccination drive
While the surge in the NCR is a serious problem, it can be abated or even reversed if it is addressed by national and local government officials, private sector and the public, the OCTA said.
""To achieve this, we need to act as one and we need to act now while the situation in the region is still manageable,"" the group emphasized, urging national government and local government officials in Metro Manila to further intensify efforts and expand COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, isolation, and localized lockdowns to curb the transmission of the deadly disease.
The cities of Cebu, Lapu Lapu, Mandaue, Davao, Baguio and Bacoor were also exhorted to do the same due to their number of daily COVID-19 cases.
""Furthermore, in the identified NCR LGUs, the implementation of more effective localized lockdowns with stricter border controls are urgently needed to suppress further viral transmissions. Effective and more stringent border controls must be observed to mitigate
COVID-19 transmissions from the NCR and between provinces and prevent the spread of the virus,"" OCTA said.
Regulations for int'l travelers must be re-evaluated
The researchers believe the surge in COVID-19 cases in the affected cities was caused by community transmission, likely aggravated by relaxation of crowd and border controls, contact tracing and coronavirus testing.
""Furthermore, some citizens' deteriorating compliance with the minimum health standard due to pandemic fatigue and/or the failure of LGUs to monitor and enforce GCQ (general community quarantine) regulations have also contributed to spikes, especially in metropolitan areas,"" the analysts said, stressing the importance of discipline in observing minimum health standards set by government.
""We also exhort the national and local governments to strictly monitor and enforce compliance with minimum health standards, such as physical distancing, wearing of face mask and face shields and proper hygiene, and to discourage large gatherings to reverse the increase in transmissions at the community level.""
The OCTA called on national government to enhance the capacity of the Philippine healthcare system, such as boosting manpower, increasing hospital equipment, and building more isolation facilities as the country sets to further reopen its economy and relax more restrictions placed to contain COVID-19 transmission.
The group also recommended government's re-evaluation of protocols for international travelers entering the Philippines.
""While we recognize the need to lift the travel ban and allow returning overseas Filipinos (ROFs) and foreign travelers to travel to the country, it is also apparent that there has been some level of ineffectiveness in the implementation of these protocols, or that perhaps we need to recalibrate some of our guidelines for the testing and quarantine of International travelers,"" the analysts advised.
""The fact that SARS-Cov2 variants of foreign origin have entered our country supports this call for stricter guidelines and/or stricter implementation of the existing guidelines.""
The OCTA spurred health workers and other frontliners in Metro Manila and other regions to get vaccinated against the infectious pathogen, as the group projects another surge of COVID-19 cases in the next few weeks.
The Philippines began its vaccination rollout on Monday after receiving its first supply of COVID-19 vaccines, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 doses from Beijing-based drugmaker Sinovac Biotech, on Sunday.

MANILA - The initial batch of around 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine secured for private sector's use is expected to arrive by the second quarter, a presidential adviser said Friday.Sec. Joey Concepcion, founder of Go Negosyo and Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship, said the first batch of vaccines for 23 companies may arrive by May or June. The remaining balance will arrive around the third quarter.
“Kalahati nun dinonate namin sa national government para sa mga medical frontliners,” said Concepcion.
(Half of that we will donate to the national government for our medical frontliners.)

Concepcion said they are also helping secure COVID-19 vaccines from Novavax.
“Kumukuha kami ngayon ng order at dito, ang distributor ay Faberco at Unilab. Dadating 'yan ng third quarter,” Concepcion said.
(We're ordering now and the distributor is Faberco and Unilab. It will arrive by the third quarter.)
He said the national government and the local government units have placed around 30 million to 40 million doses.For the private sector, he said they have already ordered close to 1 million doses.
“Maraming companies are ordering but smaller quantities. These are small and medium size companies halos 400 companies. Dito sa Moderna at Novavax hindi na kailangang mag donate sa government ng vaccines,” he said.
(For Moderna and Novavax, we don't have to donate vaccines to government.)
Small businesses urged to pool orders for COVID-19 vaccine for employees
In an interview on TeleRadyo on Friday, Concepcion said that companies will provide the vaccines to their employees for free.
“All the vaccines are to be given free to our employees, that’s very clear. Libre lahat yan pero yung mga empleyado pwedeng bumili para sa pamilya nila from the company,” he said.
(That's free but the employee can buy for his family from the company.)
He clarified that this is not mandatory as families have the option to wait for the free supply of vaccines coming from their respective local government units.Some companies may extend the free vaccines to their employees’ immediate family while others could offer it through salary deduction.
AstraZeneca, he said, is about $10 for two doses.

According to Olivarez, they have ordered and given a downpayment for 200,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
In a previous interview, Olivarez said the AstraZeneca vaccines will arrive in the late in the second quarter of 2021.
""Meron na rin tayong negotiation sa Moderna, Pfizer, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson,"" Olivarez said in a press conference Tuesday, where they unveiled their pro basketball teams.
""Lahat, i-inoculate natin. Walang maiiwan dito, at ipa-priority natin ang ating mga athletes,"" he guaranteed.

Dado Ruvic, Reuters/FileMANILA— The Philippines this week will get its second delivery of COVID-19 shots through the vaccine-sharing COVAX Facility, Malacañang said on Wednesday.The country will receive 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 4, ""as part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX facility,"" said Palace spokesman Harry Roque.""AstraZeneca’s expected time of arrival is based on the scheduled handover of vaccines. We will notify everyone, if and when there is a change of schedule,"" he said in a statement.
The President will welcome the arrival of the vaccines in person, Roque earlier said.
But vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said he ""cannot confirm yet"" the arrival of the AstraZeneca doses.""Dalawang beses na kami nakuryente diyan. Mabuti i-confirm 'pag may plane nang lumipad from Belgium,"" reasoned Galvez, a former military general who is also chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.
(We have gotten wrong information about that twice.)The reason for contradicting information between the two Palace officials remains unclear.Government's earlier announcement of the supposed arrival of AstraZeneca shots on Monday did not push through over logistics issues.
The lack of an indemnity deal, meanwhile, has delayed the arrival of 117,000 Pfizer COVID-19 shots, which the COVAX Facility was initially expected to send in mid-February.
The Philippines on Sunday received its first vaccine supply, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 COVID-19 jabs from Beijing-based drug maker Sinovac Biotech.The World Health Organization's Representative in the Philippines, Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, had confirmed that around 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, which the Philippine drug regulator already approved for emergency use, have been earmarked for the country under the COVAX Facility.
Some 17 million doses of the product, which the WHO listed for emergency use, have been procured as well by firms and local governments, according to presidential adviser for entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion.
AstraZeneca said it believed its vaccine could protect against severe disease, given that the neutralizing antibody activity was equivalent to that of other COVID-19 vaccines that have demonstrated protection against severe disease.
It noted though early last month that based on early data from a trial, its product appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the South African variant of COVID-19.

Mark Demayo, ABS-CBN News
MANILA - As the Philippines received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines last Sunday, President Rodrigo Duterte provided a somber forecast on when the country could expect to go back to normal life.
""Early in the first, maybe first or second quarter of year '23, 2023, baka, tulong ng Diyos (maybe with the help of God),” Duterte said when asked about the when the Philippines could return to normalcy.Small business owners, eager for the economy and their earnings to return to normal, were confused by the forecast.
Isabel Sabio runs a canteen in Quezon City. She was forced to cut her staff in half because of weak sales during the pandemic.Even now, she only earns enough to pay her staff, her rent, and her other expenses.“Tiyaga lang kasi hinihintay namin maging normal,” Sabio said.(We carry on because we're waiting for things to go back to normal.)
When Sabio heard the President only expects things to return to normal in 2023, she balked.""Parang ang tagal naman. Di ba may vaccine na ngayon? Parang ang ine-expect ko na malapit na. Eh bakit ang tagal pa?,"" Sabio said.(That seems too distant. Isn't there already a vaccine? I'm expecting that it will be soon. Why will it take that long?)
Melda Serrano, who owns an agricultural store in Manila, also said 2023 was too far away a target for a return to normalcy.""Ay, masyado pong mahaba kung ganyan,"" Serrano said.
(That's too long.)
Serrano been getting by with online sales, but she was still forced to reduce the salaries of her workers.""Dapat po by this year ma-ano na po, para makaahon ahon ang ekonomiya ng Pilipinas.”(They should do it this year so that the Philippine economy can recover.)
Gilbert Sangalang, who runs a sounds and lights store in Manila, meanwhile gives a more generous interpretation of Duterte's statement.""Sa ngayon kasi, medyo bukas na halos lahat diba? Baka 2022 OK na yan, 23 mas OK na tayo. Baka sinasabi ng Pangulo, yun na yung pinaka da best natin, 23.”(Right now, almost everything is open, right? Maybe 2022 it's going to be OK. 2023 will be more OK. Maybe what the President is saying is that the best will be in 2023.)
Sangalang was forced to lay off workers and plead with his landlord for an extension on his rent.He also believes the vaccination program should speed up the return to normalcy.“Malaking tulong yan. Wala pa ngang bakuna, excited na tayo dumating yung mga yon eh. Ngayong dumating na, kailangan magpaturok, kailangan natin para bumalik yung dati,"" Sangalang said.(That's a big help. We were already excited when the vaccines had yet to arrive. Now that they're here, we need to get jabbed, we need this to go back to how things were before.)
An economist meanwhile has criticized Duterte's 2023 target, saying the President was ""setting the bar too low"" and warned that the Chief Executive's statement will also damage and delay the country's economic recovery.
Last year, the Philippines suffered its worst economic contraction since the end of World War 2. Economists expect the recession to extend to the first three months of 2021.
The Philippines is the last country in Southeast Asia to receive COVID-19 vaccines.A shipment of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China arrived on Sunday.Another shipment from British drugmaker AstraZeneca was supposed to arrive last Monday, but the delivery was postponed indefinitely, officials said.

MAYNILA - Umarangkada na ang COVID-19 vaccine rollout ng iba pang lungsod sa Metro Manila kasabay ng pagdating ng Sinovac vaccines mula China.Ito ay ilang araw matapos dumating ang nasa 600,000 doses ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 mula sa Sinovac ng bansang China na donasyon ng kanilang pamahalaan.Nagsimula na ang COVID-19 vaccination program ng lokal na pamahalaan ng Maynila sa Sta. Ana Hospital, kung saan 200 health workers ang inaasahang magpapabakuna.Unang naturukan si Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna na isang doktor. Naturukan din ang pinuno ng City Health Office at Sta. Ana Hospital.Aabot naman sa 153 ang target bakunahan sa Pasig City General Hospital at Pasig City Children’s Hospital sa pag-arangkada ng vaccination program sa lungsod.
Si Dr. Nerissa Sabarre, head ng COVID-19 referral facility ng Pasig City Children’s Hospital, ang unang nabakunahan sa “symbolic” na vaccination ceremony ng lungsod.Wala namang naramdamang adverse effects ang mga nabakunahan sa ngayon.“Okay, I didn't feel anything, halos wala akong naramdaman. I feel very good, I feel well,” ayon kay Dr. Noel Cruz, doktor sa Pasig City General Hospital.Nagpasalamat naman si Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto sa health care workers sa kanilang sakripisyo ngayong COVID-19 pandemic.""Iyong pagsuot ng PPE sa emergency room nang 7 to 8 hours lahat po 'yan, kayo po ang nakaranas niyan. Hindi naman kami, kaming politiko 'pag gusto naming umupo, puwede kaming umupo. Pagod din naman kami pero nakakapagpahinga kami hindi gaya ng health care professionals natin na talagang minsan walang pahinga,"" ani Sotto.Sa Pasay City General Hospital naman, tinatayang nasa 100 health care workers ang matuturukan ng Sinovac vaccines. Aabot sa 300 doses ng bakuna mula sa Department of Health storage facility sa Marikina ang dumating sa ospital gabi ng Lunes.
Pero kasabay nito, may ilan umanong mga medical frontliner ang umatras sa pagpapabakuna dahil sa napapaulat na mababang efficacy rate nito.Ayon kay Imelda Mateo, chief ng Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center sa Marikina, kaunti lang mula sa mga nag-pre-register na frontliner sa pagpapabakuna ang sumipot sa pagsisimula ng kanilang inoculation drive sa mega vaccination center ng lungsod ngayong Martes.Aniya, 120 lang ang sumipot mula sa 1,200 na pumirma at nagbigay ng consent na mabakunahan sila noong panahon na ang inaasahang bakuna ay Pfizer o AstraZeneca mula sa COVAX facility ng World Health Organization.
Pero noong malaman na Sinovac ang unang ibibigay ay nagsiatrasan umano ang karamihan. Aniya, hindi naman daw sila nagkulang sa pagbibigay ng impormasyon tungkol sa bakuna.
""It’s equivalent to the other brands so 'yun ang motive natin. Ma-prevent at ma-down 'yung chance na ma-confine, 'yung probability of severe incubation, sometimes death,"" ani Mateo.Ayon kay Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, aabot sa 749 health workers na ang nabakunahan mula nang magsimula ang vaccine rollout noong Lunes. Aniya, inaasahan nila na dadami pa ang frontliner na magpapabakuna sa mga darating na araw.
""Hindi masasabi na 100 percent na walang agam-agam. Makikita natin sa darating na araw. Titingnan natin in the coming days,"" ani Vergeire.
Nabanggit naman ng gobyerno na mananatili pa ring prayoridad ang mga frontliner kahit pa man hindi nila piliin na magpaturok ng Sinovac vaccines.Noong Lunes, Marso 1, nagsimula sa vaccine rollout ang Pilipinas, na nahuhuli na kung ikukumpara sa mga karatig-lugar sa Southeast Asia pagdating sa pagpapabakuna kontra COVID-19. Target ng gobyerno na mabakunahan ang nasa 70 milyong katao sa populasyon ng bansa.
Bukod sa 600,000 doses ng Sinovac na donasyon ng China sa Pilipinas, inaasahan ang pagdating ng Astrazeneca at Pfizer vaccines na mula sa COVAX facility ng World Health Organization. Naantala ito dahil sa hinihinging indemnification deal, kung saan gobyerno ang sasagot ng gastusin kung sakaling may mga makaranas ng side effects dahil sa turok.-- Mga ulat nina Adrian Ayalin, Jeck Batallones, at Arra Perez, ABS-CBN News",abscbn

MANILA - A total of 756 people received their COVID-19 vaccine on the country's first day of inoculation, which was ""quite satisfactory,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Tuesday.
The Philippines received its first legal coronavirus shots from China's Sinovac Biotech on Sunday and began inoculating some frontline workers and a handful of officials on Monday.

""Yesterday’s rollout was quite satisfactory and there was much pride and joy in seeing that at long last, the health care workers had started to receive their vaccination, protection against COVID-19. It was really quite heartwarming to witness the historic event,"" Duque told ANC's Headstart.
""The total was 756 as of last reporting period yesterday,"" he said when asked how many were inoculated.

Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the Philippine General Hospital, received the first authorized COVID-19 vaccine shot.Meet Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the first to be officially vaccinated against COVID-19 in PH
Food and Drug Administration Director-General Eric Domingo and Dr. Edsel Salvana, who is part of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group and also a PGH doctor, were also among the first to be inoculated.
Vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr. and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos, Jr. were also vaccinated at the PGH.
Duque, although present at different ceremonies on Monday, did not receive the vaccine as he was 64 years old. The emergency use authorization granted to the Sinovac vaccine states that it can only be administered to those aged 18 to 59.

The 600,000 doses from Sinovac that were donated by the Chinese government will be used for 300,000 people, said Duque. These shots will be deployed to different hospitals across the country, with about 12 hospitals expected to hold simultaneous vaccinations on Tuesday.
""We’re deploying to as many healthcare facilities as we can, but remember that we have only less than 20 percent of the total required doses of about 3.4 million needed to inoculate about 1.7 million health care workers,"" he said.
He also called on health workers to get themselves immunized with the vaccine currently available, as the government tries its best to get more brands into the country.
""I beg our health care workers: magpabakuna na po tayo. Wag na po tayong magduda o mag-alinlangan, magkaroon ng agam-agam dahil ang pinakamagandang bakuna po ay yung andito na,"" he said.
""Iisang klase pa lang po ito. Ginagawa ng inyong gobyerno, nagpupunyagi na talagang makapasok ang anim pang mga bakuna na atin pong aangkatin,"" he added.
(I beg of our health care workers: let us please get ourselves vaccinated. Let's not doubt or waver, have hesitations because the best vaccine is what's here. This is only one kind. Your government is striving to import 6 more vaccines.)
The FDA initially said the Sinovac vaccine was not recommended for health workers who were exposed to COVID-19 patients, but the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) later cleared its use despite the regulator's earlier reservations.
Vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca have earlier been given emergency use authorization as well. The Philippines had been expecting coronavirus shots from these brands from the COVAX facility, but these had been delayed.

The vaccination program will be crucial for Philippine efforts to revive its economy, which suffered a record 9.5 percent slump last year due to strict and lengthy lockdowns that hit consumer spending and saw big job losses.

MANILA — The OCTA Group on Monday said it is seeing a continued increase in COVID-19 cases in some parts of the National Capital Region (NCR), which may push the country's total to 665,000 by the end of the month.
This as the country finally started its rollout of COVID-19 vaccines using donations from China.

In a written report, professors from the University of the Philippines and the University of Santo Tomas who comprise the research group said that the NCR averaged 942 daily cases in the last 4 days.
“Before tumaas, nag-average tayo ng 400 cases per day sa Metro Manila. Ngayon, for the past 4 days, ang average natin 900. So, dumoble or more pa nga,"" Dr. Guido David, an OCTA Fellow, told ABS-CBN in a video call.
""Mabilis itong pagtaas ng cases,” he noted.(Before the increase in cases, we were averaging 400 cases per day in Metro Manila. Now, for the past 4 days, our average doubled to 900. The increase is fast.)
The OCTA Group bases its analysis on the R naught or reproduction number of COVID-19. A reproduction number of more than 1 means that the infection is spreading to more people since one infected person can infect one or more people.
The group said the reproduction number for NCR, home to roughly a tenth of the country's a little over 100 million population, increased to 1.5.
Asked what could be the cause of the spike in cases, David said, “Meron kaming strong suspicion na ito (UK variant) yung nagda-drive ng transmission sa mga areas na 'yan.”
(We have a strong suspicion that the UK variant is driving the transmission in those areas.)
The UK variant, which has been detected in the Philippines, is said to be more transmissible. So far, 62 cases of such variant have been recorded in the country.
David said the rise in COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila follows a pattern similar to that of Cebu City and Mountain Province, where the UK variant was detected.
The NCR cities that recorded “steep upward trends” are Pasay, Quezon, Manila, Makati, Malabon, Taguig, Paranaque and Navotas.
The OCTA Group said Valenzuela, Caloocan and Las Pinas had a smaller increase in new cases.
Among cities, Cebu City still has the most number of new cases per day at around 200. Other cities outside Metro Manila included in the Top 10 areas reporting the most number of new cases are Lapu-Lapu, Davao and Mandaue.
“Under the current trend, the number of new COVID-19 cases per day (for NCR) will increase from its current average daily value of 770 to 2,200 by the end of March 2021,” the OCTA Group said.
The country is expected to reach 665,000 total cases and 14,000 total deaths if the Philippines is unable to curb the spread of the disease.
As of Monday, the country's total infections stood at 578,381, including 12,322 deaths.
Over the weekend, the ABS-CBN Data Analytics pointed out the almost 8% positivity rate in the country, with NCR and Region 7 also showing a surge.

David said that with the continued increase in cases, Filipinos should strictly follow health protocols such as the wearing of masks and physical distancing.“Itong vaccine rollout, hindi natin makikita ang effects nito sa number of cases,” he said. “Sa ibang countries, nakapag-vaccinate sila ng 20% of the population bago nakakita ng decrease of cases.”
(We won’t see the effects of the vaccine rollout in the number of cases for now… In other countries, they only saw a decrease in cases when they vaccinated 20% of their population.)
The government aims to vaccinate 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year, depending on the supply of vaccines, to achieve herd immunity against the virus.

MANILA — The Philippines has started its vaccination program with jabs from Beijing-based drug maker Sinovac Biotech on Monday, in hopes of an immediate return to normalcy as the country races to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).This year, the country aims to inoculate 70 million of its 108 million people to achieve herd immunity and reopen an economy that in 2020 saw its worst contraction on record, due largely to tight restrictions on movement in place since mid-March.

From the RITM, the vaccines will then be moved to regional warehouses and from there, they will again be to transported to local government units (LGUs).It will then be the responsibility of the LGUs to allocate the vaccines to hospitals and vaccination sites where the vaccines will be administered.

MANILA - The chief of the country's top tertiary hospital has become the symbol of Philippines' fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, being the first recipient of the vaccine from Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac.Dr. Gerardo Dizon Legaspi, the director of the Philippine General Hospital, was the first health worker to be officially vaccinated, as the Philippines launched its vaccine drive Monday.The neurosurgeon's inoculation officially marks the start of the vaccination program in the Philippines, where over half a million people already contracted the disease.Here are some details about the health frontliner, according to medical websites:- Dr. Gerardo Dizon Legaspi “Dr. Gap” has decades of active practice and teaching in neurosurgery;
- Expertise includes treating Aneurysms, Vestibular Schwannomas, Pituitary Adenomas, Skull Base Surgery, Keyhole and Endoscopic Surgery;
- Has clinics in Philippine General Hospital, Medical City, and St. Luke's Global City;
- Diplomate, Philippine Board of Neurological Surgeons; Fellow, Academy of Filipino Neurosurgeons and at the Philippine College of Surgeons
- Worked as a consultant in other government institutions, like Philippine Children's Medical Center, AFP Medical Center and Davao Regional Hospital in Tagum, Davao del Norte.

The Philippines began its first legal vaccination on Monday, beginning an ambitious program that seeks to inoculate up to 70 million people or two-thirds of the population this year.After Legaspi, also vaccinated were Dr. Edsel Salvana, who is part of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group and also a PGH doctor, and Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo.
Authorities earlier said China would donate 600,000 COVID-19 shots through Beijing-based Sinovac, which received its emergency use authorization in the Philippines just last week.
The 2-shot vaccine delivery will be enough to cover 50,000 soldiers and 250,000 health workers, who are at the top of the priority list, President Rodrigo Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque earlier said. ",abscbn

MANILA (UPDATE) — Philippine General Hospital (PGH) head Gerardo Legaspi on Monday received the first authorized dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines, just several hours after a batch of donated doses from the Chinese company Sinovac arrived in the country.
In a live feed of the vaccination via PTV, Legaspi received the CoronaVac jab from PGH nurse Chareluck Santos.
After being inoculated, he presented a certificate showing that he received the vaccine.

""Ang asawa ko po at anak, kinausap ko kahapon dahil hyper-allergic sila, malamang itong bakuna ang i-recommend ko sa kanila,"" Legaspi said during a briefing after he was vaccinated.
(I talked to my wife and child yesterday, and because they are hyper-allergic, I might recommend this for them.)
Meet Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the first to be officially vaccinated against COVID-19 in PH
The vaccine developed by Sinovac is said to have only common vaccine side effects. No adverse or serious side effects or allergic reactions have been observed among those vaccinated with it.
Second to be vaccinated is Dr. Edsel Salvana, who is part of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group and also a PGH doctor.
Next in line was Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo.

Legaspi and the other vaccine recipients were monitored for 30 minutes for possible side effects.
Also vaccinated at the PGH were Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos, Jr. and vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque was also seen being screened for the Sinovac vaccine. But the tight supply of the shots prevented him from getting inoculated.
""Ako po, willing mabakunahan. Kaya lang, kagaya ng sinabi ni [PGH Director] Dr. Gap Legaspi ay ubos na iyong 100 [doses] nila for the day ‘no. We will have to come back on another day,"" Roque told reporters in an online briefing.
(I am wiling to get vaccinated. But, as Dr. Gap Legaspi said, their 100-dose allocation for the day has been used up.)
During his speech before the vaccination, Galvez said that while there are other vaccines with higher efficacy rate, “There is no such best vaccine dahil ang pinaka-best vaccine ay yung effective at efficient na dumarating ng mas maaga.”
(There is no such best vaccine because the best vaccine is the one that is effective and efficient that arrived earlier.)
PGH spokesman Dr. Jonas Del Rosario, who was earlier reported to be the first to receive the shot, said he was not vaccinated after latest tests showed he had a high amount of antibodies after recovering from COVID-19 last year.
He said he expects more health workers to get inoculated after 90 percent of PGH workers said they preferred a different vaccine.The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian country to receive initial vaccine supplies, fueling concerns over recovery prospects for a consumption-driven economy that suffered its worst slump on record last year due to the lengthy coronavirus lockdowns.A total of 1,200 doses were sent to the PGH on Monday after the Chinese company’s vaccines arrived in the country on Sunday.
Sinovac has an efficacy rate of 65.3% to 91.2%, based on vaccinations in Indonesia and Turkey. But its efficacy rate among health workers exposed to COVID-19 in Brazil was only 50.4%.While this is above the World Health Organization benchmark of 50%, it is significantly lower than other vaccine frontrunners like Pfizer and Moderna with 95% efficacy.
The Philippines has issued emergency use authorization for Sinovac, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Pfizer was supposed to be the first COVID-19 vaccine with an EUA to arrive in the Philippines, but it was delayed due to the indemnification agreement requirement.
There have been reports of smuggled COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines. Last year, members of the Presidential Security Group were inoculated using the vaccine candidate of another Chinese drugmaker, Sinopharm.

Galvez said he was personally instructed by President Rodrigo Duterte to be vaccinated at the PGH to address the low confidence of health workers towards Sinovac.
“Kahapon, binigyan niya (Duterte) ako ng utos na 'Magpabakuna ka para at least it will make them (health workers) feel na ang ating pamahalaan, ang lahat ng mga bakuna na inaangkat natin ay safe and effective',” said Galvez, a retired military general.
(Yesterday, he ordered me to be vaccinated so at least it will make health workers feel that our government is importing vaccines that are safe and effective.)
Health workers are first in line in the Philippines’ priority recipients of COVID-19 vaccines.
LIST: Sub-groups in COVID-19 vaccination priority
Surveys from different hospitals showed high confidence in the vaccines against the coronavirus.l But some reports, like that of PGH, showed a much lower rate of health workers willing to be vaccinated with Sinovac’s vaccine.
Galvez said that while efficacy rate in preventing COVID-19 may only be at 50%, there is 100% protection against severe illness and death.
Other hospitals that received vials of the Sinovac vaccine were military hospital V. Luna Medical Center; Dr. Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Tala, Caloocan; the Pasig City General Hospital; the Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame; and the Lung Center of the Philippines.Of the 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines, 100,000 are supposed to be allocated for the Department of National Defense (DND).
In a statement, the DND said it will initially inoculate 14,520 individuals using 29,040 doses, and the remaining 70,960 doses will be given to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
The government aims to vaccinate 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year, depending on the supply of vaccines.
Expected to arrive next are doses from AstraZeneca through the COVAX Facility, which aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.

Besides the donated doses, the Philippines is also expected to procure vaccines from Sinovac.

The Philippines in March will get 1 million more Sinovac shots, and 3.5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine fro Britain's AstraZeneca, said Galvez.Doses that will not be used by health workers would go to essential government workers like barangay emergency response teams, and ""influencers"" like mayors who could boost vaccine confidence, he said.
The Philippines has seen a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some areas like several cities in Metro Manila. Currently, there are a total of 578,381 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country, of which, 31,708 or 5.5 percent are active infections.
PH reports over 2,000 new COVID-19 cases for 5th straight day, as vaccination starts
Besides the increase in cases in some areas, the Philippines is also monitoring the possible spread of new COVID-19 variants of concern, some of which are said to be more transmissible.
The Philippines' first COVID-19 case was reported on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.

Reports of smuggled doses and VIP vaccinations have hounded the country's delayed inoculation drive.The government expects the bulk of the country's COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in the third and the fourth quarters of 2021.Shots developed by Sinovac, Pfizer-BioNTech, and AstraZeneca have emergency use authorizations in the Philippines.The country's drug regulator also allowed the ""compassionate use"" of 10,000 doses of Chinese state firm Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine for Duterte's security detail, many of whom received the same product as early as September last year.
COVID-19 vaccines used by PSG were 'smuggled', says defense chief
Columnist Ramon Tulfo, Duterte's former special envoy to China, said he, some Cabinet officials, and a senator also took smuggled Sinopharm jabs.The Philippines, which has recorded 12,289 deaths due to the infectious respiratory disease, logged its first COVID-19 case on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the virus is believed to have first emerged.
The pandemic, which triggered quarantine restrictions in the country beginning March last year, resulted in a -9.5 percent GDP growth for 2020.It is the first contraction since 1998's 0.5 percent decline due to the Asian financial crisis and worse than the 7 percent contraction recorded in 1984, making it the steepest post-war slump in Philippine history, using available PSA data dating back to 1947.

The IATF against COVID-19 should have representatives from local governments, according to the Vice President.
""Sana, pinag-aaralan nang maayos. Yung pinakasusi sa pagbubukas ng economy, ‘yung bakuna, yun ng tutukan natin,"" she added.
(This should be studied well. The key to reopening the economy is the vaccine, we should focus on that.)
The Philippines later Sunday received its first official supply of COVID-19 vaccines, courtesy of China's Sinovac Biotech.
A Chinese military plane carrying the first batch of CoronaVac vaccines landed in Villamor Air Base at around 4 in the afternoon Sunday.

The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to Sinovac's product for public use. But it did not recommend it for health workers exposed to COVID-19 after a Brazil study found it was only 50 percent effective for the said group.
The government's interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and the health department's Technical Advisory Group (TAG), however, deemed it ""sufficient to recommend the use of the vaccine for healthcare workers.""

Philippines grants EUA to COVID-19 vaccine of China's Sinovac
FDA: Efficacy ng Sinovac, bumababa sa health workers na mas exposed sa COVID-19
This prompted the DOH to consult the NITAG for its recommendation on how to distribute the vaccine given its lower efficacy among health workers and the current prioritization framework of the government.
“The DOH, the Food and Drug Administration and our panel of experts concurred that current available evidence is enough to establish that the vaccine is safe for use,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a briefing on Friday with members of the NITAG and the DOH Technical Advisory Group (TAG).
“NITAG and the TAG (technical advisory group) has deemed it sufficient to recommend the use of the vaccine for health care workers as it bears to reiterate that our goal for prioritizing health care workers for vaccination is to reduce morbidity and mortality among their group, while they maintain the most critical essential health services,” she added.
Vergeire said the NITAG already presented the recommendation to the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19 response.
“Just this morning we presented to the IATF and we got approval already. This will also be presented to the President,” she said.This approval “is an assurance that the use of Sinovac is safe and beneficial to our healthcare workers,” said Palace spokesman Harry Roque.“As we have said in many occasions, healthcare workers are the most critical frontliners in our fight against COVID-19 and they remain at the top of our priority list for vaccination,” Roque said in a statement.“We are confident that many of our healthcare workers would get themselves inoculated to boost public confidence in our mass vaccination program against the coronavirus,” he added.Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine will be the first to be rolled out in the Philippines. First in line are health workers in COVID-dedicated hospitals. Vergeire said they are still finalizing which hospitals will receive the jabs.
ALLOWED TO WAIT
The DOH and its advisory groups said that health workers may decline or choose to wait for another vaccine. It won’t affect their priority status.
However, Dr. Nina Castillo-Carandang said the health workers’ readiness to accept COVID-19 vaccines is expected to affect vaccine confidence among the general public.
“If health care workers are reluctant to accept vaccination then that also sends a signal to the general public. We'd like to offer this opportunity for health care workers, if they're willing to do so to have themselves vaccinated with Sinovac,” she said.
Castillo-Carandang said that while health workers may wait for another brand, there is no assurance when the next one would arrive.
Health workers have expressed concern over the reported low efficacy rate of the Sinovac vaccine.
SAFE VACCINE
Dr. Maria Consorcia Quizon, another NITAG member, said Sinovac is a “safe vaccine.”
“[Sinovac] is safe for use for health care workers. We need to protect them. Since ito ang available ngayon, kailangan nating gamitin para sa kanila (Since this is the one available now, then we must use it for them),” Quizon said.
Vergeire pointed out that safety and efficacy are measured separately and that studies have shown that Sinovac’s vaccine is safe.
Dr. John Wong, a member of the DOH TAG, said while the vaccine’s overall efficacy rate for health workers aged 18 to 59 was at around 50%, it has higher efficacy against more severe cases of the disease.
He said for moderate cases, the efficacy was at 72%, and for severe cases it was at 100%.
“If we had this vaccine last year in NCR, we could have averted 42 health worker deaths and averted 3,300 cases,” he said.
The FDA previously said that the vaccine, which used the traditional inactivated virus platform, only results in common vaccination side effects although more time is needed for observation.
Asked if the DOH will still wait for the recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council, an independent advisory group, a member of the NITAG said it is not necessary since the first batch of 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses were donated.
Vergeire said the vaccines of Sinovac that will arrive on Sunday will be in single dose vials and will not require special syringes.

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News.MANILA — Some local chief executives in Metro Manila and in the provinces bared their respective COVID-19 vaccination plans on Wednesday, highlighting the importance of the local governments' preparedness to be able to convince their constituents to be inoculated against the coronavirus.
In a webinar officiated by Liveable Cities Challenge PH and Globe Telecom, Bacolod City Mayor Bing Leonardia said a COVID-19 vaccination council was created in December last year by the city government, among the first LGUs to create such body.
Leonardia said that out of Bacolod’s population of 624,987, the city government aims to vaccinate 424,992 or 68%. Their budget for the program is P300 million.Some 650,000 sure doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine can cover 325,000 individuals or 76% of the target population. The rest will have to wait for another batch of vaccine allocation.
“The down payment was done last Monday that came about after Malacañang allowed us to make that down payment,” Leonardia said.He said the city is heavily dependent on private-public partnership as volunteers would complement the needed vaccination manpower.They aim to vaccinate 13,500 residents per day in the 27 vaccination centers, or up to 20,000 per day if 40 centers are mobilized.“We have established direction towards this,"" he said.
Barangay registration, as well as a vaccine education program, are ongoing in the city.Bacolod City's cold chain facility is also in place, Leonardia said — a 30 sqm cold room, 1 unit of ultra cold storage good for 80,000 doses and portable vaccine storage of 25 units that would be good for 1.6 million doses.“Last February 11, we delivered our vaccination plan. And yesterday (February 23), we were informed by DOH that our vaccination plan is okay. We are set to go ahead with our vaccination plan,” according to the mayor.
Leonardia said they are active in their campaign against COVID-19 despite registering 0 new cases recently.Losing 190 people to the virus, however, was not something to be taken lightly, according to the mayor.
In a webinar by Liveable Cities Challenge PH, Bacolod City Mayor Bing Leonardia of Bacolod City said, their target to be vaccinated is at 424,992 which is 68% of Bacolod's population of 424,992.

WATCH: When will we get vaccinated vs COVID-19? | NXT
QUEZON CITY
In Quezon City, “QC Protektado sa Bakunang Sigurado” is in place, with pre-vaccination phase starting as early as December 3, said Mayor Joy Belmonte.
There are 1,066,000 priority individuals in the city, including frontline workers in health facilities, senior citizens, persons with comorbidities, other essential workers and the indigent population.Both Quezon City and Makati City have ID systems in place that were previously created to monitor the delivery of services to residents during the pandemic. This would now be used to create a master list of individuals to be vaccinated.“Anyone who lives in Quezon City, regardless if they are voters or not, can avail of the Quezon City ID. You can get a QC resident ID or a non-resident ID. Non-resident ID are for those working for and /or studying because we believe that anyone who contributes to the well-being of the progress and development of our city can and should be vaccinated in our city,” Belmonte said.Quezon City rejects reopening cinemas amid pandemic
Over 1M QC residents in priority list for COVID-19 vaccines: Belmonte
There is an ongoing vaccine confidence campaign as well to encourage more people to receive the shots.
“Since we have started, we have started about 160,000 registries on the master list and we are giving ourselves 6 months, considering the size and scope of the city,” she said.Quezon City partnered with Zuellig Pharma for vaccine handling and rollout.Zuellig will be the one to provide cold storage to Quezon City, but the city will invest on storage when the supplies arrive in vaccination centers.A total of 1.1 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine is being targeted, for a budget of P5 billion, but only more than 500,000 doses have been committed to the city.
“We are still in the process of negotiating with other pharmaceuticals,” Belmonte said.Talks with dioceses are also underway to tap on parishes to serve as additional inoculation areas aside from the already-set 24 sites.
The city has also partnered with hospitals for manpower needs. About 1,200 personnel will be mobilized per an 8 hour shift to conduct vaccinations.
“The Ateneo offered to become our mega-vaccination center,” Belmonte said.
In Quezon City, she pointed out, they have to vaccinate 1.6 million in 6 to 8 months. Some 80% of its residents are above 15 years old, she noted.
For the post-vaccination stage, there will be monitoring of people vaccinated.
QC hotline 122 can be utilized for queries pertaining to the vaccine, and barangay health and other trained workers will monitor and can conduct home visits.
“Every patient will receive a message to tell them when, where, and what time they will be vaccinated... Our goal is to achieve a herd immunity, which is 80% of our population,” Belmonte said.“Most of the people who are undecided or do not want are because they are just afraid, they lack information. That's why our communications plan at present is tailor-fitted to answer the fear of our people,” she added.MAKATI CITYMeanwhile, in Makati City, Mayor Abby Binay said that an initial budget of P1.6 billion has been allotted for its vaccination program, which will also cover business owners and their employees working in the city.
“This program is our way of helping our economic frontliners,” Binay said.The city will have 32 vaccination sites and 104 vaccination teams.
An estimated 500,000 will be vaccinated.Makati firms' employees included in free vaccination program: mayor
“We have converted the Makati coliseum into a mega-vaccination site,” Binay said.There is an online registration for Bakuna Makati. Screening and counseling will be done online.
The Makatizens ID system will be the city’s database in creating the vaccine recipients master list.
The target is to have 11,000 people vaccinated daily, or totally cover the target population in a span of 60-90 days.
“The registration also includes screening, so we can’t launch it too early because some are time-bound, like information of latest vaccine administered, etcetera,” Binay said.“In 2017, we have launched our Makatizens card. So we already have our database plus our voters records. So, we are backtracking for our master list, how many will register,” she added.ORMOC CITYMayor Richard Gomez of Ormoc City said that vaccine access can be challenging in his area of responsibility because while it has a relatively small population, its land area is similar to the size of Metro Manila.
The estimated number of people to be vaccinated in the city is 131,879, out of the city’s more than 240,000 population. They will be divided in 6 districts and would be inoculated through the city's 80 vaccination sites.
Gomez said they would rely on private-public partnership for the vaccination drive, which they target to complete in 14 days.
A private company will handle the logistics for vaccines in Ormoc City.
“Our main storage will be at the Ormoc City Superdome,” Gomez said.
Plans are also in place to convince others who are not yet decided to be vaccinated, as well as for proper disposal of the vaccination waste.
""For the succeeding year, we have set aside budget to make vaccination free since our population is not that big,"" Gomez said.“Since the pandemic started, we have created our QR code system. Anywhere in Ormoc that you go, we supplied about 9,000 plus scanners all over the city. It’s an all-in-one thing. Our COVID registration is here. We are more than 90% done with our registration. We are just waiting for the questionnaires from the Department of Health,” he said.
“Those who were not able to register in our QR code system, their barangay workers wlil go to do house-to-house to get them registered,” he added.Meanwhile, Margaret Bengzon, Senior Health Consultant of the Ayala Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (AC Health), said the private sector is already augmenting the needs of local government units.Bengzon said the benefits of public-private partnership are ""accelerated execution, reduced financial burden, getting more lives saved and leading faster recovery of economic forces.""“The Ayala Group and other private sector partners have been supporting the National Vaccine Deployment Program across various workstreams. IT systems, funding & budget, legal/regulatory & policy, vaccine evaluation,” she said.“AC Health will augment the efforts of our local government hosts. We can deliver as close to an end-to-end vaccination program,” she added.Malacañang said on Thursday that the Philippines would get its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines this weekend, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 doses from Sinovac.
The Philippines, which has Southeast Asia's second highest COVID-19 cases, has lagged behind its regional neighbors in launching its vaccination drive.
The government aims to vaccinate up to 70 million or two-thirds of the population this year.

MANILA — The public should ask officials leading the country's COVID-19 response why the government has to offer deploying more nurses to Britain to get coronavirus vaccines, a senator said on Thursday, as the Philippine immunization drive lagged.Malacañang on Wednesday backed the labor department's statement that the Philippines was open to lifting the cap on health workers' overseas deployment in exchange for vaccines from Britain and Germany, which it would use to inoculate outbound workers and hundreds of thousands of Filipino repatriates.While Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III and Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, who initiated the offer, are ""very good people,"" Sen. Joel Villanueva said he disagreed with trading Filipino nurses for COVID-19 shots.""I don't think they are worth it na pag-usapan sa ganito. But more than anything, I think the bigger question here is bakit tayo humantong sa ganitong pagkakataon na tila baga parang you know, short of bartering our human resources for COVID vaccines,"" he said.
(I don't think they are worth so low that we should talk about them like this, but I think the bigger question here is why did come this, that it seems we are short of bartering our human resources for COVID vaccines.)
""Importanteng matanong natin iyan sa ating mga sarili, lalong-lalo na sa IATF (inter-agency task force on COVID-19) o doon sa mga nangangalaga nitong ating vaccination,"" the senator added in a televised public briefing.(It is important that we ask that to ourselves, especially to the IATF and those taking care of our vaccination.)The Philippines has not yet receive any vaccine shipment, with which it hopes to inoculate up to 70 million people or about two-thirds of its population this year.Video courtesy of PTV
A delay in the emergency use authorization of COVID-19 shots from China's Sinovac Biotech had pushed back their arrival initially set on Feb. 23.
The lack of an indemnity deal, which settles who should pay in case of adverse vaccine effects, delayed the arrival of 117,000 Pfizer doses through the vaccine-sharing COVAX Facility.
In the Senate's ""marathon hearings"" for the government's vaccination program, lawmakers never heard that an indemnification fund would be the ""end-all, be-all"" and ""deal breaker"" of the Pfizer jabs, said Villanueva.Congress, he said, has passed a bill creating a vaccine indemnification system. Duterte will sign the measure immediately after his office receives it, his spokesman Harry Roque said on Thursday.In backing the nurses-for-vaccines offer on Wednesday, Roque had said that while the Philippines has ordered enough vaccines for its adult population, ""Siyempre kung mas maraming supply pa ang makukuha natin, bakit hindi?""(Of course, if we can get more supplies, why not?)""Wini-welcome din natin [ito] because more is better than less,"" he told reporters.
(We welcome this because more is better than less.)
The Philippines earlier relaxed a ban on deploying its health care workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year.The proposal to provide more Filipino nurses to Europe in exchange for COVID-19 vaccines is ""insensitive and dehumanizing,"" said former vice president Jejomar Binay.""Our nurses are not commodities to be traded,"" Binay, also former presidential adviser on OFW affairs, said in a statement.Nurses are among the millions of Filipinos who work overseas, providing in excess of $30 billion a year in remittances vital to the country's economy. In 2019, almost 17,000 Filipino nurses signed overseas work contracts, government data showed.
Britain said there were 11,000 more nurses working in the National Health Service than last year. It said that while it was grateful to the 30,000 Filipinos working for the NHS, Britain did not need to trade vaccines for more.
""We have no plans for the UK to agree to a vaccine deal with the Philippines linked to further recruitment of nurses,"" a health ministry spokeswoman said, citing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to share spare shots later in the year.
""We have confirmed that we will share any surplus vaccines in the future - for example through the COVAX international procurement pool.""
Calls to Germany's mission in Manila went unanswered.
Britain and Germany have inoculated a combined 23 million people.While Filipino nurses have fought to lift the deployment ban to escape poor working conditions and low pay at home, the workers-for-vaccine plan has not gone down well with some medical workers.

But it was delayed because, according to him, China wanted the Philippines to grant it first an EUA, which it got only on Feb. 22.Philippine authorities are assessing which of the priority sectors in the country's vaccination program will receive the 500,000 doses of Sinovac's vaccine, after the country's Food and Drug Administration noted that the product yielded a low efficacy rate of 50.4% when used on health care workers exposed to COVID-19 during its trial.

The lack of an indemnity deal, which settles the question of who should pay in case of adverse effects from the vaccine, had delayed the arrival of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine under the COVAX Facility, initially expected in mid-February.""Ang huling nakalap ko po ay mayroon na lang kaunti pang pinababago doon sa indemnity agreement,"" said Roque.""Pero sa akin nga po, as far as the President is concerned, tuloy na po ang pagbabakuna using Sinovac.""

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte's special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo said he has applied to be a Philippine distributor of Sinopharm vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by a Chinese government-owned pharmaceutical company.
In his column on Manila Times on Saturday, Tulfo also revealed that he was inoculated with Sinopharm's vaccine last year, along with other officials whose names he withheld.
""I now confess to the public: I had myself vaccinated — along with some government officials whose names I won’t mention here — with the Sinopharm vaccine last October. Some members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) were also injected with the same vaccine,"" Tulfo said.
Tulfo said he ""risked his life"" to have himself inoculated with the Sinopharm vaccine because he applied to be a local distributor.""That’s another confession: I have applied to be one of the distributors of the Sinopharm vaccine in the country, that’s why I risked my life to have myself inoculated ahead of the public,"" he added.
He also said Duterte expressed interest in having himself inoculated but was advised against doing so to avoid controversy.
The country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to approve for emergency use Sinopharm's vaccine.
As a Philippine government official, there is perceived a conflict of interest in Tulfo's application as a Philippine distributor of the Chinese vaccine.
Duterte said earlier he prefers to take shots from Sinopharm.
""He has said na (that) his preference is for Sinopharm,"" said Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque on Monday.Some members of the President's security detail took unauthorized Sinopharm jabs last year.Earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration issued a ""compassionate use license"" for the Presidential Security Group to take 10,000 Sinopharm jabs.PSG gets go signal to use COVID-19 shots months after some members got unauthorized jabs

“What we're still getting from the ground is that a lot of them are afraid to go to the health centers because they're afraid for the safety of them and their kids. Baka makakuha sila ng (They might get infected with) COVID, so they're not going to the centers,” Ho said during a media briefing.
“We want to reassure everyone that as long as we're able to practice our minimum public health standards - there are protocols in place in health center, so that the mother and the baby are protected,” she added, explaining that they would only need to stay in the health center for 15 minutes during the vaccination.
The DOH and participating local government units are holding a mass immunization campaign for the whole month of February to prevent another measles outbreak from happening, and to further stop the spread of polio.
PH to hold measles, polio mass vaccination in NCR, Regions 3, 4A, Visayas
For the measles-rubella vaccine, the DOH targeted 5.1 million children to be vaccinated, of whom, almost 1.4 million have yet to be reached.
For the oral polio vaccine, almost 4.7 million children are targeted, but around 1.3 million children that have yet to receive it.
“Unfortunately, for some of the barangays in these areas, there has been increasing COVID-19 cases, and this puts some of the areas in lockdown. And that compromises the ability of our vaccination team to go into those areas,” Ho said as she enumerated the participating regions — National Capital Region, Region 3, 4A, 6, 7, and 8.
The health official said the vaccinators will push through with the campaign as soon as the lockdowns are lifted.Among the regions with the highest number of vaccination coverage is Region 3, with 85% of its target reached for oral polio vaccine and measles vaccine.
In case the lockdowns continue until after February, Ho said parents can still bring their children to health centers to be vaccinated.
After this mass immunization campaign, the agency will push for a higher rate of routine immunization since it is very “taxing” on health workers and local government units to do house-to-house vaccinations, she said.

Jean-Christophe Verhaegen, AFPMANILA — The World Health Organization on Tuesday said the Philippines already received a side letter from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Pfizer and that minor details are just being finalized in order for the country to receive its much-needed vaccines.
Pfizer’s vaccines through the COVAX Facility, of which WHO is a member, were supposed to be the first to arrive in the Philippines this month but the shipment was delayed due to the required indemnification agreement. The delay pushed back the scheduled immunization for health workers, who are being prioritized by the government.
Besides the need for an indemnification law or deal, “there are some several minor clauses” mentioned in a side letter sent by Pfizer to the Philippine government on Tuesday morning, according to WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.
“So we believe that within the day today or tomorrow, or whenever the legal teams (finalize) those documents, we will see a resolution of that impasse, and maybe there'll be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe told reporters.
Pfizer vaccine, wala pang tiyak na petsa ng pagdating sa bansa: Roque
Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is the first to receive an emergency use approval by the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration, followed by AstraZeneca and Sinovac.
Abeyasinghe previously said that besides the indemnification deal with COVAX, Pfizer is requiring a separate agreement for all countries ordering their vaccines through the COVAX Facility. He attributed the delay to Pfizer and not the Philippines.

He said that while the Philippines fulfilled all of its commitments to the COVAX Facility, which aims to give low and middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, “there have been some delays in finalizing the commitments between Pfizer-BioNtech, the manufacturer, and the Philippine government.”
“And we believe that the, that limited quantity of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines will be shipped as early as possible,” he said, “once these required exchange of letters is completed, and the requirements are met by the Philippine government and the manufacturer of the vaccine Pfizer-BioNtech.”Abeyasinghe clarified that all countries receiving COVID-19 vaccines are required to sign indemnification agreements with COVAX or directly with the manufacturers.
“The indemnification requirement is because the vaccines that are being rolled out are emergency use listed vaccines and the manufacturers cannot take responsibility for rare adverse events that may occur in, say, one in a million or one in ten million people. And so they require protection,” he said when asked if the Philippines was required to sign an indemnification agreement only because of the so-called dengvaxia controversy that happened a few years ago.
The WHO official said the requirements are “common to all countries"" and are ""not specific to the Philippines.""""They are not related to any issue that happened in the country, relating to the vaccine, or anything else,” he said.
Abeyasinghe said a delayed rollout of vaccines will continue to put at risk those most vulnerable to COVID-19 and those most likely to die from severe illness.
“I believe that everybody is doing everything possible within their remit of responsibility to fast track vaccines deliveries to countries. So, I'm not sure what more we can do,” he said, adding that delays in the inoculation drive against COVID-19 are also happening in other countries.
The Philippines on Tuesday has reported a total of 564,865 COVID-19 cases, of which, 29,817 are active infections. The death toll stands at 12,107.
Aside from Pfizer's, donated vaccines from China's Sinovac are being expected this month by the Philippine government.

MANILA - San Miguel Corp said Tuesday it is spending almost P1 billion to vaccinate all of its 70,000 employees against COVID-19 for free.
The company said it has secured COVID-19 vaccines from various sources and is currently preparing employees for vaccination with its “Ligtas Lahat” task force, in coordination with the government.
Receiving the vaccines is voluntary, but SMC President Ramon Ang said he hopes that all of their eligible employees will sign up for vaccination.
“Our program...aims to create a safe and healthy workplace so that we can further contribute to our country’s economic recovery,” Ang, said.
The government is allowing the private sector to procure its own vaccines against COVID-19. Procurement of vaccines will be free from taxes and duties until Dec. 31, 2023.

Dado Ruvic, Reuters/FileMANILA — The Philippines has completed all requirements for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines being supplied by the COVAX Facility, a World Health Organization official said on Tuesday.
The COVAX Facility, of which WHO is a member, is an initiative that aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
“I also want to update you that the Philippines has met all the requirements necessary for accessing the AstraZeneca vaccines,” WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said during a briefing with the Department of Health.
He confirmed around 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, which the Philippine drug regulator already approved for emergency use, have been earmarked for the country.

The government and the WHO previously said that the Philippines is set to receive AstraZeneca vaccines within the first quarter of the year.
Only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have been included in the WHO’s emergency use listing, making it easier for member countries to approve the said companies’ COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use.

“What we are now looking at is accelerating delivery of those AstraZeneca vaccines, at least a part of that shipment to the Philippines,” Abeyasinghe said.
He said Philippine officials have already signed the indemnification agreement with COVAX for the AstraZeneca vaccines.
“I understand that the Department of Health has supplied all the letters necessary to the COVAX initiative to access the early rollout of those AstraZeneca vaccines,” he said.
Unlike Pfizer, which required a separate indemnification deal with its recipient countries, Abeyasinghe said, “my understanding is that there is no requirement in the case of AstraZeneca for further exchange of letters between the manufacturer and the Philippine government.”
“We are optimistic that before the end of this week, we will hear from the COVAX initiative on likely delivery dates for AstraZeneca vaccines to the Philippines,” he said.
Asked if the Philippines is affected by the report that AstraZeneca is no longer taking additional vaccine orders, the WHO official said the Philippines’ vaccines from the COVAX Facility should not be affected.
He explained that AstraZeneca’s facility in South Korea is dedicated to exclusively manufacturing the COVAX Facility’s vaccine requirements while other countries are relying on the company’s facilities in Europe and in India.
“And what is earmarked for the Philippines will be coming from South Korea. So, we still remain optimistic that we will receive the AstraZeneca vaccines within the timeframes that we were talking about,” he said.
The Philippines was supposed to receive vaccines from Pfizer through the COVAX Facility this month. But it was delayed due to the company’s requirement for a separate indemnification agreement.
The delay pushed back the scheduled immunization for health workers, who are being prioritized by the government.
The Philippines has so far recorded 564,865 confirmed COVID-19 cases, of which, 29,817 are currently battling the disease.

""So, therefore I think that the greatest consequence of this would be the further delay in reopening the economy.""
Belmonte said she was however elated that the national government postponed placing the entire country under the less restrictive modified general community quarantine.
""Relief is an understatement. I was extremely happy to hear about that because, first and foremost, I felt that before we can actually loosened to the extent that this required by the MGCQ, I felt that at least the healthcare workers should be vaccinated first because they're the ones who will bear the brunt of the effects,"" she told ANC.
Belmonte was among 8 mayors who voted to retain the general community quarantine status in Metro Manila amid the threat of COVID-19 spread.
""To be honest I was one of the 8 mayors that voted to retain GCQ status, albeit I voted for the second category which is slight relaxation of the GCQ protocols,"" she said.

""Based on our data here in Quezon City, most of our cases come from the workplace. People who go to work, bring home the virus and then they infect their entire community, and then what happens is whole household become infected,"" she said.
As of Feb. 21, Quezon City has recorded 31,912 coronavirus infections, data from the city's health department showed. The city's tally includes 30,150 recoveries, 929 active cases and 833 fatalities.

The health chief said it is no longer advisable to lockdown cities in their entirety. Instead, lockdowns should be localized, focusing on specific sitios within barangays or on specific streets and compounds.
Such localized lockdown is currently being done in Pasay City, which has seen an increase in COVID-19 cases in the past days.
Duque said local government have dealt with COVID-19 for a year and that they already know what must be done to curb the spread of the disease in their areas.

MANILA — Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended for health workers, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday as it announced the approval of the product for emergency use in the Philippines.
“It has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4% when used on health care workers exposed to COVID-19. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this group,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
Health workers, numbering 1,762,994, top the country's list of priority sectors to receive COVID-19 vaccines once supplies arrive.

Domingo said that Phase III clinical trials done in different countries showed that Sinovac's vaccine has an efficacy rate of 65.3% based on trials in Indonesia, and up to 91.2% based on trials done in Turkey. The trials only involve adults aged 18 to 59 years.
Asked for more information on why health workers are advised not to receive the vaccine, Domingo said, “Ang nakita kasi sa trial sa Brazil, binigay ito sa mga health workers na nagtatrabaho sa hospitals na nagti-treat ng COVID, ay 50.4% ang efficacy n'ya.”
“Mas mabuti naman po iyon kaysa sa wala. Pero ang rekomendasyon ng ating mga experts ay hindi po ito ang pinakamagandang bakuna para sa kanila,” he added.(What they saw in Brazil is that when it was given to health workers working in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, the vaccine only had an efficacy rate of 50.4%. This is better than nothing, but the recommendation of experts is that it is not the best vaccine for health workers.)
The vaccine's efficacy rate is between 63 percent to 91 percent on members of the community who are not healthworkers, Domingo told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo Tuesday,
""Maganda po talaga. Ang mga pagaaral po nila sa mga regular na mamamayan sa community...na hindi naman po exposed na very highly concentrated sa COVID-19 ay maganda ang kaniyang protection rate, umaabot ng 91 percent,"" he said.
(It's good. Their studies on regular members of the community...who are not exposed in areas highly concentrated with COVID-19 is it has a good protection rate that goes up to 91 percent.)

Before the FDA approval of Sinovac, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the firm's vaccine will most likely be the first to arrive in the Philippines this month.
Duque said it will take China 3 to 5 days to prepare the shipment of 600,000 doses it is donating to the Philippines.
When Presidential spokesman Harry Roque first announced over a week ago that the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines on Tuesday, Feb. 23, has been etched in stone, he said 100,000 doses of those will go to the Philippine military.
The delivery of the said supply is expected to be delayed, however, following China's decision to await first the FDA's issuance of an emergency use authorization (EUA).

When Sinovac's vaccine arrives, Domingo told ABS-CBN News that the Department of Health will set the prioritization for its recipients, excluding health workers.
Roque said that the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG) will meet later Monday to tackle a possible revision in the priority list of recipients for the Sinovac jabs.
“Siguro, kinakailangan nilang baguhin muna iyong ating list of priorities,” he said in a separate briefing.

“Baka mauna na iyong ating tinatawag na economic frontliners na kasama po ng ating kasundaluhan.”(Our so-called economic frontliners might go first with our military.)
Economic frontliners include those who continued to work during last year’s enhance community quarantine, the strictest of 4 lockdown levels in the country, Roque said.Establishments like supermarkets, groceries, drugstores, and other service-oriented centers were allowed to operate during the ECQ.
The DOH has yet to respond to questions on whether it will follow the FDA’s recommendation and what will happen if Sinovac’s vaccines arrive first in the country.
Nearly 15,000 health workers in the Philippines have been infected with COVID-19, of whom, 249 were battling the disease, as of Feb. 20.
At the peak of the outbreak, health workers comprised 20% of infected individuals in the country. It has since gone down to 3%, although health workers remain among those most exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Meanwhile, recipients of the 100,000 doses from Sinovac's donation intended for the Department of National Defense and its bureaus will be administered by the Veterans Medical Center and V. Luna Medical Center, according to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.
He clarified that the Armed Forces of the Philippines will not received any of those.
""Two doses kasi, kaya 50,000 lang ang kaya ng 100K. Tama lang sa DND personnel and their families,"" said Lorenzana.
(Since it requires two doses, only 50,000 recipients can avail of the 100,000 doses. It's just right for DND personnel and their families.)
The defense chief earlier expressed willingness to be inoculated with Sinovac's vaccine. But, upon learning that he doesn't fall within the recommended age range of recipients, he said he would wait for the next vaccine instead.

MANILA (UPDATE) — The Food and Drug Administration has granted an emergency use authorization for the COVID-19 vaccine of China's Sinovac Biotech, paving the way for its delivery to the Philippines, an official said Monday.
“After a thorough and rigorous review of the currently available published and unpublished data by our regulatory and medical experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac Life Sciences Company, known as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Vero Cell Inactivated, o yung trade name nya ay CoronaVac,"" FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
""The benefit of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risk,” he added.
Domingo said that interim data from Sinovac show the vaccine has an efficacy rate on patients aged 18 to 59 years of 65.3%, based on trials in Indonesia, and up to 91.2% based on trials done in Turkey.
“However, it has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4% when used on health care workers exposed to COVID-19. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this group,” the official said.
3 TO 5 DAYS
Before the announcement, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said during the same briefing that China’s Sinovac is the COVID-19 vaccine brand likely to arrive in the Philippines before the month ends.

“Malamang, Sinovac po yan ang posibleng dumating na 600,000 doses (Sinovac’s 600,000 doses is likely to arrive). Good for 300,000 individuals,” Duque said.He said that once the EUA is released, it will only take 3 to 5 days for the Chinese Embassy to prepare the shipment of the vaccines.
This is the third COVID-19 vaccine product that has received an EUA in the Philippines, following those developed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

PH approves AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use
Palace spokesman Harry Roque earlier said 600,000 Beijing-donated Sinovac shots would arrive on Feb. 23. He said 100,000 of these doses would go to the military, and the rest to health workers.
However, Roque later said that the lack of an EUA might delay the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines.
MILD TO MODERATE SIDE EFFECTS
Domingo said experts recommend two equal and standard doses of 0.5 mL each, given 4 weeks apart, for patients receiving Sinovac's vaccine.
“The adverse events reported were transient and mostly mild to moderate similar to common vaccine reactions,"" he said.
""No specific safety concerns were identified. But it must be noted that this only reflects limited follow-up, and more adverse effects may emerge that’s why close surveillance and monitoring is needed after the immunization,” he added.
Besides being certified Halal by Indonesia, Domingo said Sinovac is a “good option for individuals who have allergies to components of other available vaccines such as the polyethylene glycol and polysorbate.”
The 2 ingredients are said to cause anaphylaxis and severe allergies, although such effects were very rare.
Polyethylene glycol is said to be among the ingredients of mRNA vaccines like that of Pfizer’s, while polysorbate is said to be in viral vector vaccines.
Before Sinovac’s EUA was approved, the government was expecting Pfizer to send the first batch of doses through the COVAX Facility.But the shipment was delayed due to a pending indemnification agreement. The Philippine government said it already signed the agreement with COVAX, but the World Health Organization, which is a member of COVAX Facility, said it is still waiting a separate indemnification deal from Pfizer.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines confirmed 1,888 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday bringing the country’s total to 561,169.
The Department of Health also reported 9,737 new recoveries pushing the total number of Filipinos who recovered from the disease to 522,843.
This meant that the country has a total of 26,238 active cases as of 4 p.m. Sunday.
Twenty more deaths were reported from the illness, bringing COVID-19’s death toll in the Philippines to 12,088.
Among the country’s regions, the National Capital Region had the most number of new confirmed infections at 618. NCR was followed by Region 7 or Central Visayas with 404, and the Cordillera Administrative Region at 176.Cebu City had the most number of new cases at 169, followed by Cebu province and Quezon City which both had 107 new cases.The 618 cases is the highest daily tally in NCR since December 18, 2020. This marks the 4th straight day that Metro Manila reported more than 500 new cases. The last time this happened was November 5-8, last year.

The government earlier said it can inoculate 50 to 70 million Filipinos against COVID-19 by the end of the year if vaccine supplies arrive on time.
However, the top official in charge of rolling out COVID-19 vaccines said procurement of the medicines was delayed over manufacturers’ concerns that the Philippines may sue them, just like it did with Sanofi over the Dengvaxia vaccines.
Several new and more infectious variants of the novel coronavirus have emerged. One variant, which was first reported in the United Kingdom, has spread to the Philippines.
The UK coronavirus variant: what we know
Eighteen new cases of the UK variant were confirmed earlier on Sunday, bringing the county's total to 62.The DOH has also confirmed two mutations of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, in Central Visayas.
Another variant from South Africa, has drawn concern from scientists as vaccines seem to be less effective against it.The country’s first COVID-19 case was a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, China, which was confirmed by the DOH on Jan. 30, last year.
The pandemic has already caused the Philippines to plunge into its worst economic contraction since World War 2.
Worldwide, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 111 million people and caused over 2.46 million deaths since it first emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.
The United States remains the most badly affected country with over 28 million infections and over 497,000 deaths.
India follows the US with 10.99 million infections. Brazil ranks third with 10.1 million infections but is second in terms of deaths with over 245,000 COVID-19 fatalities.

MANILA — An official leading the country's COVID-19 vaccination strategy apologized on Friday for the delay in the arrival of vaccines, as the Philippines lagged behind some of its regional neighbors that have already launched their respective inoculation drives.While mayors in Metro Manila have presented their own inoculation plans, the Philippines has not yet received any vaccine shipment.
“Kaunting pasensya lang po. Pasensya na po talaga na talagang hindi po natin kasi hawak iyong ating supply chain… doon sa mga vaccine,” said Carlito Galvez Jr, chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.(Have a little more patience. I apologize because we don't control our supply chain for the vaccines.)
“Sana po maintindihan n’yo po ang kalagayan ng gobyerno. Kami po talaga, ginagawa po namin ang aming magagawa, lalo na sa FDA, na sana iyong aming, iyong ating vaccine na dadalhin dito ay very safe, effective,” he told mayors and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority.(I hope you understand the situation of the government. We are doing everything, especially the Food and Drug Administration so that the vaccines that will be brought here will be safe, effective.)
'Naiinip na': Duterte getting impatient over COVID-19 vaccine delay - Palace
Galvez, a former general, earlier said the absence of an indemnification program has delayed delivery of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech shots allocated to the Philippines through the vaccine sharing platform COVAX Facility.
The government had planned to use those, which were due to arrive in mid-February, to kick off its vaccination campaign.
PH still has to sign separate indemnity deal with Pfizer for its COVID-19 vaccine, says WHO
Malacañang this week said a separate shipment of 600,000 doses from China's Sinovac Biotech might be delayed due to its lack of an emergency use authorization in the Philippines.
“Minsan, ako po'y nahihiya dahil sabi nga, bakuna na lang ang kulang. Nasaan na iyong bakuna? Iyon ang question po sa atin ngayon,” said Galvez.(Sometimes, I am ashamed because as some say, everything is ready, we just lack the vaccines. Where are the vaccines? That's the question to us.)
“Bilang the leading person to really procure and manage and get the best vaccine for all of us, nakita natin na talagang medyo nahuli tayo nang kaunti.”(As the leading person to really procure and manage and get the best vaccine for all of us, we saw that we have lagged a bit.)

Galvez said 10 countries account for about 75 percent of 190 million global vaccinations, which he attributed to ""geopolitics.""He also notes that even Australia, which had excess vaccine orders, had yet to start its inoculation drive, while Japan has just started.
The Philippines' negotiation with the COVAX Facility is ""ongoing,"" he said.“We are hopeful na iyong COVAX, they will fulfill their commitment to bring us the 44 million doses,” said Galvez.“Dapat intindihin din natin sila, na iyong pagbabakuna ng buong mundo, isang malaking hamon din sa kanila,”
(We should also understand them because the global vaccination is a big challenge to them.)
Philippine officials will visit the Serum Institute of India that will produce 2 to 3 billion vaccine doses, including 30 million Novavax shots for the Philippines, he said.“Sa awa po ng Diyos, siguro po tingnan po natin, baka po meron ding umabot na vaccine this coming February and majority of our vaccine, baka magdating po ng March,” Galvez said.(God willing, let's see, perhaps a vaccine will arrive this February, and majority of our vaccines might arrive in March.)
“Iyon ina-advise ko po sa ating mga kababayan, na sana kaunting pasensya pa,” he added.
(This is my advice to our compatriots, I hope they could have a little more patience.)
Further delays in the vaccination drive could derail economic recovery after the country's worst contraction on record last year, when it slumped 9.5 percent, the biggest decline in Southeast Asia.

MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte is getting impatient over delays in the supposed arrival this month of the country's first COVID-19 vaccines, Malacañang said on Friday, as the Philippines trailed some of its regional neighbors that have launched their inoculation drive.""Tatapatin ko kayo: si Presidente ang nagsalita na. Siya mismo naiinip na,"" said Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque.(I will be direct with you, the President has spoken. He is growing impatient.)

(The vaccines need to arrive. Now that the President has spoken, everyone will move faster.)
The Philippines is negotiating supply agreements with seven manufacturers for 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, so it can inoculate 70 million adults, or two-thirds of its more than 108 million population.
Vaccine manufacturers want protection from future product liability claims before they deliver the shots, authorities have said.

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN NewsMANILA — The Philippines has signed an indemnity deal required to get COVID-19 vaccines from US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and United Kingdom's AstraZeneca, an official leading the inoculation effort said on Wednesday.Authorities submitted the agreement to the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that seeks to ensure equitable access to the vaccines, said Carlito Galvez Jr, chief implementer of the National Task Force against COVID-19 in a public briefing.
Under the indemnity deal, the national government will be responsible and shoulder the cost for adverse effects on those inoculated, NTF deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said.
""Nakapagpirma na po at naisumite na po natin ang mga requirements. Kasama na po dito ang indemnification agreements para sa Pfizer at AstraZeneca.

The processing of some documents earlier snagged the arrival of an initial batch of 117,000 Pfizer doses from the COVAX Facility this month, Dizon earlier said. He did not say if the documents include the indemnity agreement.
Such a deal is standard requirement for vaccine manufacturers, Dizon said.
""Ito po kasing mga bakunang ito ay hindi pa natatapos ang proseso ng product registration sa buong mundo,"" said Dizon.

But the interior department placed this figure lower, saying only 3 in 10 Metro Manila residents wanted to get the jabs.
VIP TREATMENT?Other officials like Metro Manila mayors are willing to get vaccines in public, said Roque.
“Ang aking ini-emphasize lang, ‘wag naman po kapag nauna ang mga namumuno, e sasabihing VIP,” he said.

MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippines' chef de mission to the upcoming Tokyo Olympics is ready to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to reassure athletes about its safety.
This, even though vaccination is not mandatory for athletes and other delegates bound for the Tokyo Games in July.
""Hindi naman mandatory, but it is advised by the IOC (International Olympic Committee) na kung puwede, magpa-vaccinate 'yung mga athletes,"" said Mariano ""Nonong"" Araneta, the country's chef-de-mission to the Games, in an appearance on ""The Chasedown"" last Saturday.
""Dito naman sa atin, we're trying our best na … magkaroon ng vaccines ang athletes,"" he added. ""Hopefully by May, magkakaroon na tayo ng vaccine.""
However, confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines remains an issue. On Sunday, the Department of Interior and Local Government reported that only three out of 10 individuals in Metro Manila are willing to be vaccinated.
At least one athlete who is hopeful of qualifying to the Tokyo Olympics has also expressed their misgivings about the COVID-19 vaccine, citing potential side effects.
Araneta is ready to get vaccinated, however, in order to boost the athletes' confidence in the process.
""Siyempre ako, magpa-vaccine ako para makita nila,"" he said.
Araneta, also the president of the Philippine Football Federation (PFF), further revealed that they have placed an order of the COVID-19 vaccine for football players and officials.
Philippine sports officials have pushed for athletes -- particularly those who are going to the Olympics and Olympic qualifying tournaments -- to be vaccinated.
Deputy speaker Mikee Romero, also the owner of the NorthPort franchise in the PBA, has filed a resolution that will give elite Filipino athletes priority in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.Meanwhile, Philippine Olympic Committee president Rep. Abraham ""Bambol"" Tolentino announced recently that business tycoon Enrique Razon, chairman of the International Container Terminal Services, Inc., has agreed to provide the country's Olympic-bound athletes and coaches with the COVID-19 vaccine.

Four Filipinos have already qualified to the Tokyo Olympics -- pole vaulter EJ Obiena, gymnast Carlos Yulo, and boxers Irish Magno and Eumir Marcial.
Over 80 other Filipino athletes are still seeking qualification, including weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, golfers Yuka Saso and Bianca Pagdanganan, boxer Nesthy Petecio, skateboarder Margielyn Didal, and judoka Kiyomi Watanabe.

MANILA - Some 24,000 residents of San Juan City have signed up to get themselves inoculated with the vaccine against COVID-19, Mayor Francis Zamora said Monday.
This is almost 3 times the number it initially reported last month. Zamora said he has volunteered to be among the first ones to receive the vaccine to be able to boost his constituents' confidence about it.""As of today, we have 24,559 registrants. We were informed by DOH (Department of Health) that we are ranked number 1 in Metro Manila in terms of the number of registrants. I believe that by volunteering, it shows people that the vaccine process can be trusted, that the mayor himself will undergo the process,"" he told ANC's Headstart.
Zamora said the local government is going house to house to encourage residents to register for the vaccination, bringing along a tablet so that they may do so on the spot. Manual registration is also available at barangay halls and health centers, he said.
""I am very confident that here in San Juan, we will be able to vaccinate 100 percent of those who register and those who qualify with the medical clearance,"" he said.
San Juan has prepared at least 5 vaccination sites, including hospitals and transformed gymnasiums, where some 100 employees will be available to inject the drug into patients.
Zamora said first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine would be the 3,700 frontline and health workers in San Juan, to be followed by senior citizens and indigents.
The city targets to inoculate some 85,000 people to reach 70 percent of its population of 122,000. Zamora is ""very optimistic"" the current number of registrants will increase once the vaccination process is rolled out.
The local government of San Juan has signed a tripartite agreement with the national government and AstraZeneca for the procurement of 100,000 coronavirus shots.
Several Philippine LGUs sign deals to buy AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine
As the city is also part of Metro Manila, it may receive some vaccines from Pfizer, which will be given by the COVAX facility, he said.Zamora said if China-made Sinovac gets an emergency use authorization like AstraZeneca and Pfizer and if the national government gives assurance of its safety, then it may also be used.
A survey revealed by the Department of the Interior and Local Government on Sunday showed that only 3 out of 10 individuals in Metro Manila were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

MANILA - Only 3 out of 10 individuals in Metro Manila are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) bared Sunday.
According to DILG Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III, a survey conducted by the department showed 20 to 30 percent of the capital region's residents affirmed their consent to be inoculated against the deadly disease.
This is much lower than the DILG's target of immunizing at least 80 percent of Metro Manila residents.

An online survey conducted by University of Santo Tomas professors and students had also showed only 55.9 percent of their 15,651 respondents are willing to be vaccinated.
The open access online survey, conducted by the UST-CoVAX research team from January 16 to 30, 2021 and posted on several social media platforms in both Filipino and English forms, was answered by Filipinos from all 17 regions in the country.

Vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said he was hoping that an initial batch of 117,000 doses manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech will arrive on Feb. 15.

MANILA — Half of the 10,000 COVID-19 vaccines that will be received by the Presidential Security Group through a compassionate special permit (CSP) will be given to the wives and close contacts of the soldiers, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.Asked why the PSG was allowed to receive as donation as much as 10,000 doses, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said there are 2,000 members of the PSG who are guarding President Rodrigo Duterte while in Malacañang, Davao and “everywhere he goes.”
“’Yung kalahati for the actual PSG members and the other half would be for close contacts of the PSG members meaning, of course, ’yung asawa. Syempre ’pag pag-uwi nya sa bahay ’yun ’yung kasama n’ya. So they included that,” Domingo told reporters during a video call.
(Half of that for actual PSG members and the other half would be for close contacts of the PSG members meaning, of course, the wives. Of course, when they go home they are with their wives so they included that.)
He said the 10,000 doses are enough for 5,000 people.
READ: PSG gets go signal to use COVID-19 shots months after some members got unauthorized jabs
Because the FDA does not guarantee the safety of vaccines under CSP, he said the PSG hospital is responsible for those who will receive the jabs.
Even the close contacts will receive the vaccines through the PSG Hospital.
Domingo said he specifically instructed the hospital, which requested for the compassionate special permit on January 18, to make a monthly report of those who received the vaccines. He said the report should detail any adverse event or side effect experienced by the vaccine recipients.
“Ang sabi ko sa kanila ’wag antaying maubos ang bakuna kundi buwan buwan magreport sa atin,” he said.
(I told them not to wait for the vaccine to run out but instead report monthly to us.)
Asked why the PSG did not wait for the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines vetted by the FDA since there are already two brands with emergency use authorization, Domingo said: “I cannot answer that for the PSG.”
However, he said it might be because under the priority sector groupings, the PSG will have to wait awhile before they are vaccinated through the national immunization program.“Kaya siguro sila naka-secure ng donation para hindi na makapila, makabawas sa pila. ’Yun lang ang aking opinion on it,” he said, adding that he also does not know why the PSG chose Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company, in particular.
(That’s probably why they secured a donation so they don’t have to fall in line, to not add to the queue. That’s just my opinion on it.)
Domingo said a compassionate special permit is regularly given to specialty groups and hospitals to allow the use of experimental drugs for particular individuals.
He said the PSG explained that it needed the vaccines because its members’ job is to protect the president.“And, of course, as part of the personal security of the president hindi naman sila nakakasunod sa social distancing protocols,” Domingo said. “And since we know that the health of the president is a national security issue we don’t want him getting sick and those around him hindi dapat magkasakit we decided to grant the special permit for the PSG.”
(And of course as part of the personal security of the President they cannot observe social distancing protocols…And since we know that the health of the president is a national security issue we don’t want him getting sick and those around him can’t get sick, we decided to grant the special permit for the PSG.)

MANILA - Belgium has guaranteed that COVID-19 vaccines will be available to all countries, including the Philippines.
In a note verbale transmitted to foreign embassies in the European country Thursday, Belgium said that companies “will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations towards third countries, and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will not be interrupted.”
Two pharmaceutical firms that produce COVID-19 vaccines— Pfizer and Janssen— are manufactured in Belgium.
The note verbale, a copy of which was shared by the Belgian Embassy in the Philippines, discussed the new procedure for requesting an export license to procure COVID-19 vaccines from outside the European Union (EU).
It highlighted that ""within the framework of this new procedure, these companies will be able to fulfil their contractual obligations towards third countries and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will not be interrupted.""
“The Belgian Government takes pride in the fact that Belgium is the home of the production facilities of some of the world’s most renowned pharmaceutical companies and will spare no effort to ensure that within the framework of this new procedure, these companies will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations towards third countries and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will not be interrupted,” the note verbale read.
The Embassy said Belgium “is very proud to be at the epicenter of the manufacturing of vaccines during this pandemic.”
“Belgium guarantees that the COVID-19 vaccines will be available for all countries, including the Philippines,” the Embassy said.
The Philippines earlier approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use as the country aims to immunize 100,000 to 200,000 Filipinos daily in a national vaccine rollout.
The country's first batch of 117,000 COVID-19 shots from the US-Belgian drugmaker will come from the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to vaccines. The Philippine vaccine czar said they will request an additional 900,000 Pfizer vaccines.

Rodriguez Memorial Hospital (DJNRMH) or Tala Hospital in Caloocan City expects the delivery on Sunday of around 800 vials of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer, its chief said Thursday.
“Tentative, possible arrival is Sunday. ‘Yung time, wala pang binibigay sa amin na estimated time of arrival,” Dr. Fritz Famaran told ABS-CBN News.
(The tentative, possible arrival is Sunday. We were not yet given the estimated time of arrival.)
""Ang (The) first and second dose can be handled by the ultra low freezer of the hospital. Isang bagsakan lang ito (This will be a one-time delivery),” he added.
The DJNRMH is among four hospitals, all in Metro Manila, whose staff will be prioritized in the distribution of COVID-19 shots upon arrival. The three others are the Philippine General Hospital in Manila City, and the Lung Center of the Philippines and East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City.

DOH: No confirmed date of COVID-19 vaccine arrival, start of inoculations
On Thursday, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque told a news briefing that there is no tentative arrival date yet for the first batch of 117,000 Pfizer shots from the COVAX Facility.
""Inaasahan po natin, hindi matatapos ang buwan ng Pebrero at darating din ang paunang shipment galing sa COVAX Facility,"" he said.(We expect that February will not end without an initial shipment from the COVAX Facility.)
Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has been granted emergency use authority in the Philippines by the Food and Drug Administration.
A vial of it is good for 5 individuals, each with a single dose, according to Famaran.
“One vial, idi-dilute mo yun. Kukunin mo dun is .3 ml. So, that's .3 (ml) times 5,"" he explained.
(You first dilute. Then, you extract .3 ml for each dose.)
TALA HOSPITAL’S COLD CHAIN FACILITY PREPS
According to Felina Jane Barongan, officer-in-charge of the hospital's pharmacy, maintaining the hospital’s cold chain is critical for Pfizer’s vaccines.
Pfizer's vaccine, which uses new messenger RNA-based technology, has to be kept in a -70 degrees Celsius freezer, unlike the other COVID-19 vaccines. It has the highest efficacy rate at 95 percent, based on current data.

Barongan said the hospital’s ultra-low freezer has been set to -70 degrees Celsius earlier this week in preparation for the vaccines’ arrival.
“Nag-set na tayo rito ng -70 (degrees Celsius). Pagkatumaas ‘yong temperatura, nag-aalarm yung freezer, audible alarm na maririnig sa buong pharmacy,” she said.
(We already set the temperature to -70 degrees Celsius. Once the temperature rises, the freezer will sound an alarm that can be heard in the entire pharmacy.)
Preparing the vaccines includes the thawing process of the vials that can last 3 to 4 hours inside a refrigerator with a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. Afterwards, the vials will need an additional 30 minutes under room temperature before the actual administration of the vaccine, she explained.Once taken out of the refrigerator, Pfizer’s vaccines should be opened within 2 hours. And once diluted, the vaccine should be administered to an individual within 6 hours.“Kung ano lang yung kailangan, yun lang ang ilalabas sa freezer,” she pointed out.
(We will only get from the freezer the exact number of vaccines we will need.)
“Yung vaccine na ito is different from other vaccines. Para ma-maintain natin yung integrity and efficacy of the vaccine, kailangan natin siya ihiwalay sa iba, kasi hindi tayo basta-basta. Kumbaga, masuwerte kami, nabigyan kami ng mga vaccines na ito,” she said.
(To maintain the integrity and efficacy of the vaccine, we need to separate it from the others... We are lucky to be receiving these vaccines.)On Thursday, a total of 1,600 employees have already registered in their vaccine masterlist, of whom, 86 percent said they agreed to recieve the shots, according to Famaran.The hospital chief said the reason for some hesitancy by some employees stem from the supposed side effects of the vaccines, and no longer about the brand.Some health workers wary of COVID-19 vaccine, but those in favor outnumber them - polls

“Kahit na Pfizer, kasi 'di ba, may mga media news na sabi gumamit ng Pfizer, medyo hindi maganda, unverified yung kanilang reports pertaining to the side effects of the vaccine,” he said.
Famaran said he has allotted slots for those who might change their mind at the last minute.
He also has yet to see reports on employees who might have allergic reactions to the vaccine.
Five staff of the hospital are currently confined in the facility due to COVID-19. Famaran said they contracted the disease outside of the hospital

Australia redirected its 2020 development assistance programs to reinforce the Philippine response to the pandemic.Foreign Minister Marise Payne announced in October that Australia has committed $500 million to support access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and to promote health security in the Indo-Pacific, including in the Philippines.This includes a AUD$21-million contribution to the new ASEAN Center for Public Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases, which will help combat COVID-19 and prepare the region for future pandemics.
Malacañang earlier said the Philippines is ready to launch its COVID-19 vaccination drive next week, months after the country awaited its supply of doses.

“The COVAX Facility initially told us by 2nd or 3rd of February. Now this February 15 is an indicative date,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a virtual briefing.
The COVAX Facility is a global initiative, composed of groups including the World Health Organization, that aims for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines around the world.
“Wala pa tayong confirmed dates as to when are we going to start.
Definitely 'pag dumating 'yung bakuna after 2 to 3 days we will start the deployment already. We will start the vaccination already makatapos dumating dito,” Vergeire said.

The country will get some 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the COVAX Facility in the first quarter, including 117,000 doses of the Pfizer jabs, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said.
The government has been preparing for the arrival of the vaccines to ensure that they are kept in good quality and in proper temperature levels while being transported to different storage facilities.

MAYNILA - Naghahanda na ang bansa sa pagdating at pag-rollout ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 sa kalagitnaan ng buwan. Pero marami pa ring Pilipino ang may alinlangan hinggil sa bakuna at posibleng maging epekto nito sa kanila.
Sa panayam ng TeleRadyo, Miyerkoles ng umaga, kay Dr. Rommel Crisenio Lobo, vice chair ng National Adverse Events Following Immunization Committee, sinagot niya ang ilang katanungan hinggil sa pagbabakuna kontra COVID-19.
Palace says Philippines ready to start COVID-19 vaccinations next week
ANO ANG DAPAT ASAHAN MATAPOS MAGPABAKUNA?
Ayon kay Lobo, may mga taong walang nararamdamang reaksiyon matapos mabakunahan. Mayroon namang iba na nagkakaroon ng reaksiyon, pero ito ay normal lang, aniya.
“Meron pong iba, nakakaramdam ng pananakit o pamamaga sa injection site o pamumula. Normal reaction po yun. Ibig sabihin, yung bakuna, maganda ang uptake sa katawan natin, na-recognize ng ating immune system. Meron pong iba, nilalagnat o inaantok. Pero, kadalasan, maa-address po 'yun sa pagbigay ng paracetamol sa lagnat at pananakit. Tapos, after 2 or 3 days, mawawala po siyang mag-isa,” sabi ni Lobo.
Pwede ring lagyan ng ice compress ang injection site para mabawasan ang pananakit at pamamaga.
PUWEDE BANG UMINOM NG GAMOT BILANG PAGHAHANDA BAGO MABAKUNAHAN?
Ayon kay Lobo, hindi inirerekomenda ang pre-medication o ang pag-inom ng gamot, tulad ng anti-allergy, bago magpabakuna.
“Kadalasan po kasi, baka mangyari, ma-delay yung reaction. Inoobserbahan sila for 30 minutes, baka po walang makita; tapos pagdating sa bahay, meron. Kaya po, mas maganda, wala po silang ininom na gamot para po kita yung reaction, kung meron,” saad niya.
Magkakaroon rin naman ng screening sa mga taong babakunahan kung saan kukunin ang kanilang vital signs at magsasagawa rin ng counseling.
“Tatanungin kayo kung meron kayong reaction previously, mga gamot na iniinom para malaman din kung merong posibilidad na magkaroon ng cross reaction sa mga sinasabing gamot o sa bakuna,” sabi niya.

GAANO KATAGAL DAPAT OBSERBAHAN MATAPOS MABAKUNAHAN?
Matapos mabakunahan, hinikayat ni Lobo ang mga pasyente na huwag magmadaling umuwi.
“Kadalasan po, 30 minutes will be sufficient kasi po yung mga nagkakaroon ng allergic reaction, yung severe allergic reaction na sinasabi natin na anaphylaxis doon po sa isang Brighton Collaboration study, nakita po nila na almost 70 percent ng magkakaroon ng severe allergic reaction, nakikita po within 15 minutes. Tapos umaabot po ng 80 to 85 percent pagkabago po mag-30 minutes. Kaya mas safe po yung 30 minutes na observation period,” paliwanag niya.
PAANO MASASABI NA ANG ADVERSE EVENT AY SA BAKUNA O SA IBANG FACTOR GALING?
Sabi ni Lobo, kadalasang nagkakaroon sila ng investigation for causality.
“Tinitingnan natin po yung relasyon, yung paglabas ng sinasabing kino-complain nila at saka mga oras kung kailan lumabas yun, at saka kung expected po na reaction sa mga bakunang ibinibigay,” ani Lobo.
Kailangan maibestigahan muna umano ito bago mag-deklara na mayroong causality, na may kinalaman ang kanilang naranasang reaksiyon sa bakuna.
“Yun po ay pinagmimitingan din ng mga imbestigador para po magkaroon ng 100 porsiyento na may basehan sa siyensa, na doon nga galing sa bakuna yun o hindi,” dagdag niya.
Sakaling makaranas ng adverse reaction, tulad ng hirap sa paghinga, at naimbestigahan na ito ay galing sa bakuna, ang pasyente ay hindi na maaaring mabigyan ng ikalawang dose ng bakuna.
Mayroon ring protocol na susundin para sa mga pasyenteng magkakaroon ng severe allergic reaction.
“Meron pong mga gamot na ini-inject sa inyo para hindi na mag-progress (ang) reaction n'yo; at the same time, mahinto po siya,” sabi niya.
Ipinaalala niya na ang ibinibigay ng pamahalaan ng emergency use authorization sa mga bakuna ay hindi lisensiya para sa pagbenta sa mga vaccine. Ito ay pagtitiyak lang din na ang bakunang ibibigay sa mga Pilipino ay ligtas, epektibo at libre.
'COVID-19 vaccination not mandatory but Pinoys must realize it can protect their families'

OBSERBAHAN MUNA MGA NABAKUNAHAN
Ginagawa aniya nila ang information campaign para iparating sa publiko na ligtas ang bakuna at maialis ang kanilang agam-agam kaugnay dito.
Kahit pa mahigpit na sinusunod ang pagsuot ng face mask, face shield, paghuhugas ng kamay at physical distancing, ang mga minimum health protocols na ito ay nagpapabagal lamang sa pagkalat ng COVID-19, pero hindi tuluyang nakapipigil sa virus.
“Pagka sinama ang bakuna doon, at maraming tao ang nabakunahan, doon lang po makakabangon ang ating ekonomiya at saka makakatulong po sa atin bawat isa,” sabi niya.
Para mapawi ang agam-agam ng marami tungkol sa pagpapabakuna, lalo na ang may mga iniindang sakit o may mga allergy, mas mainam na kumonsulta muna sa kanilang mga doktor o mga espesyalista tulad ng allergists.
Iniimbitahan ni Lobo ang publiko na tumutok sa kanilang Facebook Live kung saan tatalakayin ang allergies at COVID-19 vaccines ngayong Huwebes, Pebrero 11, alas-9 ng umaga.
“Mag-o-open to questions po 'yan at sasagutin namin mga katanungan nila,” sabi niya.

MANILA - The Philippines is aiming to complete its COVID-19 vaccination program by 2023, a health official said Wednesday, amid global competition of the highly sought-after coronavirus shots.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the government had until 2023 to inoculate its targeted population in case vaccine deliveries would be delayed.
""That's why we indicated in our plan for this vaccine deployment program that it's going to be until 2023 so that we have that wide margin if in case the delivery will not be on time,"" she said in an interview on ANC.
""We are eyeing that we can be able to reduce this (number of COVID-19 cases) or have good outcomes based on these vaccines hopefully by 2022, earlier than the 2023 target date,"" she added.
Palace says Philippines ready to start COVID-19 vaccinations next week
The country is expected to launch its COVID-19 immunization next week as some 117,000 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech jabs may arrive on Feb. 13.
Health authorities on Tuesday conducted simulation on the arrival of the vaccines, which were transported to the cold storage facility in Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in less than an hour.
""As long as the temperatures will be maintained, the hours or the time from the airport to the storage facility will not really matter,"" she said.
Based on a novel technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus, the Pfizer/BioNTech needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below -- equivalent to an Antarctic winter.
In the government's vaccination plan, health workers shall first receive the COVID-19 jabs. They are followed by older people, persons with comorbidities or underlying conditions, other essential workers, including uniformed personnel, and indigent population -- all in group A.
Next in the priority list is group B, which are other frontline workers and special population. The remaining population or group C is at the bottom of the pile.
The Philippines aims to vaccinate up to 70 million people against COVID-19 this year to achieve herd immunity.
It is working to lock in 148 million doses from various drug makers, on top of 5.6 million shots that will come from the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to the vaccines.

MANILA — Vaccines against COVID-19 that have been approved for emergency use cannot be sold and bought commercially, the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reminded the public Tuesday as the country prepares for the arrival in the coming days of its initial vaccine supplies.
“Bawal po 'yan at 'wag kayong bibili dahil wala pa pong produkto (COVID-19 vaccine) sa buong mundo na may marketing authorization - ibig sabihin na fully developed na na maaring ibenta sa publiko,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
(That’s not allowed and you should not buy because there is still no product in the world that has a marketing authorization - meaning it has been fully developed and can be sold to the public.)

Domingo issued the warning after the Healthcare Professionals Alliance against COVID-19 called out private companies purchasing vaccines and allegedly selling it to individuals in advance.Currently, all COVID-19 vaccines are still under development, which is why they are only given an emergency use authorization to help fight the pandemic.
Domingo said he and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III met with health workers on Monday evening to discuss the matter.
“The DOH and FDA will be coming up with a statement to be very clear na ang bakuna ay maaari lang ma-access (that vaccines can only be accessed) through the government vaccination program,” said Domingo.
While the national government is allowed to designate local government units and private companies to be part of the vaccination program, they still have to follow the guidelines of the Department of Health, he added.
“At syempre po, pinangako ni Pangulo na libre ang bakuna at hindi babayaran itong mga ito.”
(And of course, the President said the vaccine should be free and should not be paid for by Filipinos.)
Domingo said the FDA, meanwhile, is working closely with the Philippine National Police, the Bureau of Customs and the National Bureau of Investigation to make sure that fake vaccines will not enter the Philippines.
“Pag dumating ang genuine o authentic vaccines, ito rin ang time na maaring may sumabay na fake na vaccines. We have to be very very careful. Binabantayan naman po,” he said.
(When the genuine or authentic vaccines arrive, this is also the time that fake vaccines might spread. We have to be very, very careful. We’re closely monitoring it.)
He said only vaccines used in the national vaccination program are authentic and those sold outside are most likely fake.

The Philippines aims to immediately start inoculating its target population after the arrival in a few days of its initial batch of COVID-19 vaccine supplies.
Up to around 70 million individuals are being eyed for coverage of the vaccination program to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus.
On Tuesday, the country's total COVID-19 cases reached 540,227, including 29,167 active infections, 11,296 deaths and 499,764 recoveries.

MANILA - AirAsia is securing approval from the Philippine government to handle shipments of COVID-19 vaccines nationwide, the company said Tuesday.
AirAsia said it recently applied to be a ""Dangerous Goods carrier"", and is now in the process of getting authorization from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) to participate in the rollout of vaccines in far-flung provinces.
“Aside from our existing route network, we are committed to mount charter flights to provincial airports which can accommodate wide-body aircrafts such as the Airbus 320 to fast track vaccine distribution efforts,"" AirAsia Philippines CEO Ricky Isla said.AirAsia said its personnel have undergone technical training to properly handle temperature-sensitive vaccines in cargo.
The company also said it will ensure vaccines remain in sub-zero temperatures during flights to maintain their condition.
AirAsia will also use Teleport, its new door-to-door delivery for distribution.
Teleport covers delivery to 12 cities, namely: Bacolod, Cebu, General Santos, Iloilo, Kalibo, Puerto Princesa, Tacloban, Tagbilaran, Cagayan de Oro and Zamboanga.Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the country will get around 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the global alliance COVAX Facility in the first quarter, including 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine expected to arrive by the third week of February.RELATED VIDEO

MANILA - Designated COVID-19 hospitals in Metro Manila will be the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines that are set to arrive in the country next week, a Department of Health official (DOH) said Monday.
The Metro Manila Center for Health Development chief Dr. Corazon Flores these hospitals include Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Tala, Caloocan; Philippine General Hospital in Manila; and the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City. The National Kidney Transplant Institute's inclusion has yet to be finalized.
Flores said their top priority will be 4,557 employees and health workers from PGH, 1,900 in Tala hospital, and 1,117 from the Lung Center. She mentioned no specific figures yet for the rest of the hospitals.
“Ongoing po yung uploading ng data sa COVID electronic information registry,” she told ABS-CBN News.
Metro Manila has about 104,000 health workers in both government and private hospitals, to include clinics and other health facilities, according to DOH-MMCHD’s data.
“Siyempre, pagdating ng vaccine, dadaan pa sa RITM (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine), FDA (Food and Drug Administration), ita-transport pa 'yan sa hospital kaya hindi po natin mai-specific ang date (pag bakuna), but tentatively we have to prepare by next week,” she said.
For the Tala Hospital, Flores said that its nurses, doctors and other employees, like the security and maintenance staff, whether contractual or permanent employees, are all listed as priority for the vaccine.
While the taking the COVID shot is voluntary, Flores said the DOH will continue to enlighten health workers of the importance and benefit of the vaccine through town hall meetings in hospitals.
“Yung iba kasi na tumatanggi eh, namimili ng vaccine. 'Yan naman po naririnig natin, kaya po we are continuously giving the education campaign, information drive, even sa hospital para ma-clarify,” she said.
“Kailangan makinig tayo sa information, we ensure that the vaccine will be given are of quality and pumasa sa FDA natin,"" she added.
The hospitals have also already conducted their simulation of the vaccination process, Flores said. She suggested having a proper schedule and contingency plan as most hospital workers are expected to get back to work right after taking the vaccine.
“Let's say we have 10 health workers, there pwedeng tatlo muna ngayon, tomorrow 'yung another 3, then next day another 3 para hindi lang mawalan ng naka duty doon sa ward,” she said.
In recent weeks the government’s Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) team has made rounds in different cities in Metro Manila to evaluate masterlists, microplans and the mapping of vaccination sites and preparedness of vaccination teams and cold storage facilities.
“Sa atin pong publiko, ito na po hinihintay natin para tayo maproteksyunan, tayo magpabakuna para sa COVID-19,"" Flores urged.
Vaccine Czar Sec. Carlito Galvez earlier said the government targets 50-70 million Filipinos will be inoculated by the end of 2021.

Duterte made the appeal as the country prepares for the rollout of its COVID-19 vaccination program.
""We might be issue this appeal, not a warning. I am appealing to the Communist Party of the Philippines... the Communist Party of the Philippines must guarantee that the vaccines, in the course of they're being transported to areas where there are no city health officers or medical person, na huwag ninyong galawin ang medisina (do not touch the medicines),"" he said during his weekly public briefing.
""Allow the vaccines to be transported freely and safely. I am asking you now to observe that rule because that is for the Filipino people,"" Duterte added, saying the CPP should follow the ""rules of humanity.""
He also told government officials not to hamper or obstruct the system of vaccine transportation and delivery.
""May I just address myself to every government worker...do not delay or do not hinder, do not obstruct the smooth flow na nakikita ninyo ngayon, from the time of the arrival, to the time of clearance,"" he said.
""Ang trabaho lang ninyo sa Customs is magtingin. You have no business na buksan-buksan 'yan. You are not allowed to do that. I am not allowing anybody, anybody there sa airport na magbukas bukas,"" Duterte warned airport and Bureau of Customs employees.

Under House Bill 8558, the country’s efforts towards disease prevention will be enhanced by expanding the mandatory immunization program for all life stages.
The list of mandatory vaccine preventable diseases include tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella or German measles, hepatitis b, human influenza type b, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, human papilloma virus and booster for measles, and rubella tetanus.
The proposed law mandates the provision of the vaccine in government hospitals or facilities, any public school or community under its school-based or community-based immunization program, and in any private health facility.
The office of House Health Committee Chair Rep. Angelina “Helen” Tan said in a statement that the bill will repeal Republic Act 10152, otherwise known as the “Mandatory Infants and Children Immunization Act of 2011”, including the list of diseases covered by the national immunization program.
The measure will also include other types of vaccine-preventable diseases as may be determined by the Secretary of Health upon the recommendation of the National Immunization Technical and Advisory Group (NITAG) and after a separate or joint public hearing conducted by the health panels of Congress.
The bill, principally authored by Tan, mandates the Department of Health (DOH) to conduct massive and continuing education and information campaigns on the importance of giving basic immunization in light of the controversy surrounding the dengue vaccine that had somehow tainted the credibility of the government’s immunization program.
“The timing for the approval of this significant health measure cannot be more perfect as the country is looking forward toward the introduction of COVID-19 vaccine, which is likely to become available in the country anytime soon. I am certain that this health legislation will pave the way for a more relevant, responsive, and reinvigorated immunization program that all Filipinos so badly needs at this point,” Tan said.
The bill will be sent to the Senate for action.

MANILA — The Philippines is ready to launch its COVID-19 vaccination drive next week, Malacañang said on Monday, as the country awaited its supply of doses.
The country's first COVID-19 vaccine batch will arrive in ""mid-February"" from the COVAX Facility, which seeks to ensure equitable access to the drug, said Palace spokesman Harry Roque.""Ilang tulog na lang, mga kaibigan, at dadating na ang unang batch ng ating bakuna.

MANILA - Some 116,000 health workers in Metro Manila have been initially listed for COVID-19 vaccination, the Department of Health said Friday, as the agency finalizes its master list of eligible recipients.
Dr. Razel Nikka Hao, deputy to the COVID-19 surveillance and quick action unit of DOH, said the data came from submissions of different health facilities in the Philippine capital, which is the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis.
""At this point, we are in the process of master listing for group A1 or all of the workers in the frontline health-care services,"" she said in a press briefing.
""As early as January of this year, we have reached out to the facilities and the local governments who will encompass this group A1.""
In the government's vaccination plan, health workers shall first receive the COVID-19 jabs. They are followed by older people, persons with comorbidities or underlying conditions, other essential workers, including uniformed personnel, and indigent population -- all in group A.
Next in the priority list is group B, which are other frontline workers and special population. The remaining population or group C is at the bottom of the pile.
Hao said the number of eligible health workers may also change as health facilities were in the process of profiling their staff.

Meanwhile, master listing of other priority groups will come in the next coming months, she said.
""They are still in the process of going through each of their staff to find out who have comorbidities or have exclusion,"" Hao added.
The health agency is already coordinating with the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other groups for an initial list of older people and indigents.
Masterlist of health workers who will receive COVID-19 vaccine to be finalized by Feb. 15
The DOH earlier said it was set to finalize by Feb. 15 the list of health workers who will be prioritized in the government’s massive inoculation program. It plans to start immunization this month.
Anti-coronavirus vaccine developed by US drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech will most likely be used to inoculate the health workers, the Food and Drug Administration said Thursday.

Duterte initially said he will be the first to be inoculated in the Philippines in public, to prove the vaccine that will be distributed to Filipinos will be safe.

""The development program will begin immediately, with the target of introducing the vaccine in 2022, subject to regulatory approval,"" a joint statement said.
GSK will also support the manufacture this year of up to 100 million doses of CureVac's first generation COVID-19 vaccine, it added.
The collaboration, building on an existing relationship, is to develop next generation COVID-19 vaccines ""with the potential for a multi-valent approach to address multiple emerging variants in one vaccine"".

UK vaccine rollout passes 10 million in ‘milestone’, says PM
A more contagious COVID-19 variant first spotted in Britain has spread across the globe, according to the World Health Organization.
Another variant, detected initially in South Africa, has raised greater alarm among researchers over its possible impact on immunity.
The coronavirus has killed more than 2.2 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to an AFP tally based on official sources.
More than 100 million vaccines have meanwhile been given around the world but none of the world's 29 poorest countries has formally started mass inoculations.
Separately on Wednesday, GSK revealed that net profits soared by almost a quarter last year on the back of divestments.
Profit after taxation jumped 24 percent to £5.7 billion ($7.8 billion, 6.5 billion euros) in 2020 from a year earlier, GSK said in a results statement.
Revenues however rose by just one percent to £34 billion, with vaccine sales hit as governments prioritized COVID-19 vaccines -- and more disruption expected in 2021.
""For our vaccines business, we now anticipate further disruption during the first half of the year, given governments' prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination programs and the resurgence in late 2020 of the pandemic,"" GSK noted.
""This is expected to impact adult and adolescent immunizations, including (shingles vaccine) Shingrix, notably in the United States.""

Mayor Marcy Teodoro showed NTF deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon the vaccination system the city plans to roll out, which gets rid of pre-registration processes, such as screenings for co-morbidities and allergies to be done on the barangay level.
“Napakaganda noon kasi ibig sabihin bibilis ang proseso at hindi masyadong mabibilaukan ang pila. At ang isa pang maganda dito, open, mas hindi prone sa transmission. Kapag open air hindi kamukha ng iba na air-conditioned at hindi kalakahin ang area, madali i-expand and napaka-organized,” Dizon said.

Teodoro said that besides the city’s sports center there will be 9 other vaccination centers at schools as they target 10,000 daily inoculations.
The vaccination process will start with the registration of pre-screened individuals, actual vaccination and observation if they will exhibit adverse reactions.
Following the national guidelines, frontliners in Marikina hospitals will be the first to receive the vaccines that will come from national government.
Teodoro said the city’s own vaccine procurement will arrive in the third quarter of the year, adding an indemnification fund will be set aside by the city government.
“Initially meron kaming P5 (million) to P6 million. Ito 'yung for financial and medical assistance kung sakaling magkaroon ng adverse reaction, kasi kailangan din para sa tiwala ng tao. Alam niya pag magkasakit siya meron siya maaasahan na pondo or budget,” Teodoro said.
Marikina residents who participated in the simulation activity said they were looking forward to their actual vaccination against COVID-19.
“Mas maganda po totohanan na ibigay na vaccine, mas protektado ang bawat tao at least may panlaban na sa virus ang bayan ng Marikina, maging COVID-free kami,” said resident Lyma Rico.

It is expected to last for a week.The city listed 7,500 healthcare workers, and 25,000 non-HCWs in the priority list based on the national guidelines.Vaccine rollout had also started on Monday, March 8, in other provinces in the Davao Region such as Davao del Norte, Davao de Oro, and Davao Oriental.",sunstar

Some private hospitals in Cebu have started vaccinating their healthcare workers with CoronaVac, a vaccine developed by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech Ltd., that was provided by the National Government.The first private hospital in Cebu to vaccinate its frontline workers was the Cebu City branch of Chong Hua Hospital (CHH) on Monday, March 8.CHH was allocated more than 3,500 doses of CoronaVac by the DOH 7, and the hospital already started its initial rollout on Monday with 160 frontliners vaccinated. The vaccination of frontliners continued on Tuesday, March 9.On Tuesday, March 9, other private hospitals, Perpetual Succour Hospital and Cebu Doctors’ University-Hospital (CDUH), also inoculated medical frontliners and other vital staff members from their administration, maintenance and security.Loreche said CHH Cebu City has an allocation of 2,468 CoronaVac doses; CHH Mandaue City, 1,111; CDUH or CebuDoc, 1,585; Cebu South General Hospital (SouthGen), 414; Cebu North General Hospital (NorthGen), 364; and Mactan Doctors’ Hospital (MactanDoc), 560. CebuDoc, MactanDoc, NorthGen and SouthGen are part of the CebuDoc Group.Around 70 percent of the CHH staff, including doctors, nurses, maintenance, security and other support staff, agreed to be vaccinated with CoronaVac. As of 3:30 p.m., 245 CebuDoc Group health workers had been vaccinated and only two experienced adverse effects.Positive response
Dr. Faith Villanueva, an infectious disease specialist and head of CHH’s head of Covid-19 vaccination task group, described the turnout as a positive response and a boost of confidence to the country’s ongoing nationwide vaccination program.CebuDoc Group also started its vaccination program against Covid-19 on its healthcare workers on Tuesday, with a ceremonial vaccination held at the CebuDoc Group Vaccination Center located at the parking area of Medical Arts Building 1.Dr. Potenciano “Yong” Larrazabal III, president and chairman of the board, received the first dose of CoronaVac to kick off the vaccination rollout in CebuDoc Group and to boost the confidence of CebuDoc Group Healthcare workers in the vaccine.“Vaccination is the way to go if we want to attain herd immunity,” he said in a press statement, adding, “I believe the best vaccine is the first vaccine on hand.”The Covid-19 vaccine recipients will be given two doses. They will also undergo a six-step process—registration, orientation, assessment, actual vaccination, post-vaccination monitoring, and post-vaccination documentation.For the first batch, 1,460 out of the nearly 3,000 healthcare workers of CebuDoc Group are expected to get vaccinated from March 9 to 12, 2021. They will receive the second dose after a month.“This is just the beginning. Once all our frontliners are already inoculated, we also hope to roll out our supplementary vaccination for our family members. We will also be extending assistance to the different LGUs (local government units) in Cebu for the vaccination of the Cebuanos,” Larrazabal said.Sinovac’s CoronaVac is the third Covid-19 vaccine brand to be approved for emergency use after Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.Larrazabal said they are ready for future mass vaccination programs.“We have systems in place. Our team is ready to do the mass vaccination once the LGUs and other sectors start tapping us to administer their vaccination,” he said.At Perpetual Succour Hospital (PSH) in Cebu City, 120 of its employees—doctors (70 percent), and nurses, allied health professionals and security personnel (30 percent)—were inoculated with CoronaVac during its rollout of the vaccination Tuesday.The CoronaVac will be administered to health workers who are 18 years old up to 59 years old; however, PSH will allow health workers above 60 years old to be vaccinated as long as they sign a waiver, said Dr. Elrey Inocian, head of the PSH vaccination team.On Tuesday, PSH medical professionals Dr. Fe Marie Perez, 62, and her husband Dr. Monico Perez, 63, were vaccinated with CoronaVac.Monico said they have friends in Hong Kong who were vaccinated with CoronaVac who told them that there is no age qualification to get the vaccine.Monico and his wife decided to get inoculated because it is better to feel the adverse effects than to get infected with Covid-19.Dr. Ian Teodorico, an allergy specialist and head of the post-vaccination and monitoring team of PSH, was one of the doctors vaccinated at Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC).Teodorico has a history of allergic rhinitis, severe atopic and allergic reactions to crabs. Despite his condition, he did not feel any adverse effects after he was vaccinated.He said being allergic to food or medicine is not a contraindication against the vaccine as it has different components. So, he said, there is no need to be afraid of getting vaccinated since there is a specialist who will monitor the recipient’s condition.After the vaccination, the recipient will have to be monitored on-site for 30 minutes to an hour, then they are advised to go home and rest.Teodorico said they will continue to monitor the condition of the recipients for the next four hours for any adverse effects.He said the adverse effects will only last one to three days, and the easy remedy includes taking paracetamol and other pain relievers.More than 50 percent of PSH health workers, or nearly 600 out of 1,107 employees, agreed to be inoculated. The hospital’s first vaccination rollout will end on Sunday, March 14.The rest of the PSH medical workers who chose not to get CoronaVac jabs said they will wait for the other vaccine brands to arrive, said Inocian.Recipients
Loreche said 12 private and public hospitals in Central Visayas already received the CoronaVac doses allocated for them, while 28 medical institutions are set to receive their vaccines.As of March 9, a total of 1,904 VSMMC health workers had been vaccinated. Of the number, 52 experienced adverse effects.Some of the adverse effects felt by the vaccine recipients were lightheadedness, dizziness, feeling tired, numbness at the injection site, itching, hypertension, headache and fainting.In Bohol, a total of 277 medical workers at Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital have been vaccinated since March 5.Also on Tuesday, the vaccination at Lapu-Lapu City Hospital started, and the first recipient was its administrator, Dr. Ronald Oporto. Mayor Junard Chan attended the event, but he was not inoculated as the medical frontliners are prioritized to receive the CoronaVac jabs.Oporto said 102 hospital personnel will be vaccinated in the next three days.Teachers encouraged
At the Department of Education in Cebu, Dr. Marilyn Andales, Cebu Province Schools Division superintendent, urged her fellow teachers to get inoculated if it is already time for their vaccination.There were teachers who agreed to get the vaccine.However, Andales said there were teachers who feared the Covid-19 vaccine would cause them to fall ill, while others said they would choose not to receive the vaccine because they have pre-existing illnesses.

It’s better than zero protection. The recipient will be given two doses of Sinovac vaccine. If you are vaccinated in any four types of the vaccines available in the world now, will not prevent you from being infected but it will just prevent you from going into moderate and severe infection. It will now lessen the admission of Covid-19 related symptoms,” Drilon said.He said they will start the vaccination for their staff Tuesday, with 150 healthcare workers a day. They are hopeful to finish the Covid-19 vaccination within four to five days.If they cannot use all the supplied Sinovac vaccine, he added that the Department of Health (DOH) has a guideline on what to do with the excess vaccine for a proper accounting.“I encourage everybody, my fellow healthcare workers, to have yourself vaccinated because it’s a responsibility to yourself, family and to your community. We have enough doses to accommodate everyone who is willing to be vaccinated,” Drilon said.For her part, Cerrada said she is happy and proud to be able to protect herself, her family and patients.Cerrada urged the public to have themselves vaccinated, which is a privilege for everyone because the vaccine is given for free, as she underscored the need for the public to develop herd immunity that can only be achieved if many of the population will be vaccinated.“We have had everything -- distancing face shield, facemask -- everything, but it’s still there.

It seems reasonable to be skeptical of such hastily produced vaccines which normally would take years to develop and produce.Major pharmaceutical companies have been transparent to a certain extent as to the different unique types and underlying pharmacological details and chemical structures. There may be some reason to be both wary and optimistic for such developments.While this pandemic has been unprecedented, what is clear is how there would be eager opportunists ready to capitalize on such a crisis. A select group of people stand to benefit much from this pandemic and we can only hope that they opt to do the right thing when it comes to critical decisions which primarily happen behind closed doors. We can but hope for morality to overrule a profiteering agenda detrimental to the common good. It is truly hard to discern what is truly taking place in actuality.A fluctuating reinforcement of public protocols and more swab test mandates have added more burden to our pockets. It has been an absolutely distressful reality which has crippled a big chunk of our lives. And it does not appear the virus is slowing down anytime soon given the many spikes that come and go.While I do not mean to cast doubt on the vaccines to get the ball rolling and get the economy revitalized, there may be some validity in expressing doubt given the prevalent news reports regarding side effects and negative implications from early trials. It is understandable to be fearful of something completely unparalleled.However, given the surge in cases of the so-called new strain which seem to spread more quickly, the government is eager to speed up the vaccine rollouts of the different major companies. Many different vaccine types have each with its own sets of pros and cons. It may be essential to make a sound and rational choice as to what solutions and options are best for our close relationships.We can only but brace ourselves in such uncertain times on what is still yet to come, but there is a need to stay resilient regardless of any outcome. But what is blatantly clear is how we cannot endure any more lockdowns and how there is a need for a better trajectory this year considering how we have become more educated on the virus. It is time to gain momentum and get back on track. There is nowhere else to go but up.",sunstar

We remain committed to making our vaccine available on every continent to help end this global pandemic,” she added.About the vaccineThe Covid-19 Vaccine Moderna (referred to in the U.S. as the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine) is an mRNA vaccine against Covid-19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the Spike (S) protein, which was co-developed by Moderna and investigators from NIAID’s Vaccine Research Center.The first clinical batch, which was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, was completed on February 7, 2020 and underwent analytical testing. It was shipped to the NIH on February 24, 42 days from sequence selection.The first participant in the NIAID-led Phase 1 study of the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine was dosed on March 16, 63 days from sequence selection to Phase 1 study dosing.On May 12, the U.S Food and Drug Administration granted the Moderna Covid-19 Vaccine Fast Track designation.On May 29, the first participants in each age cohort: adults ages 18-55 years (n=300) and older adults ages 55 years and above (n=300) were dosed in the Phase 2 study of the vaccine.

Recto and Virgen Delos Remedios on March 4.City Chief Adviser and Tactician IC Calaguas, who spearheaded the survey in the three barangays, said most locals were either hesitant to participate in the survey, afraid to take the vaccine, or prefer a specific brand of vaccine.“It is difficult for us to make plans for the inoculation of Covid-19 vaccines if we do not have any data,” Calaguas said.Calaguas furthered Lazatin’s appeal to participate in the survey, saying data collected will help the city government make plans for seamless mass vaccination.“Through the survey, we will be able to identify and prioritize those who want to receive the vaccine,” she said.Part of the queries needed in the survey are basic information including number of persons in the household; preferred vaccine; and health conditions including allergies, comorbidities, and if the person had been afflicted with Covid-19.The city government has earlier put up a database center where survey forms collected are inscribed by 12 encoders.Calaguas said they have 150 surveyors for house-to-house surveys apart from the online survey they have earlier launched. She added that they plan to complete the survey in April.The city has a total population of 411,634.To abate Angeleños concerns about the vaccines, Lazatin will receive the vaccine first along with other city officials and health workers.Surveyors have started visiting hospitals and medical clinics in the city since the guidelines set by the national government states that they shall be prioritized to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.It can be recalled that Lazatin has ramped up the city’s vaccination plan, as he ordered the creation of a working committee in anticipation of the procurement and arrival of the Covid-19 vaccines.Lazatin has tapped Calaguas to form and supervise all working committees for the mass inoculation.The city government is also in the process of securing a P600-million loan for the procurement of the vaccines.In January, the city received a favorable endorsement from the officials of the Development Bank of the Philippines in regard to its P600-million loan.",sunstar

So why haven’t we signed a deal with any of the vaccine manufacturers until now?It is false to assert that we are not in any worse position than the other local government units in the race to acquire the vaccine. The cities of Bacolod, Quezon, Davao, Baguio, Manila and Iloilo and a few smaller cities, among others, have already signed tripartite and non-disclosure agreements with the national government and AstraZeneca. Some may have already made advance payments as authorized by President Duterte.But at least we’re moving now. Last week, the council met with representatives of two vaccine manufacturers. A few days later, they authorized Mayor Edgar Labella to negotiate the acquisition of P200 million worth of vaccines. The quantity is not enough to immunize the city’s nearly one million population or at least that portion that would enhance herd immunity, but it’s a good start. Even one shot is better than none at all.Maybe, city officials are counting on the national government to provide the balance. Indeed, why spend for something that you can obtain free? The P200 million savings can be re-programmed for other services.Not everyone will take the vaccine anyway. There are many of them who have probably been influenced by all the disinformation being peddled in the Internet or traumatized by our experience with Dengvaxia or have not outgrown their fear of injection, which is unfortunate.In a column she wrote for the Washington Post yesterday, American book author, CNN analyst and former Baltimore Health Commissioner Leana Wen cited the need for health authorities to fully explain the significance of vaccination. Is it a free pass to travel? Can they revert to their old lifestyles, no more wearing of masks and no more physical distancing?So far, Dr. Wen said, what has been made clear is that starting 14 days, after a person has received his second dose of the vaccine, he does not have to quarantine anymore even if he was exposed to someone with Covid-19.“After all, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic illness and nearly 100 percent at preventing severe disease. These are astounding results,” Dr. Wen, who was born in Shanghai, China, said, “and essentially mean that Covid-19 in a vaccinated person is no worse than a bad cold or a flu.”Compare that to the situation of the unvaccinated. He runs the risk of becoming seriously ill and even dying from Covid-19. If he’s working, he cannot transmit the disease to his co-employees who have been vaccinated but may get the coronavirus from the latter since “the research is not definitive on whether vaccinated people can transmit Covid-19,” according to Dr. Wen.To be vaccinated or not to be vaccinated, that is the question. Life is a matter of choices, someone wiser once wrote, and sometimes there are no second chances.",sunstar

Yumang said the available vaccines can inoculate a total of 16,800 healthcare workers in the region.""They will receive two doses of CoronaVac, with a 28-day interval from the first dose,"" she said.In Davao Region, apart from SPMC, the vaccination activity will also be rolled out to other provinces, depending on the readiness of the different Local Government Units' implementing sites.Yumang said the vaccination in Davao de Oro and Davao Regional Medical Center (DRMC) in Tagum City, Davao del Norte will start on March 8.""From the regional office, ang vaccine i-tratravel po siya doon sa kanya kanyang provincial health offices,"" Yumang said.She said based on the survey they conducted, 79 percent of DRMC's employees are willing to be vaccinated.Yumang added that they are still collecting data as to the vaccine acceptance of the other provinces.To allay fears of the public and fellow frontliners, SPMC officer -in-charge Dr. Ricardo Audan volunteered to be the first health worker inoculated with CoronaVac.""I know many of you are still scared to be vaccinated. That is why I am volunteering myself to assure and show everyone that this is safe and effective. Disregard your fears and doubts now and let's unite to end the pandemic,"" he said on Friday, minutes before he got his jab, which was personally inoculated by DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III.Frontliners' experiencesAfter Audan, 149 more health workers from SPMC received the vaccine on the first day of rollout.""The goal is to inoculate 150 employees a day. We initially target to finish the vaccination for the first dose for 12 days but we were told to double time and committed to doing it in five days or a week,"" Audan said.One of the first four health frontliners who received the vaccine is Dr. Almera Manan, an Internal Medicine resident in SPMC for three years. She was one of the thousands of medical workers who contracted the virus while on duty. She got infected in April last year and recovered in the same month.""I was afraid before when I tested positive for Covid-19 because we only know a little about the virus back then. But now, I have no second thoughts of receiving the vaccine because this is our best defense against the virus,"" she told SunStar Davao in an interview while she was still under monitoring for 30 minutes after the inoculation.All vaccine recipients were mandated to stay in a designated observation area for 30 minutes to check if they feel any adverse effects caused by the vaccine.She emphasized that it is her personal choice to be inoculated and nobody forced her to receive it.For Dr. Edmundo Visitacion Jr., a pathologist and regular consultant at SPMC, getting the vaccine is the best protection an individual can have in the long run.""Since I am a doctor, I know that only vaccines can give us protection in the long run. If we don't have a vaccine, the possibility of getting Covid-19 is still high,"" he said.He also added that the vaccine administrators secured their informed consent and that they underwent a health screening to ensure that those who will be vaccinated are eligible.Infectious disease specialist Dr. Marie Yvette C. Barez also shared she felt completely normal after getting her CoronaVac jab.""I am okay. I do not feel anything weird or bad. As an infectious disease specialist, it is my responsibility to protect myself, family, and even the community. Having the vaccine will protect the people,"" she said, adding her daily exposure to the virus makes her even more willing to get vaccinated.""Vaccine has always been there to prevent the infection. Even before, we already have vaccines, it is just that this is a new virus. We have been receiving vaccines against measles, flu, etc., so why are we afraid of this vaccine?"" she added.She also reminded those who received the vaccine to still observe and maintain health protocols as the majority of the population is still not inoculated.Meanwhile, for a 33-year-old SPMC nurse Jon Rey V. Estuya, the arrival of the vaccine is a ray of hope, especially for frontliners.""I've been in the fight against Covid-19 for a year now, and I'm lucky enough to not contract the virus. But the daily fear is always there. With the vaccine, the anxiety and fear we feel every day were lowered, we are now more hopeful that there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said.Estuya has been an SPMC employee for a decade now.For a health worker who is dealing with Covid-19 cases daily, Estuya shared that getting a jab is what he has been hoping for months since the start of the pandemic.""Daily, I am dealing with Covid-19 cases, even with the PPE on, I am still afraid, not just for myself but more on the possibility of bringing the virus to my home where my senior citizen parents and pregnant wife are,"" he shared.""Nalipay gyud ko na naabot na ang vaccine (I am happy that the vaccine has finally arrived here). And if ever I'll test positive for Cvid-19 - God forbids - at least, with the vaccine, I won't be a severe or critical case,"" he said.Vaccination campaignTo further raise awareness about the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, the Presidential Communications Operations Office-Office of the Global Media and Public Affairs (PCOO-OGMPA) launched on March 3, a series of explainer videos dubbed ""The VAXplainer.""""The VAXplainer is only a part of our numerous efforts and commitment to make Filipinos fully understand the importance of vaccines and convince them to be inoculated with the available safe and effective vaccines provided by the government,"" PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar said in a press statement.The first episode of the VAXplainer focuses on the personal experience of Philippine Ambassador to Bahrain Alfonso Ver in getting vaccinated during the first phase of Bahrain's vaccination program from December 2020 to January 2021.""The VAXplainer"" can be viewed on PTV and IBC-13. It will also be live-streamed on the PCOO, National Task Force Against Covid-19, and Department of Health Facebook pages, as well as other government-affiliated social media pages.In Mati City, Davao Oriental, the city government conducted a three-day information dissemination campaign on Covid-19 vaccination on March 3-5.The city has already identified 24,000 individuals as priority for the vaccination. The list includes 400 health workers, other frontliners, senior citizens, and families in the lowest income bracket.",sunstar

After several weeks of hope and anticipation, the much-touted Covid-19 vaccines to shield humanity against the worldwide pandemic are slowly trickling in and reaching the shores of our country.Just this Thursday here in the city the Department of Health/Center for Health Development-Cordillera Administrative Region received its share of 7,800 doses of the Sinovac Covid-19 vaccines to be distributed to the various hospital facilities in the Cordillera Region. And just the other day, Friday, a ceremonial vaccination program was conducted at the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC) park with no less than its Medical Center Chief, Dr. Ricardo B. Ruñez, along with other volunteer rank and file employees of the hospital being the first recipients of the said vaccine.The 7,800 doses of the vaccine shared to the region come from the first batch of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac Biotech CoronaVac which arrived in the country last Sunday from China. The national government has immediately begun distributing the said vaccines to the various hospitals as well as conducting a ceremonial inoculation in Manila with nurses and doctors, as well as several top government officials, being the recipients.Apart from the arrival of the vaccines from China, the country also received last Thursday, 487,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine thru the Covax facility, a global initiative aimed at equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines led by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and others, and which will be distributed again to the various hospitals the next day, according to the country’s testing czar Vince Dizon, President of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA).So this is where we stand at the moment. Here in the City of Baguio the Punong Barangays recently had a meeting where the Health Services Office (HSO) of the city government thru Dra. Weng Galpo and Dra. Cecilia Brilliantes once again reiterated the necessity of fast-tracking the listing of residents of the city for the scheduled vaccination program in the locality.In that meeting, it came to the observation of the concerned Barangay Officials, more particularly LIGA President and ex-oficio City Councilor Michael Lawana that in the list of priority population groups identified by the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNiTAG) for vaccination it would appear they (Barangay Officials) have not been listed either in priority A1, A2, A3 which include among others barangay health workers, janitors, nursing aides, and students.Councilor Lawana pointed out that Barangay Officials who remain at the frontlines almost 24/7 in the communities where they serve should also be given the highest priority in the list of priority population groups for vaccination.For better appreciation of this observation here is the full list of priority population groups for vaccination as identified by iNiTAG: A1: Frontline workers in health facilities both national and local, private and public, health professionals and non-professionals like students, nursing aides, janitors, barangay health workers, etc. A2: Senior citizens aged 60 years old and above; A3: Persons with comorbidities not otherwise included in the preceding categories; A4: Frontline personnel in essential sectors including uniformed personnel and those in working sectors identified by the IATF as essential during the Enhanced Community Quarantine; A5: Indigent population not otherwise included in the preceding categories; B1: Teachers, Social workers; B2: Other government workers; B3: Other essential workers; B4: Socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigenous people; B5: Overseas Filipino Workers; B6: Other remaining workforce; C: Rest of the Filipino population not otherwise included in the above groups.Apparently, this must be rectified by the iNiTAG so that it will accurately reflect the status of Barangay Officials as vital frontliners who should also be given top priority in the said vaccination list.",sunstar

Many companies have signed up and taken part in the reservation of the vaccines,” he said.He noted companies are still waiting for the actual delivery dates amid pending suppliers’ documentation and authorization.“All these companies that ordered the doses are for their employees’ use. With the arrival of Sinovac, we hope this will signal for other vaccines to come also. The sooner, the better,” he said.At least 7,200 Sinovac doses were transported to Cebu via a Philippine Airlines flight on Tuesday, March 2, 2021.Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) president Steven Yu said more than 100 companies have signed up for private initiatives to secure Covid-19 vaccines.“Aside from the big companies who joined the ‘A Dose Of Hope’ of Secretary Concepcion, the MCCI is probably one of the few lead business groups that partnered with International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICTSI) in procuring Moderna vaccines for its member and affiliate companies,” he said.While the MCCI has secured a firm allocation from ICTSI, ICTSI has yet to sign the tripartite agreement with Moderna in relation to the concerned allocation.“These are purely non-profit and corporate social responsibility endeavors of the MCCI. These are the updates as of this writing. ICTSI is firm on its commitment to help vaccinate the Philippine population, and help the country attain herd immunity. As they say, ‘No one is safe until everyone is safe,’” he said.Yu said they can’t reveal how many doses are in the process of being procured due to confidentiality agreements. But he noted that companies, big and small combined, are willing to procure at least 100,000 doses for their employees.Filipino Cebuano Business Club chairman Rey Calooy, on the other hand, said they will wait for the government to procure more vaccines.“We will stay posted for any advisories coming from the government because we know that the process must be authorized by them first,” he said.Voluntary, highly encouragedMeanwhile, the business leaders said it is up to the employees if they will participate in their company’s vaccination program.But they said it is highly encouraged.“It’s the employees’ decision. I would suggest that employees take the vaccines because companies are really investing in employee training and others,” Taguiam said.He said part of the process is to make sure that all are vaccinated to protect each other in the workplace so the economy can keep on going.Yu said they already informed their members that vaccination should be voluntary.“We, in MCCI, have informed our members that vaccination is voluntary, and minimum health protocols should still be followed. They are free and encouraged to do information awareness to their employees on the positive effects of the vaccine,” he said.Calooy also said vaccination remains voluntary and not mandatory, adding that it is up to the employees to weigh the pros and cons of having themselves vaccinated against Covid-19.",sunstar

They are in the priority list of the Covid-19 vaccine recipients.Based on the list submitted by EOC to the Department of Health (DOH)-Western Visayas, it showed that about 18,000 medical workers assigned in CLMMRH and Riverside Medical Center need to be vaccinated.""This is only the first batch of vaccines intended for our healthcare workers and frontliners,"" Sorongon said.If all Sinovac vaccines will not be used, he said the remaining vaccines will be used to the medical frontliners from Level-1 and 2 hospitals in Bacolod City.EOC on Thursday held training with five other hospital personnel at the Bacolod Government Center for Covid-19 vaccine.On March 7, the EOC will also hold a ceremonial vaccination at the Bacolod Government Center and it will be participated by some personalities in Bacolod City including the city officials.""It's voluntary and it's never mandatory, but we are hoping and praying that all our healthcare workers will avail this vaccine,"" Sorongon said.He said the City Government also intensified its information and education campaign in various barangays.""Let's grab this opportunity to protect our fellow Bacolodnons.

It will be a moral obligation for us,” he said.“We are asking all our leaders na kung puwede i-dedicate muna natin sa healthcare workers ito pong AstraZeneca at saka Sinovaac considering na tapusin muna natin yung healthcare workers at senior citizens,” he added.Beverly Ho, DOH director for Promotion and Communication Service, cited the finding of focus group discussions (FGD) and social media posts that the public confidence in vaccines is likely to increase after they see officials get it first.“The FGD just showed na ito ‘yung gusto nilang makita na, ‘Ah, actually even leaders pala gagawin. Mauna kayo bago kami.’ That’s actually the narrative we see in social media so that’s also what we’ve gotten from the FGDs,” she said in a virtual press briefing.She said, however, that the health workers should still be inoculated first because of the limited supply.

State television PTV reported that the aircraft arrived at 7:10 p.m. Thursday at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. After unloading passengers and other cargoes, the aircraft will be towed to the Villamor Air Base, where President Rodrigo Duterte was expected to lead the welcome ceremony.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, in a press briefing earlier Thursday in Cebu City, said healthcare workers will still be given priority in getting the AZ vaccines. The country’s 1.7 million healthcare workers need a total of 3.4 million doses.With the arrival of the AZ shipment, which consists of 487,200 doses, the Philippines has received a total of 1.087 million doses.The AZ vaccine is the second to reach the Philippines after the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine donated by China, which arrived on February 28.It is the first batch of the 4.7 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines that the Philippines is programmed to receive under the first round of Covax allocations.A list of the allocations released on March 2 by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, which co-leads Covax, showed that the Philippines was allocated a total of 4.584 million doses of the AZ vaccine and 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.The Philippines is among the 92 low and middle income economies that are eligible to participate in the Covax advance market commitment (AMC) mechanism. Higher income countries that have signed up with the Covax facility are self-financing participants.Dr. Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, explained that the Covax AMC is largely funded through official development assistance (ODA) as well as contributions from the private sector and philanthropists.“Even so, it is likely that the 92 ODA-eligible countries accessing vaccines through the Covax AMC may also be required to share some of the costs of Covid-19 vaccines and delivery,” Berkley said.Delivery of the vaccines to AMC participants depend on submission of “national regulatory requirements” as well as “availability of supply and fulfillment of other criteria such as validated national deployment and vaccination plans from AMC participants, indemnification and liability agreements, and export and import authorizations.”DeliveriesOther Southeast Asian countries that have received Covax vaccines as of March 4 are South Korea and Cambodia.South Korea, as a self-financing participant in the Covax facility, received 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on February 26, while Cambodia, which is also eligible for the Covax AMC like the Philippines, received 324,000 doses of the AZ vaccine on March 2.Covax managing director Aurelia Nguyen, in a Twitter post on March 3, said over 10 million doses have been delivered to 15 countries in just over a week.“This is a momentous milestone on the long journey to equitable vaccine access and the deliveries have only just begun,” she stated.Covax kicked off its global vaccine rollout on February 24 with a shipment to Ghana, the first outside India, where the AZ vaccines are manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII).The countries that received Covax vaccines ahead of the Philippines are Ghana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Lesotho, Nigeria, Angola, Cambodia, South Korea, Colombia, Rwanda, Gambia, Cote d’Ivoire, India, Sudan and Senegal.A total of 237 million doses of AZ vaccine and 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine constitute the first round of Covax allocations for 142 countries, which are either self-financing or AMC participants.Delivery of these vaccines has been scheduled for February to May 2021, according to the list released by Gavi.Unicef Philippines, in a social media post Thursday, March 4, said the goal of the Covax facility is to deliver at least 1.3 billion doses to the 92 eligible economies, including the Philippines, this year.The AZ vaccine is allowed for emergency use in the Philippines as the Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) on January 28, 2021.Other EUAs were granted for the Pfizer vaccine on January 14 and Sinovac vaccine on February 22.The Philippines kicked off its vaccination program against Covid-19 on March 1, a day after the Sinovac vaccines arrived.

Maj. Gen. Melquiades Feliciano of the Inter-Agency Task Force Central Visayas, and Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, Department of Health (DOH) 7 spokesperson and chief pathologist, also received Sinovac’s vaccine.Cebu City Vice Mayor Michael Rama, Mandaue City Mayor Jonas Cortes, Lapu-Lapu City Mayor Junard Chan and Chinese Consulate-General Jia Li were present to witness the inoculations.“There was just a little pain on the injection, just like the ordinary vaccination. Other than that, they kept on monitoring my vital signs and BP (blood pressure) and it was okay,” Aquino said during the post- vaccination briefing.Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo of the Field Implementation and Coordination Team administered the vaccine on Aquino.For her part, Loreche said now that they have “shown the way,” they expected fellow healthcare workers, frontliners and Cebuanos to see that the Sinovac vaccine is really safe.“We believe that we have to have the vaccine as it is now because this the best vaccine that we have at this moment,” Loreche said.Loreche dedicated her voluntary vaccination with the Sinovac vaccine to the medical frontliners who have lost their lives in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.“I would always remember our fallen colleagues as they fought Covid with us,” she said.Around 50 to 70 VSMMC healthcare workers were scheduled to be vaccinated along with the hospital’s officials on March 4.Thereafter, the DOH 7 targets about 500 healthcare workers a day for vaccination in the coming days.Aquino said the inoculation of nurses and doctors at the Philippine General Hospital in Manila helped boost the confidence of the HCWs in VSMMC to have themselves vaccinated with the same Sinovac vaccine.The VSMMC received 7,200 doses of CoronaVac on Tuesday, March 2, the first batch of vaccines to reach the Visayas.Aquino said these will be enough to cover the second or last dose of the vaccine for the complete vaccination of priority medical frontliners.On the first day of the vaccine rollout on Thursday, 15 vaccinators were deployed by the VSMMC.Aquino said based on the guidelines, HCWs have the option to wait for their preferred vaccine brand without losing their priority status.But he said he hoped more VSMMC HCWs would trust and agree to be given CoronaVac in the coming days.Aquino said if some VSMMC health workers decline vaccination, the unused Sinovac vaccines intended for them will be forwarded to other government hospitals in the region.“I told the rest of the team of the hospital, maybe in the next third or fourth day, they can send it to whoever is on the list for vaccination,” Aquino said in a mix of Tagalog and English.
Order of priority
Those prioritized in the vaccinations are medical workers in hospitals catering to Covid-19 cases, followed by health workers in other hospitals and government-owned community-based primary care facilities.Next in line are those working in private healthcare facilities and institutions.As of March 2, 20 local government units (LGUs) in Central Visayas including the tri-cities of Cebu, Lapu Lapu and Mandaue, have created their Vaccination Operations Center (VOC) following a directive issued by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).The VOCs are tasked to prepare the masterlist of priority eligible vaccinees, existing human resources and the LGU’s needed personnel in the vaccination program.DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III who was expected to join the first vaccinations in Cebu on Thursday was unable to attend the ceremony due to the arrival of 487,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the country Thursday night.Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Central Visayas will have an allocation of the AstraZeneca vaccine; however, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group will still have to deliberate on the exact number of doses to be allocated to the priority sectors.
Postponed vaccinations
DOH 7 medical program coordinator Van Phillip Baton in an earlier presentation of the region’s Covid-19 vaccination plan during the first Regional Development Council 7 full council meeting for 2021, said there will be qualified individuals whose vaccination will be deferred depending on the assessment of a medical doctor.He said those manifesting Covid-19 symptoms on the day of their vaccination will have to be rescheduled until they are fully recovered.The symptoms include fever, chills, headache, cough, colds, sore throat, fatigue, weakness, loss of smell or taste, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and difficulty in breathing.Meanwhile, those with a history of exposure to a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 case in the past two weeks will also have to be deferred until after completion of the mandatory quarantine period.Those previously treated for Covid-19 in the past 90 days will also be rescheduled after 90 days, as well as those who received convalescent plasma or antibodies.HCWs who are pregnant in their first trimester will be vaccinated only after the first trimester, while those who received any other vaccines in the last two weeks will be rescheduled after completion of the two-week interval.Those inoculated with the Covid vaccine will be assessed 25 to 35 minutes after the vaccination for possible adverse effects.Available vaccines
Cebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella is willing to be vaccinated should the vaccine be made available to officials.“Kung ako la’y mosunod, magpabakuna ko oy (If I had a choice, I would want to be vaccinated),” Labella told reporters.Labella said he will also not mind if he will be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine, as this has been proven effective in other countries.The Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV) Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales said 8,400 doses of Sinovac will be delivered to Bohol while 1,200 doses will be sent to Negros Oriental on Friday, March 5.Gonzales said the doses will be delivered to the Gov. Celestino Gallares Memorial Hospital in Tagbilaran City, Bohol and the Silliman University Medical Center Foundation Inc. in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.In the National Capital Region (NCR), at least 9,000 received the Sinovac vaccine from March 1 to 3, 2021, data from the National VOC showed.A total of 1,184 people were vaccinated at the Philippine General Hospital, 221 at the Dr. Jose N.

LimAsean Centre for Biodiversity Executive Director*THE unprecedented rate by which we are losing our wildlife had hit much closer to home when the Covid-19 pandemic and its global consequences affected our ways of living and brought suffering to many places in the world. While the roll-out of vaccines boosts confidence, this does not fully protect and immunize us from new and emerging diseases that result from the many human-driven activities in our midst.In celebrating World Wildlife Day, the Asean Centre for Biodiversity (ACB) likewise takes the opportunity to direct attention to the role of wildlife habitats, most especially forests. The theme of this year's celebration ""Forests and Livelihoods: Sustaining People and Planet"" is a timely reminder of the life support that forest ecosystems provide.The high species diversity and endemicity in Asean forests makes the region one of the world's critical habitats. However, according to the Global Forest Resources Assessment of the Food and Agriculture Organization, from 2.18 million square kilometers in 2000, the total forest areas in the 10 Asean Member States contracted to 2.07 million square kilometers in 2020. Inevitably, this decline has been causing fragmentation and habitat loss for important animals and plants, not to mention the displacement of indigenous peoples and the reduction of natural buffers for calamities.This ongoing health crisis has brought about deeper reflection and discussion on the repercussions of our relationship with wildlife and the many pathways to safeguard nature.In a recent webinar on preventing pandemics hosted by World Wildlife Fund, Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, and Cornell Atkinson Centre for Sustainability, and moderated by Thomas Friedman of The New York Times, the ACB emphasized that apart from enforcing laws against wildlife crimes at the national and regional levels, it is crucial to stop emerging diseases at the source, meaning actions should begin before animals are taken out of their natural habitats. Increasing the coverage and improving the management of protected areas will reduce threats on ecosystems and lessen opportunities for viruses originating from wildlife to spill over to domestic animals and humans.Indeed, protecting our wildlife species contributes to increasing our resiliency. They not only contain and regulate diseases, but they also contribute to the ecological balance and expansion of forests. Wildlife supplies raw materials to sustain the livelihoods of communities living in and around their habitats, and provides basic necessities, such as food and natural cure for various ailments. As we face one crisis after another, we need to take into account the importance of the diversity of flora and fauna in our response and recovery efforts.The Asean Comprehensive Recovery Framework, which was adopted by the Asean leaders in November 2020, calls for a whole-of-community participation and collaboration among sectors. The ACB is optimistic that an integrated approach in protecting and conserving wildlife, along with effective immunization programmes, are concrete steps towards Asean's recovery, as well as in building resilience against future pandemics.In this year's celebrations of World Wildlife Day, we are encouraged to value the interconnectedness of wildlife and people, and appreciate the significant contribution of healthy forests to livelihood and public health. In the long run, protecting wildlife and their habitats somehow also acts as a vaccine that can help build our capacity to withstand socio-economic challenges and ensure a sustainable future.Happy World Wildlife Day!***Dr. Theresa Mundita S.

Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH), was the first to receive a dose of CoronaVac at around 9:30 a.m. Monday.Others who received the first of two doses of the Sinovac vaccine at the PGH were Dr. Edsel Salvana, director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the UP-National Institutes of Health; Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo; and Metro Manila Development Authority chairman Benhur Abalos Jr.Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., vaccine czar and chief implementer of the National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19, underwent medical assessment prior to vaccination. He was later inoculated after the healthcare workers at the PGH.Health workers first
The National Government targets to administer the first dose of the Sinovac vaccine to all healthcare workers nationwide, who are willing to receive the vaccine, before the end of March, said Galvez.Aside from VSMMC, the vaccines will also be delivered to the Southern Philippines Medical Center in Davao City on March 5 and 6.UP-PGH, a state-owned tertiary hospital, received 1,200 vials of the Sinovac vaccine, each containing a dose. Between 60 and 80 personnel had signed up for vaccination.At the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium, where 600 vials were delivered, testing czar Vince Dizon and medical center chief Alfonso Famaran Jr. kicked off the vaccinations.A total of 178 personnel had agreed to be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine.At the V. Luna Medical Center in Quezon City, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) held ceremonial inoculation for Dr. Fatima Claire Navarro, commanding officer of V. Luna Hospital, and two other doctors, Lt. Col. Cynthia Liao and Major Joel Lorenzo Rollo.In a statement, the AFP said it will also hold a ceremonial vaccination in primary healthcare facilities catering to Covid-19 patients in its major branches of service in the National Capital Region on March 2.At the Philippine Army General Hospital in Fort Bonifacio, its commanding officer, Dr. Joel Anastacio, led the ceremonial vaccination together with his team of medical frontliners.The Philippines received a donation of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine, the first batch of Covid-19 vaccines to reach the country, on Sunday, Feb. 28.The Sinovac vaccine is given in two doses four weeks apart to clinically healthy individuals who are 18 to 59 years old.In granting an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the Sinovac vaccine, the FDA said it is not recommended for healthcare workers who deal directly with Covid-19 patients because of clinical trial results in Brazil that showed an efficacy of only 50.38 percent for this group.Efficacy
The vaccine, however, has been found to be 100 percent efficacious against severe Covid-19 and hospitalization, and 78 percent effective in preventing mild symptoms among individuals who are 18 to 59 years old.Despite the FDA recommendation, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Council (Nitag) had retained the prioritization framework and gave healthcare workers the right of first refusal to receive the vaccine.Nitag members stressed that vaccination is purely voluntary.Chan’s plan
The mayor of Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu, Junard “Ahong” Chan, said his office intends to buy CoronaVac, saying he wants a similar vaccine distributed by the National Government.He said he will allow himself to be inoculated in public with health officials to allay fears that vaccines are harmful.Chan said the city’s 1,400 health workers will be prioritized in the vaccination.Bright business outlook
Cebu’s business leaders said the arrival of the first doses of Covid-19 vaccines heralds economic recovery.Felix Taguiam, president of the Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the “arrival of the Sinovac vaccines brings relief, at least.”“I’m sure more will come in the following days. Any brand is better than no vaccine. Let’s get everyone to understand that being vaccinated is the only way we can all move forward,” he said.Steven Yu, president of the Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the business sector’s confidence was “greatly increased and boosted” as the government showed it can “deliver the vaccines.”The start of the vaccination, said Yu, also signals that the mobility and other restrictions might be removed soon once the country gets at least two million people vaccinated, as mentioned by President Rodrigo Duterte.“Lifting the restrictions can significantly increase economic activities and shorten economic recovery timeline. Livelihood for many people will be restored, and poverty levels will be greatly reduced,” he said.Boosting consumer confidence is the future effect of the vaccines’ arrival and rollout in the country, said Rey Calooy, chairman of the Filipino Cebuano Business Club.Calooy, however, tempers his outlook, saying: “We can only see the effects when we have fully vaccinated at least more than 50 percent of the intended number of population that we can vaccinate to get the economy running.” (MVI, KFD, JOB, GCM / SunStar Philippines)",sunstar

Individuals who are keen on spreading disinformation seem to have been working double-time to get their message across. As a result, legitimate and science-based sources are being drowned out by the spread of disinformation.Aside from those who are anti-vaccines (Anti-vaxxers), the aftermath of the Dengvaxia scare has also resulted in reservations among many Filipinos.The government has been constantly posting on social media education and information materials on vaccines. Most of the materials are detailed, some in Filipino and others are presented as infographics.Government and health officials are also regularly seen in large media outfits to talk about the vaccines. Their messages are written or broadcasted by news outfits of different mediums.However, are the government and health officials doing enough to put a stop to the spread of disinformation when it comes to Covid-19? A quick look on social media shows that there are still individuals who still do not understand the concept of vaccines. These individuals are easily swayed by those spreading disinformation.Also, the masses, in general, are not able to immediately access legitimate and scientific-based information. Coupled with that are the scientific jargons that are not easy for many to fully understand.Hence, it is important for the government and health officials to go down to the grassroots to explain the vaccines and the vaccination program. The government has done several communication campaigns on polio, dengue, and measles that were cascaded to the barangay level and proved to be effective. Therefore, they can do it when it comes to communicating Covid-19 and vaccine.What could also be done is localizing communication strategies to better communicate the vaccine to the people. This means maximizing the unit handling communications in the Department of Health or that of the local government unit.To be able to vaccinate more people, not only does the government need to procure the vaccines, but there is also a need for the government to persuade people to get the vaccine. But the rampant spread of disinformation is a big challenge to get people vaccinated. Hence, it is now key for the government and health officials to properly and effectively communicate matters about the vaccine.",sunstar

Antojado,2021-03-07 00:00:00,"CEBU, Philippines —  The Department of Education (Dep-Ed) Cebu Province is encouraging its teachers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 once the vaccine is available to them, especially with DepEd preparing for the possibility of limited face-to-face classes in the coming months.While medical experts have pushed for every Filipino to get vaccinated, Dr. Marilyn Andales, DepEd Cebu Province School Division Superintendent, said the best that DepEd can do is encourage teachers as respect to their individual rights.""Dili man sila pugson... encouraged lang kay naa man pod nay right,"" Andales said.She said teachers in the province have mixed reactions about the vaccine and there are those who are hesitant to get vaccinated.""Naa pud, natural feelings labi na naa kay existing nga mga sakit… kuan sila, apprehensive what might be the effect kung naa, unya naa ko ani nga sakit… Pero naa po’y isog naa pod uban ganahan,"" Andales told reporters at the sidelines of the Enhanced Countryside Development (ECD) program launched by the Cebu Provincial Government in Pinamunganan town, on March 5.With the national government looking at easing more restrictions as the vaccination program rolls out, Andales said they have identified 12 public schools in different local government units where limited face-to-face classes may be piloted.The list, though, is still being finalized, as there are schools that have backed out after their LGU recorded cases recently.""Sa ilang place sauna, wala to sila, COVID-free, but because nisulat sila nga increasing ilahang COVID cases, so ni-decline sila to be a pilot school sa limited face to face,"" Andales said.She said DepEd is drafting the guidelines in the implementation of the face-to-face classes so that transition will be easier once President Rodrigo Duterte gives the go signal.More AstraZenecaMeanwhile, more doses of the COVID-19 shot developed by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca with the University of Oxford, will arrive in the Philippines tonight, said vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said.Galvez said 38,400 doses of the jab would arrive at around 7 p.m. on board a commercial plane.These doses form part of the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility’s pledge to initially deliver 525,600 doses to the Philippines as part of its commitment to give the country a total of 4.5 million doses of the shot by May.Malacañang announced initially that all 525,600 doses would arrive on March 1, only for this to be delayed to March 4 due to supply and logistical problems, which resulted in only 487,200 doses landing in the country.Speaking to health workers at the Ospital ng Parañaque, Galvez said all 525,600 doses did not arrive at the same time because a commercial plane was used for its delivery.The Philippines expects to receive up to 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine this year through the COVAX facility, which ensures that developing countries get access to the coveted drug.The doses from the COVAX facility is on top of the 17 million procured by the national government, local governments and the private sector, which are expected to arrive later this year.AstraZeneca’s shot, which has secured emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration, is found to be 70 percent effective on average and only need to be stored at standard fridge temperatures of 2°C.A member of the private research firm OCTA warned, however, that the shot’s efficacy could decrease to just 10 percent against the new coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa — 58 cases of which have already been detected in the Philippines.The health department sought to soothe those fears, saying that the studies cited only used a small sample of individuals, although it did say that the variant from South Africa, known as B.1.351, “may have an impact on vaccine efficacy.”The World Health Organization (WHO) stands by the use of AstraZeneca vaccine after a preliminary study suggested the jab offered less protection against B.1.351.ModernaAside from the AstraZeneca vaccine, about 20 million doses from US biotechnology company Moderna are expected by the end of May or early June, Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez said Saturday.The Moderna vaccine has, so far, shown a 94 percent efficacy, higher than either that of Sinovac or AstraZeneca which arrived in the past week.At a Laging Handa briefing, Romualdez said the Philippines is also likely to get 117,000 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine from the COVAX Facility, initiated by WHO.American company Johnson and Johnson has also allocated six million of its COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines, he added.Overall, the Philippines is expected to receive over 40 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the US and the United Kingdom this year, Romualdez and British Ambassador Daniel Pruce said in separate interviews.- Philstar.com, JMO (FREEMAN)",Philstar

But it potentially also is a moment where we lose concentration,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference.“I really am very concerned that... we think we’re through this. We’re not.“And countries are going to lurch back into third and fourth surges if we’re not careful.“We should not waste the hope that vaccines bring... by dropping our guard in other areas.”WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the first full week of the COVAX roll-out, but said wealthy countries were nonetheless still leaving others behind in the vaccination rush.Within Africa, Angola, the DR Congo, The Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan and Uganda have now received their first doses through COVAX.Elsewhere, Cambodia, Colombia, India, Moldova, the Philippines and South Korea have also taken deliveries.“In the next week, COVAX will deliver 14.4 million doses to a further 31 countries. That brings the total number of countries to 51,” said Tedros.“This is encouraging progress, but the volume of doses being distributed through COVAX is still relatively small.”He said the first round of allocations, running until the end of May, only covered between two and three percent of the population in recipient states, “even as other countries make rapid progress towards vaccinating their entire population within the next few months.”He called for vaccine production to be urgently ramped up, including through linking manufacturers with rival companies that have spare capacity.Tedros also said the planet would be feeling the mental scars from the pandemic for years to come and said the scale of its impact would be worse than during the recovery from World War II.“The whole world is affected. Each and every individual. That means mass trauma which is beyond proportion. Even bigger than what the world experienced after the Second World War,” he said.“And when there is mass trauma it affects communities for many years to come. Countries have to see it as such and prepare for that. Mass, mass trauma.”Brazil fearsMeanwhile Tedros voiced alarm about the coronavirus situation in Brazil, where cases and deaths have shot up, bucking the global trend.He said that in the week beginning Nov. 2, there were 114,000 new cases in Brazil – a figure that hit 374,000 in the week of Feb. 22.Tedros said the number of deaths had also shot up from 2,500 to 8,000 over the same time period.“The situation is very serious and we’re very concerned, and the public health measures that Brazil takes should be aggressive while also rolling out vaccines,” he said. “Brazil has to take this very, very seriously.”He said that because Brazil bordered so many other countries, the situation there threatened the entire South American continent.Ryan said the P1 variant – which has now been found in 29 countries – had become dominant in Brazil, adding to its woes.He said basic public health measures were still the “best bet” in trying to control case numbers.“Our risk, to an extent, is still in our hands,” Ryan said.But he added that it was very hard in countries like Brazil with large urban populations to take measures like physical distancing and mask-wearing “where they don’t have the resources to do that without the support of the state.”",Philstar

""We remain committed to making our vaccine available on every continent to help end this global pandemic.”Taken in two doses, Moderna has reported a 94% efficacy rate for its candidate vaccine. It was approved for emergency use by US regulators in late 2020 and was the jab that America's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci received in December of last year.Apart from the agreed 13 million doses, officials said a separate deal for another 7 million is also anticipated, bringing the total allocation to 20 million as said by Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez Saturday.The development marks a crucial step in the country's vaccination efforts and in turn, on government's bid to inoculate 50 to 70 million this year alone.A supply deal, however, is still different from a purchase agreement. Last month, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said government has signed supply deals with five manufacturers that he did not name.But nothing on procurement has been made final to date, and the jabs that the Philippines have received so far are donations such as Beijing's Sinovac and the Astrazeneca doses from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility.",Philstar

However, it decided to let go of Pfizer-BioNtech, the first vaccine to be given an EUA in the country, mainly due to storage concernsLabella said he will have himself vaccinated, as long as it is safe for senior citizens, as soon as the vaccine arrives.“Ako, magpabakuna gyud ko because this is the one of the ways that we can go back to normal,” Labella said.He said the city can also hold its own simulation of the vaccination program just like what Lapu-Lapu did.Based on the March 4, 2021 data from the Department of Health (DOH)-7, Cebu City has 3,316 active cases with 143 more logged that day. — JMO (FREEMAN)",Philstar

We are going in circles. This is the only thing that will stop the cycle of COVID.”When they first made a survey on who were willing to get inoculated with CoronaVac, QCGH director Josephine Sabando said only three out of over 1,000 personnel answered in the affirmative.Most of the hospital employees were willing to wait for other vaccine brands, Sabando said.Mayor Joy Belmonte admitted that she was initially dismayed when she heard that only a handful were willing to receive the vaccine developed by Sinovac, which was granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.Belmonte lauded Sabando for convincing more medical personnel to get vaccinated with Sinovac.Sabando said 300 doses of Sinovac received by Quezon City have been allocated, with more on the waitlist.The hospital director said she organized town hall meetings where she presented data about the efficacy of Coronavac, especially for severe COVID cases.“It prevents mild cases of COVID-19 by 50.4 percent. For moderate, it is 78 percent. But for severe, it is 100 percent similar to AstraZeneca,” Sabando said.“With this vaccine, we are preventing moderate to severe cases among our healthcare workers. Once vaccinated, there will be almost complete protection from hospitalization, intubation, even death,” she added.Sabando underscored the importance of vaccinating health workers as soon as possible, citing the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila.Belmonte expressed gratitude to the frontline workers who consented to receive the China-made vaccine.“This is a milestone in our COVID-19 response. We have begun the vaccination starting with our health workers,” she said.“I want our doctors and healthcare workers to be protected in any way possible.

It is miles away from the vaccination progress in its ASEAN neighbors like Indonesia which has so far rolled out 2.69 million doses, Myanmar with 104,664 doses and Cambodia 33,211 doses.Generally, developing Asia is much behind in vaccination compared to the US and Europe. ADB principal health specialist Eduardo Banzon said a lot of factors can explain the slow progress.“There’s problem on cold chain logistics for the vaccines and this is adult vaccination. Most of the countries are used to childhood vaccination, it’s a little different now,” Banzon said.“It’s a campaign type and shifting to campaign mode for the next six months or so would be challenging. Vaccine hesitance is a problem but not a problem that cannot be solved,” he said.ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada, for his part, emphasized that vaccine rollouts – from procurement to deployment to confirmation of effectiveness – will shape every country’s reopening and recovery this year.“Vaccine roll out is very critical in deciding and reopening of each country,” Sawada said.Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Harry Roque denied insinuation by administration critics that President Duterte was setting the bar low when the latter said the country would achieve normalcy only by 2023. “Well, you know that going back to normalcy is anyone’s guess,” he said.He explained the President’s statement was logical since some experts have said that the country might attain “herd immunity” only a year after a vaccination kickoff.He said if the country completes its vaccination program this year, it will only be by 2022 that herd immunity could be established to signal a return to normalcy.Roque said the government is working doublly hard to restore the public’s faith in the vaccine and the economy.“I don’t think there is a chilling effect on consumption. Why? As the President has said a vaccination program will only have to take off and attract many people for him to decide on opening everything,” he said. – Christina Mendez",Philstar

The first thing is that he’s very happy with the rollout, with what’s happening in the rollout. He wants to see more happening as a challenge to all of us. Perhaps he wants to see a more massive rollout,” Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said.Simultaneous vaccine rollouts would be held in the Cordilleras, Ilocos, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Western Visayas and Eastern Visayas on Monday.Since Monday, Philippine Airlines has airlifted 55,200 doses of Sinovac vaccines to Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Legazpi and Cotabato on four different flights.Upon arrival, the vaccine were loaded into cold-storage vans and delivered to various hospitals in preparation for regional vaccination drives.Loosening restrictionsAnd because of the expected arrival of vaccines from both the COVAX facility and Chinese drug-maker Sinovac, Nograles added that it’s possible to place the entire country under the most lenient modified general community quarantine or MGCQ.Around 9,077 persons have received vaccines in 10 Metro Manila hospitals so far, with the government allotting 3.7 million vaccine doses solely for healthcare workers.The Armed Forces of the Philippines confirmed that 2,290 military health personnel have been inoculated in five sites during the first four days of vaccination.For the Philippine Coast Guard, commodores Fran Eden and Luz Escarilla, the first women doctors to reach the rank, expressed willingness to receive the Sinovac vaccine.Breach in protocolMeanwhile, Malacañang admitted yesterday that protocols were breached when Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority public services head Michael Salalima and Quezon Rep. Helen Tan were vaccinated despite the policy prioritizing healthcare workers.“We are not perfect in implementing protocol, we had breaches but we learned from it and now, everyone knows it’s medical frontliners first,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said.National Task Force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. said the breach in prioritization protocols merits a probe.“There are no directives like that. That’s wrong, what we have is all medical frontliners, the 1.7 million (medical) frontliners would be prioritized for now. We don’t have enough vaccines… we will investigate that just in case there was indeed an occurrence like that,” Galvez said.On the other hand, Tan denied receiving special treatment and argued she received the vaccine slot through her son, a surgeon at Veterans Memorial Medical Center.“I would like to ask the public not to perceive this as VIP treatment, since it is totally false and misguided, inasmuch as I am a legal dependent, an immediate family member of a frontliner working as a medical professional at the VMMC,” the congresswoman, a doctor by profession, lamented. — Rudy Santos, Romina Cabrera, Robertzon Ramirez, Edu Punay, Michelle Zoleta, Tina Mendez, Neil Jayson Servallos",Philstar

To which, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vegeire said: ""No matter what the publications say that its efficacy has gone lower, until we are not certain, we will continue to use the vaccines.""The arrival marks an important step in the vaccination efforts in the country, as some health workers — first in line to receive the jabs — sought alternatives to Sinovac.Government said too that medical workers above 60 could be prioritized to get Pfizer vaccines, since Sinovac is not recommended for senior citizens.All donations, none boughtCOVAX facility's allocation is different from the direct procurement by government to vaccine manufacturers.The European Union, for one, said it has provided € 2.2 billion to help countries gain access to vaccines, including the Philippines.In a statement, EU's ambassador to the country Luc Véron said the union ""has both a responsibility and interest to make vaccines available for all,"" adding that the union is the ""biggest contributor"" to the COVAX's donation to the country.To date, only term sheets have have been signed, with no purchase deals yet.

(Sinopharm) has also developed a coronavirus vaccine.Only Sinovac’s CoronaVac has been authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, while Sinopharm’s jab is still being reviewed by the drug regulator.There have been some fears, particularly from opposition lawmakers, that China is deploying vaccine diplomacy, or using its access to vaccines to force countries to bend to its will.Top government officials have downplayed these concerns, with Malacañang even saying that the donations would not affect the country’s territorial claims in the West Philippine Sea.China considers the West Philippine Sea, or the part of the South China Sea within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, as part of its territory despite a 2016 arbitral ruling that held that its territorial claims in the area have no legal basis.It also passed in January a new law that allows Chinese coast guard to fire at foreign vessels and demolish structures built on contested islands, which prompted the Department of Foreign Affairs to lodge a diplomatic protest and the Armed Forces of the Philippines to increase its naval presence in the West Philippine Sea.During the course of his administration, Duterte has made a remarkable pivot to China, warming up ties with the Asian giant.He has also made clear his preference for Chinese vaccines, especially for the still-unauthorized Sinopharm jabs.Smuggled Sinopharm vaccines were used to inoculate members of Duterte’s security group. Former special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo said he and other top government officials have had themselves inoculated with these same illegal shots. — with a report from Bella Perez-Rubio",Philstar

They were vaccinated with unauthorized and smuggled Sinopharm vaccines in late 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte himself disclosed last December.The innoculation mess drew widespread criticism and calls for accountability, but local regulators said their investigation has hit a ""blank wall"" with no cooperation from the PSG. A similar probe into the use of the same smuggled vaccines by columnist Mon Tulfo, ""Cabinet-level"" officials and a senator are similarly likely to go nowhere.Medical experts warned that failing to hold someone responsible for the unauthorized vaccinations could set a bad precedent for bringing in medicines or other vaccines into the country.They also said that justifying the apparent disregard for the law could undermine vaccination efforts in the country, at a time when public mistrust of the jabs has remained high.Health workers are at the top of government's priority list to get the jabs. But only days into vaccinations, incidents of some officials receiving the jabs despite not being on the list have drawn flak.Later on sought for comment, presidential spokesperson in a briefing admitted ""breaches"" into the vaccination program.""Courtesy of these three incidents, everyone should now know that the first vaccines are only for medical frontliners,"" he said partly in Filipino.

We are looking at how we can accelerate delivery,” he said in a television interview.The WHO official also underscored that on the global level, they are seeing two bottlenecks for the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccines.First is that pharmaceutical companies could not meet the manufacturing targets for the vaccines.“These are biological processes and they could not produce the quantities they anticipated they could early on,” Abeyasinghe said.The other bottleneck is on the delivery process.“These vaccines need to be transported. Maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world,” Abeyasinghe said.He added that 190 countries have signed up to the COVAX facility, anticipating to receive COVID-19 vaccines.The WHO official said the “consignments are ready and just logistics arrangements are being made.”“So once we have a finalization and a confirmed itinerary of the delivery, we will share that information… I don’t want to create any expectations until we have a firm date,” he added.Sinopharm EUAMeanwhile, Duterte is waiting for the approval of the emergency use application (EUA) of Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm, Malacañang said yesterday.Duterte is a senior citizen, but he is not expected to be among the first to be inoculated in the government’s vaccination program.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend administering Sinovac vaccines – the first COVID-19 shots to arrive in the country – to health workers and senior citizens despite the approval of its EUA. The China-made vaccine posted only a 50.4-percent efficacy rate among health care workers exposed to the coronavirus.Last Monday, Roque said a Palace legal team is studying whether the 75-year-old Duterte can be vaccinated with jabs manufactured by Sinopharm, which has secured a compassionate use license. The issue, however, has become moot and academic because Sinopharm has already applied for EUA, according to the Palace spokesman.“That question is already moot and academic because the President will be waiting for the EUA because I reported yesterday (March 1) that Sinopharm has applied for EUA. He will just wait for the approval of Sinopharm,” Roque said at a press briefing yesterday.In an interview, FDA director general Eric Domingo said Sinopharm submitted an application online Monday afternoon.“We are looking at the documents now to see if the documents are complete or if there are any documents that need to be submitted before we officially accept the application,” Domingo added.In December last year, the Presidential Security Group (PSG) admitted that some of its members had received COVID-19 shots ahead of the FDA’s approval of the local use of COVID-19 vaccines.PSG chief Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III defended the vaccination, saying Duterte’s security aides need to ensure that they do not pose a threat to the President’s health and safety.Last Sunday, Duterte, who has expressed readiness to be vaccinated in public, said he would heed his doctor’s advice on what COVID-19 shot to get.“We have to be careful. I have my own doctor. She thinks that another brand… I will not mention it, I will just wait for it. She is waiting for it,” the President said at a press conference at Villamor Airbase.“On the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage. It is to my self-interest that I should get one. No doubt about it. As to what brand, that’s the problem because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added.Clinical trialsHealth Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire yesterday said Janssen Pharmaceuticals is conducting clinical trials in the country for its two-dose regiment COVID-19 vaccines.Vergeire added that Janssen is looking at the possibility that the two-dose vial is more efficacious against the coronavirus or will give higher immunity.Aside from Janssen, the FDA had also allowed Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals to do clinical trials in the Philippines. – Sheila Crisostomo, Alexis Romero",Philstar

That is why yesterday’s session was monumental as we already agreed on a resolution that was authored by Garcia (and) Archival, bringing the letter of intent to Mayor Labella to the pharmaceuticals,” said Vice Mayor Michael Rama, the city’s lead convenor for vaccine rollout.The two vaccine brands which the City Council, the convenor body, and the multi-sectoral group have agreed to enter into an agreement with soon are AstraZenica and Covovax/Novavax.AstraZenica already has an Emergency Use Authorization while Covovax’s application is still under review.Sinovac, while also given nod by the Cebu City government, is no longer an option since it is already under the national government’s vaccination program.“With regard to the Sinovac vaccine, since the national government has already purchased the same, the Cebu City government will wait for the guidelines as to how it should be implemented and distributed to the constituents, mindful (of) the latter’s right to choose which vaccine to receive,” part of the resolution states.Rama reiterated that the council is also open to other vaccine brands, such as Pfizer and Moderna, as long as they have secured an EUA, do not need ultra-cold storage, and the price is reasonable.“We are not limiting it to other vaccines if they get the FDA’s EUA. But we have to consider the costs and storage. It’s going to be a nightmare if it needs ultra-storage,” the vice mayor said.The City Council is expected to finalize the number of vaccines to be purchased before entering into a purchase agreement.The city government initially set aside P400 million for the purchase of vaccines against COVID-19.Meanwhile, the council also had initial discussions on the city’s vaccine priorities as well as vaccination sites, vaccinators, and other personnel needed in its vaccination program.The proposed vaccination drive-thru had also been scrapped after Dr. Ilya Abellanosa of the Cebu City Health Department said individuals that have been vaccinated need to be monitored yet for some time before being allowed to go home.Councilor Alvin Dizon also opened up on the possibility of having a “house-to-house” vaccination for seniors and PWDs which Abellanosa said is already being considered in their initial plan. — with Decemay P.

This should not change even with COVID-19,” Lopez said.He said employees should have an option.“Anyway if an employee is not vaccinated, he or she is the one at risk of getting COVID-19,” Lopez said.The labor group said the government should immediately act to prevent the discriminatory and coercive mandatory vaccination in some workplaces.Based on internal surveys initiated by some companies, the ALU said a large number of working people are reluctant to be vaccinated for fear of adverse or side effects.In Iloilo City, the local government intends to enforce a “no vaccine, no work” policy in public and private offices operating in the city, it said.“This mandatory workplace policy is a form of coercion and discrimination, which violates the right of workers to freely decide and chose for themselves, particularly with regards to their health and well-being,” the group said.ALU vice president Gerard Seno said the group is advocating for the vaccination of all workers and pushing for the prioritization of essential workers to be inoculated with safe and effective vaccines.Seno said the decision of any person not be vaccinated should be respected and employers could only persuade employees with the benefits and advantages of being vaccinated.Sen. Joel Villanueva pressed for the immediate vaccination of workers, saying it is the only way for the economy to recover.Villanueva, chair of the Senate labor committee, said he moved for the inclusion of workers in the vaccination program’s priority lane as he knew that unless workers are given back their jobs, the economy will have a difficult time recovering.“We believe that we will be able to recover only if our workers are protected,” Villanueva said in a radio interview.He cited data showing up to 17 million workers lost their jobs at the height of the enhanced community quarantine from March to April.Millions of families suffered economically due to the pandemic, which hit the country in March 2020, he said.P100 wage hikeMeanwhile, labor group Defend Job Philippines yesterday called for an immediate action on the pending petition for a P100 across-the-board wage increase for workers nationwide.“We hope the labor department and the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) will act immediately on our petition as this is an urgent matter for Filipino workers in the wake of a pandemic,” Defend Jobs spokesman Christian Lloyd Magsoy said.NWPC executive director Criselda Sy gave assurance that the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) is acting on the petition filed by Defend Jobs Philippines.“The petition was filed before the RTWPB-NCR. The board is acting on the petition,” Sy said.Magsoy said prices of commodities and services are steadily going up at this time of pandemic, except for the wages of workers.Based on the group’s oil price monitoring, Magsoy said, the costs of gasoline and diesel increased eight times since January this year.“The series of big-time hikes on the costs of oil and petroleum products was an additional burden to the already loaded shoulders of Filipino workers in the light of the consistent price surges of basic commodities and services in this time of a pandemic,” Magsoy said in a statement.He said the government must immediately do something to stop these unlimited oil price hikes.Aside from intervening in the deregulated status of oil pricing in the country, Magsoy said the government should also prioritize and speed up the implementation of a P100 emergency wage relief.The group filed a formal wage petition before the NCR wage board on Monday.",Philstar

Carlito Galvez, said the national government will add more doses for Cebu.“Yung Region 7, padagdagan po natin kasi tumataas po kasi ang kanilang kaso po doon at tsaka may mga variants na po doon, so padagdagan po natin,” he said.Dr. Gerardo Aquino, Jr., VSMMC chief of hospital, said they wanted to have 2,900 health workers to get the vaccine but several have expressed apprehension against Sinovac.Loreche said that the doses that will not be used in Cebu will be given to other hospital health care workers in the region retained by DOH.Dr. Van Philip Baton, DOH-7 medical coordinator for infectious diseases, called on the public to give the vaccine a chance as it work and proven to be effective, safe, and has saved lives.He said vaccination is the only way for the country to achieve herd immunity once a large portion of the population is inoculated.Dr. Junjie Zuasula, head of DOH-7’s Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, echoed Baton’ statement.“Achieving herd immunity will take time. It will also depend on the supply of vaccines. But one thing is certain – we will achieve herd immunity in due time,” Zuasula said during a forum of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV).Emotional ArrivalRetired Major General Melquiades Feliciano, Visayas implementer of the Inter-Agency Task Force, had volunteered to be vaccinated on March 4.He described the arrival of the vaccine at the Mactan Cebu International Airport as being emotional.“Oo, medyo naging emotional dahil at long last, dumating. Diba, ito yung pinakahihintay natin? Masaya lang talaga, masaya, hindi lungkot,” Feliciano told The Freeman.His wife, Mia, said on Facebook: “Cried happy tears. Light at the end of the tunnel.”Feliciano said some doses will be given to workers in other government hospitals and, if there will be doses left, barangay health care workers can benefit.He is hoping that vaccines from AstraZenica will finally arrive in the Philippines.Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales of OPAV said Cabinet members and key IATF officials, including Galvez, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque will be in Cebu tomorrow, March 4.Business SectorBusinessman Kenneth Cobonpue, chairperson of the Regional Development Council in Central Visayas, said the business sector is very eager for the vaccination.Cobonpue said getting people vaccinated is one of the best ways to revive the economy further, especially in Central Visayas where travel and tourism play a huge role in people’s income.But while the vaccines give a glimmer of hope, Loreche reminded the public to still observe minimum health protocols against COVID-19.China DonationSinovac’s CoronaVac is the third COVID-19 vaccine brand, aside from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA).At least 600,000 doses of the Coronavac arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, February 28. The vaccines arrived at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board a Chinese military plane.President Rodrigo Duterte viewed the crate containing the vaccine doses and inspected the actual vaccine vials before the vaccines were transported in at least six 40-footer trucks to cold chain storage facilities that include the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and the Metropac Logistics in Marikina City.In an earlier report, Sinovac is among three vaccines being considered by Cebu City for its own vaccination program alongside Novavax/Covovax and AstraZenica.Novavax has a pending EUA application.The city is no longer considering Pfizer-BioNtech, the first vaccine to be given an EUA in the country, mainly due to storage concerns. — Caecent No ot-Magsumbol, JMO (FREEMAN)",Philstar

So whatever the vaccine (brand is), what’s important is we have the freedom to choose which vaccines we want,” she said, stressing that protection against the disease is better than none.Mayor Vico Sotto said Sabarre’s willingness to receive vaccines would help drum up confidence in vaccines.“When we see she’s safe (after receiving the vaccines) and strong as always, the confidence level is expected to rise,” Sotto said.Pasig began vaccinating health workers yesterday with only half of the 300 initially scheduled vaccine recipients opting to get injected. Health workers from Pasig City General Hospital and the Children’s Hospital were reportedly afraid of receiving vaccines.While Sotto said the city would respect their decision to opt out of receiving the Sinovac vaccines, he reiterated his call to trust experts.“When the Department of Health, doctors, Food and Drug Administration and regulatory counterparts in other countries, and experts say a particular vaccine brand is safe and effective, we can be sure that these are indeed safe and effective,” he said.The resistance was also understandable, he added, since more data and trial results have yet to come in.

The local company also needs to present proof it is the distributor of Sinopharm in the country. Related StoriesFDA says China's Sinopharm applied for emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine“Once they submit the documents, we will begin the evaluation,” Domingo said in a public briefing Wednesday. “Until we see scientific evidence, we see the population involved in their Phase 3 clinical trials, their experience in using the vaccine in other countries, that’s the only time we can give recommendation on the use of the vaccine,” he added.The drug regulator confirmed Tuesday the receipt of an online application seeking emergency use authorization for the jab developed by China’s state-owned pharmaceutical company.Domingo earlier said it may take “around four to six weeks” before the agency can decide on the application because Sinopharm has yet to receive EUA from a stringent regulatory authority or from the World Health Organization. The lack of relevant documents may delay it further.“We’re very objective in approving vaccines. We have a checklist of what we’re looking for: safety, efficacy and quality,” he said.Interim analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials showed that Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine was 79.3% effective in preventing the disease, lower than the reported efficacy rates of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna of 95% and 94.1%, respectively. The data, however, have not been peer-reviewed.So far, only the vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac Biotech have obtained EUAs from the FDA. The application of Russia’s Gamaleya for its COVID-19 vaccine remains pending.The jab developed by Sinopharm is the one preferred by President Rodrigo Duterte.It was the same vaccine used by members of the Presidential Security Group, special envoy to China Mon Tulfo, some “Cabinet-level” officials and a senator in an unauthorized vaccine activity last year.The country began its delayed COVID-19 vaccination campaign Monday, with health workers, government officials and uniformed personnel the first in the line to receive donated Sinovac shots.",Philstar
https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/03/02/2081288/2-vmmc-personnel-have-allergic-reaction-vaccine,2 VMMC personnel have allergic reaction to vaccine,Michael Punongbayan,2021-03-02 00:00:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Two personnel of the Veterans Memorial Medical Center showed mild allergic reactions after receiving the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine, VMMC director Dr. Dominador Chiong confirmed yesterday.He clarified though that “both vaccine recipients are now fine” and that the reactions, in the form of rashes, were immediately addressed after proper medication.Chiong said reports that three others suffered dizziness after being vaccinated are untrue, noting that the three had high blood pressure and were hypertensive.“They were not yet inoculated when they had dizziness,” he explained, adding that the three just probably got nervous.At the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP), nurse Mary Ann Bausa said she preferred not to wait anymore for the arrival of any other vaccine since Sinovac’s CoronaVac vaccines are already available.“Any vaccine will do. Anyway, we were told that its effectivity rate is also high… although if given to health workers (it is low),” she pointed out.As for her fellow health workers who are still hesitant to be vaccinated, Bausa said “it’s their own decision what vaccines they want to get.”The LCP received yesterday an initial 600 doses of Sinovac vaccines, which are good for 300 health care workers who should receive two doses to maximize effectivity.Based on the emergency use authorization issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Sinovac vaccine, its efficacy rate if given to health workers is 50.4 percent as they are more exposed to COVID-19.But if used for the general population, its efficacy rate to prevent moderate symptoms stands at 78 percent and at 100 percent to prevent severe complications.As of yesterday, 150 workers are in the master list of recipients of LCP but hospital executive director Vincent Balanag Jr. is expecting more workers to avail themselves of the vaccines in the coming days.FDA director general Eric Domingo yesterday described as “painless” the Sinovac jab he received at the Philippine General Hospital, where he is an attending ophthalmologist.“The nurse at PGH was good. I did not feel it when I was being vaccinated,” he said in an interview, adding that a few hours after receiving the vaccine, he still could not feel anything even on the injection site.“Of course I have to monitor myself in the next 24 hours… But (so far), I do not feel soreness and systemic symptoms like fever,” Domingo said.At 52 years and being a health care worker, he noted that he fits the criteria for Sinovac vaccinees.Meanwhile, members of the Alliance of Health Workers at LCP staged a “lunch break” to denounce what they called government’s “consistent inconsistencies” in the vaccination program against COVID-19.The group’s president, Robert Mendoza, said they are “dismayed at the sudden turnaround decision of the government to inoculate health care workers (HCWs) with Sinovac”?as this is “sacrificing the health and safety of the health workers.”He added that the government is “practically forcing HCWs to accept Sinovac vaccines, called CoronaVac.”Eleazar Sobinsky, LCP Employees Association president, said HCWs deserve the best vaccine against the novel virus as their “health and lives are always at stake.”Sobinsky stressed that it would not be enough for the government to simply indemnify health care workers “who will suffer severe side effects or death due to the COVID-19 vaccines.”“We want the government and health authorities to be held accountable in indemnifying victims of severe effects of the vaccine,” he added.Fr. Marlito Ocon, one of the chaplains at PGH, said he preferred to wait for other anti-COVID vaccines to arrive and have options as he expressed his belief that both patients and frontliners should wait for what they deem as the “best vaccine” against the coronavirus.“I’d rather wait for the best one if there are other (brands) that are coming… It is not as if that (Sinovac) is the only vaccine that would arrive in the country or that is the only vaccine available so we have to take the risk for the sake also of the people we serve, our patients and to all frontliners who are here at the hospital,” Ocon told the Catholic church-run Radio Veritas.He revealed that during a meeting with the Department of Health (DOH) at PGH last Sunday, a survey conducted by the hospital that showed 95 percent were against being vaccinated with Sinovac was mentioned.One common reason for this is that they would no longer be able to avail themselves of other vaccines brands if they get inoculated with CoronaVac. – Sheila Crisostomo, Evelyn Macairan",Philstar

She said no doses should be wasted.Dr. Van Baton, DOH-7 regional medical coordinator for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, said that the country targets to vaccinate 70 million of the population for the first year, another 40 million for the second year, and another 12 million for the third year.This is to attain herd immunity, Zuasula said as he appealed to everyone to give the COVID-19 vaccines a chance.Loreche, for her part, said “whatever vaccine is available, we have to use it.”5.6 million CV residentsIn Central Visayas, a total of 5,634,789 people are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.Loreche did not discuss how these people were identified nor did she provide a breakdown of the number. However, she said that there will be a total of 4,973 vaccination teams that will conduct the vaccination for 14 days.Security in placeMeanwhile, the Cebu City Police Office said security measures for the transport of the vaccines are already “in place” once they arrive here on Mar. 4.""Part sa security plan nga ipatuman sa PRO-7 (Police Regional Office) is ang pag-transport sa time nga maabot siya...

https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/03/02/2081308/philippines-buy-1-million-doses-sinovac-march,Philippines to buy 1 million doses of Sinovac this March,Jose Rodel Clapano,2021-03-02 00:00:00,"MANILA, Philippines — One million more doses of COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinovac of China will arrive within the month under a P700-million purchase deal that is set to boost the country’s initial stock of 600,000 doses of the same brand donated by Beijing.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. made the announcement yesterday as the government rolled out its vaccination program following the arrival on Sunday of 600,000 donated doses of Sinovac vaccines from China.Galvez said CoronaVac of Sinovac and Russia’s Sputnik V are the only available vaccines due to heavy global demand.“That is why we have procurement this coming March. We have one million from Sinovac,” Galvez said.He said there is already a purchase order or PO for the acquisition of one million doses for P700 million.“We have funds. We have P700 million funds,” Galvez pointed out. “Once we sign it, the one million doses will arrive this coming March in tranches. We saw 500,000 doses loaded onto an airplane. So, that would be in two tranches.”Sinovac Biotech general manager Helen Yang told ANC they are still discussing details of the shipment with the Philippine government.“The vaccine showed a good safety profile and strong efficacy results to prevent the severe cases and could lower down the burdens of the health care system,” Yang said.“We sincerely hope that the Philippines will start to use the vaccine and help reboot the economy,” she added.Galvez said the country’s supply agreements with other COVID-19 vaccine brands Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and Novavax were still pending.Aside from Sinovac, other COVID-19 vaccine brands issued emergency use authorization by the Philippine FDA were Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.Galvez also said there is no definite date yet for arrival of 3.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines due to global shortage of vaccines.Based on previous announcement, AstraZeneca vaccines were supposed to arrive yesterday, under the COVAX Facility.“There is no definite date yet. We have seen the reality on the ground. The global shortage of supply is acute,” Galvez said.Galvez also said the first batch of the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech would likely be delivered by the second quarter. The delivery was initially announced to happen in mid-February.After seeing surveys showing low public confidence in the Sinovac vaccine, the President – Galvez said – ordered him and other top officials to be inoculated with it.At the Philippine General Hospital where he got inoculated with CoronaVac, Galvez said Filipinos would not be able to return to normal life and the economy would remain sluggish if they refuse to get immunized immediately and opt to wait for Western vaccines, which would come later in the year.“We should not wait for the so-called best vaccine. There is no best vaccine because the best vaccines are those which are effective and efficient and come early,” Galvez said.Supply shortageSome 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine from the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX facility were supposed to be delivered yesterday.“We understand the challenge COVAX is facing because they are supplying the global community. What they have said is that the date of arrival is indefinite. Hopefully, by first quarter,” Galvez said, explaining the delay in the delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines.Based on FDA evaluation, AstraZeneca has an efficacy rate of 70 percent after the first dose, a rate that will increase with the second dose after four to 12 weeks.The Philippines has reported 576,352 COVID-19 cases overall, with 12,318 recorded deaths.The government aims to inoculate 70 million of its 108 million people this year to achieve herd immunity and reopen an economy that in 2020 saw its worst contraction on record, due largely to tight restrictions on movement since mid-March.Galvez insisted that the Philippines might not move forward unless everyone is immunized. “It is our moral obligation,” said Galvez.At yesterday’s vaccination kick-off, PGH director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi was the first to be inoculated in public by a nurse, followed by Cabinet and health officials.Manila Mayor Isko Moreno urged the public to trust whatever vaccine is available.“Let’s get vaccinated, let’s save lives every day. We need to move on,” Moreno said, adding he would take his turn after a week.The Department of Health (DOH) said it is looking at two weeks to finish administering the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines.“We are looking at two weeks for us to be able to roll it out properly and then we will have the next two weeks to monitor if there would still be ‘quick substitution list (QSL)’ that will be used,” DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said.Vergeire noted in a television interview that they want to check the QSL to determine if there are alternative vaccines that have not been utilized.“So basically in two to three weeks, we will be able to utilize this because we already had a plan of rolling it out. Hospitals had been advised already and they are prepared and we started the rollout,” she added.Senators expressed hopes the Duterte administration’s COVID-19 mass vaccination program would not sputter but gain ground faster than the virus could infect Filipinos, who should also be given more vaccine choices.Honoring frontlinersSen. Joel Villanueva said that while 1,000 shots were given yesterday, 100 million more Filipinos need to be inoculated.“The journey of a hundred million shots begins with a single jab. But today’s events shouldn’t be seen as a mere symbolic start but as the start of something sustained, without letup and in numbers increasing by the week,” Villanueva said in a statement.“For that is how we can meaningfully mark the first year of the lockdown on March 15, by demonstrating our will to end COVID’s reign of terror, one injection at a time,” he said.He said a vaccination program done in earnest would also honor health frontliners who, along with the rest of the population, should be provided with more vaccine choices.Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said the government should match frontliners’ heroism with vaccine offensive or “the first shot in our nation’s counterattack against the virus.”That the first inoculation was given to PGH’s Legaspi “only underscores the moral responsibility of this government to support the continuing heroism of our frontliners with a vaccine offensive.”He called Legaspi the “ground commander of the biggest COVID-19 hospital.”It is also government’s duty to broaden the vaccine source or acquire “the best vaccines, the best human minds had developed,” he said.“The vaccines have arrived as we are letting our people go out of their towns freely. Our vaccine arsenal should then grow as fast as we are allowing people to move around unrestricted. Without vaccines, the virus will be faster and smarter than us,” Recto said.He said the newly signed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act brings big business to the vaccination drive – not to profit, but to use their massive wealth in vaccinating as many people as fast as possible.“With many sectors now enlisted in vaccine procurement and administration, the national government should lead from the front and not from the rear,” he said.Sen. Grace Poe said the euphoria over the first shipment of the vaccines should be matched with a clear sight on a systematic rollout of the inoculation process.“In making available the vaccine to health workers and other priority sectors, let us not forget our PUV drivers and other workers in the transportation sector who are key to our economic comeback,” Poe said.“Drivers along with the other groups in the priority list – senior citizens, teachers, OFWs, essential staff, frontline workers, indigent population – need the protection against the virus most because of their situation as we embark on the road to the new normal,” Poe said.Sen. Imee Marcos said the government must address immediately the high rate of hesitancy among Filipinos to get themselves vaccinated.“First order of business is to convince Filipinos to get vaccinated. Let’s make the best use of this endless vaccine delay and persuade our people, for their health and the safety of their family and friends, that they should get inoculated as quickly as possible with any FDA-approved vaccine,” Marcos said.“There is so much anxiety about side effects which are apparently rare and minimal – when the danger of infection is real and could be fatal. Any vaccination effort will fail with 46 percent to 47 percent of Filipinos skeptical or even against any COVID vaccines,” she said.“Vaccine hesitancy can complicate the storage and delivery of vaccines, resulting in higher costs or outright wastage,” Marcos explained.“A systematic registration process nationwide for willing vaccine recipients should already be in place if the bulk of vaccines does arrive in the third and fourth quarter of this year. This will guide the logistical requirements for transport, delivery and storage in every LGU from Luzon to Mindanao,” Marcos said.She said “the public is also at a loss on what benefits they are entitled to in case of injury or death. To elicit a more positive response to vaccination, the government must clarify its indemnification policy and how the P500-million budget for this will be spent.” – Sheila Crisostomo, Cecille Suerte Felipe",Philstar
https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/03/02/2081303/officials-frontliners-first-get-covid-19-jabs,"Officials, frontliners first to get COVID-19 jabs",Sheila Crisostomo,2021-03-02 00:00:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Almost a year after the entire Luzon was placed under enhanced community quarantine, the government rolled out yesterday its vaccination program against COVID-19 with several ranking officials getting the first jabs.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, who urged the public not to wait for the “best” vaccine and to avail themselves of the jabs, showed “leadership by example” when he received CoronaVac vaccine, developed by China’s Sinovac, at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) to boost people’s confidence in the government’s campaign.He admitted getting emotional when he saw the first batch of shipment of CoronaVac, saying “at last, the doses of hope that we have been waiting for have already arrived.” “We, Secretary Duque have been very emotional because the pressure is on us and it unburdened a lot of our sacrifices. We are really very happy because at least we already have the vaccines for our health workers,” said Galvez, who delayed his vaccination until the end of the program to ensure that health workers would go first.He encouraged the public to trust Sinovac, pointing out that Filipinos could not return to normal life and the economy would not be able to recover if people refuse to get immunized and prefer Western vaccines, which would come later this year.“We should not wait for the so-called best vaccine. There is no best vaccine because the best vaccines are those which are effective and efficient and come early,” Galvez stressed.Also among those inoculated yesterday were National Task Force against COVID-19 deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium (formerly Tala Hospital) in Caloocan City and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Benhur Abalos at the PGH.Although Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana wanted to be among the first to receive the Sinovac vaccine to build trust and confidence among personnel in the Department of National Defense, he gave in to the advice of doctors who said those above 59 years old should not be inoculated.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, 64, was also not given a jab, but he administered the vaccine to some doctors during a symbolic vaccination at the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) in Quezon City.The Department of Health said the secretary “will be vaccinated when the appropriate vaccine becomes available.”In a speech, Duque urged health care workers to allow themselves to be immunized against COVID-19, giving assurance that all vaccines evaluated by the Vaccine Expert Panel and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are safe and effective.“Millions of people have already received donated Sinovac vaccines, not only in China but in 53 other countries. And based on latest data, the ‘adverse event following immunization (AEFI)’ rate is two to five per million doses. It means that’s the only risk for AEFI,” he said.The “benefit versus risk ratio” of getting a jab against COVID-19 shows benefits far outweigh the risks, he added.The Philippines received last Sunday 600,000 doses of vaccines manufactured by the Chinese drug-maker Sinovac, the first COVID-19 jabs to be delivered in the country.A recent survey by OCTA Research indicated that only 19 percent of adult Filipinos are willing to be inoculated against COVID-19 while 46 percent prefer to pass due to safety concerns.Speaking at the ceremonial vaccination of health care workers at PGH, Galvez said getting a COVID-19 shot is a “moral obligation.”“There is no such thing as best vaccine because the best vaccine is the one that is effective and efficient and that which arrive earlier. This is a moral obligation of everyone. All of us should get ourselves vaccinated and let us not wait for what they call the best vaccine,” he said, noting that some vaccines with high efficacy rates would not be available until the third or fourth quarter.The efficacy rate of Sinovac-developed vaccines only stood at 50.4 percent among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19 but officials have maintained it is still effective against the virus. They have also noted that the World Health Organization has set a 50 percent threshold for vaccine efficacy.First in lineThe 59-year-old Dr. Eileen Aniceto – the most senior physician among 19 other pulmonologists at the LCP – was the first to receive a shot of CoronaVac that Duque personally administered.All 20 health workers who have been handling COVID-19 patients at the LCP received their COVID-19 jabs yesterday.“This vaccine, in case you do get COVID-19, will give you a better chance of surviving this infection,” Aniceto told reporters after receiving her jab.Delays on the delivery of vaccines muffled rising public anticipation but the arrival of Sinovac doses wasn’t particularly a cause for excitement either, especially for health care workers on top of the priority list of vaccine recipients.Several health professionals have begged off from receiving CoronaVac in several hospitals in Metro Manila. At the LCP, about 90 percent of all its medical staff have agreed to receive vaccines if these were Pfizer’s.“When we started our preparations for the vaccination, 90 percent agreed when it was Pfizer,” said Dr. Vincent Balanag Jr., LCP’s executive director.Dr. Chette Moje, LCP’s vaccination task force chief, said that as of yesterday only 140 hospital staff members gave their consent to receive CoronaVac. The LCP received 600 doses.Balanag said there are about 1,400 health care workers in LCP.“When we learned it’s Sinovac, of course, we all know the discussions on this one, that’s why we had a town hall meeting the day after we learned it’s Sinovac and we were told that Sinovac has its advantages,” he said.For Dr. Edward Cervales, a fellow at the Department of Pulmonology, it was a personal decision not to wait for Pfizer vaccines that he and thousands of other colleagues in the region were supposed to receive last month.“If ever we wouldn’t get vaccinated with the vaccine we have now, we wouldn’t promote more public trust in the vaccination program and I think it’s about time we move forward,” he said before receiving the jab.“It’s my personal decision to at least set an example also. Because we’ve been treating COVID-19 for almost a year and I think this is somewhat the cure eventually so physicians have to start somewhere, somehow,” he added.Health care workers from COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila were supposed to have received Pfizer vaccines about two weeks ago when the government said the rollout of the first batch of vaccines from the Covax Alliance would arrive, only to be snagged by the lack of an indemnity deal.But Dr. Alfonso Victorino Famaran Jr., medical director of the DJNRMHS or Tala Hospital in Caloocan City, believed that the vaccine he received yesterday would give him the “soonest protection” against the virus even though he would have preferred another brand.“My reason why I chose to inoculate myself with Sinovac is because I will grab the first opportunity to have myself protected against COVID-19,” he said.At the Philippine National Police, PNP General Hospital chief Lt. Col. Cleto Manongas was the first police officer to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, followed by Health Service director Brig. Gen. Luisito Magnaye and PNPGH deputy chief Lt. Col. Raymond Ona.At least 200 PNP personnel from the Health Service were vaccinated yesterday while 600 more in the coming days are expected to be inoculated with Sinovac jabs.PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said no one from the police force has backed out from receiving the China-made vaccines and the police force would be prioritizing personnel assisting in the distribution of vaccines, members of the medical reserve force and others directly dealing with COVID-19 patients.“We are very vulnerable because we are one of the agencies spearheading the security and assisting (in the vaccination program),” he said yesterday, adding that the PNP wants to assist the government in achieving herd immunity.Speaker Lord Allan Velasco will lead the House of Representatives officials to be inoculated when the vaccine allocation for the chamber arrives.“Our election leaders should be at the forefront to be able to show the people that we really need the vaccine and that this is really necessary for us to be able to control and contain the pandemic,” he said. – Michael Punongbayan, Alexis Romero, Jose Rodel Clapano, Ghio Ong, Neil Jayson Servallos, Delon PorcallaRelated video:",Philstar

I’m not sure if they filed online,” FDA chief Eric Domingo said in a text message.So far, the FDA had granted EUA to Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac.Still under evaluation are the applications of Gamaleya-Sputnik of Russia and Bharat Biotech Covaxin.Speaking to reporters at the Villamor Air Base last Sunday, Duterte said he would follow his doctor’s advice on which COVID-19 vaccine to take.“We (people who are in their 70s) have to be careful. I have my own doctor. She thinks that another brand, I will not mention it, I will just wait for it. She is waiting for it,” the President said at his first press conference since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.“In the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage. It is to my self-interest that I should get one. No doubt about it. As to what brand, that’s the problem because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added.Asked to react to Vice President Leni Robredo’s statement that he should be the first to be inoculated to boost public confidence in the COVID-19 shots, Duterte said: “Siya man ‘yong apurado, siya ang mauna (She’s the one so eager so she should be the first). I cannot just decide. She’s young, I am not.”“Why make a drama out of who should be the first? The problem is my doctor is waiting for something,” he added.Roque said the President would inform the public if he experiences side effects after getting vaccinated.“The President has promised that once he gets inoculated, it (would) be held publicly... Of course, we will inform you about the side effects if any on the President. But since he has not yet received a vaccine, that is moot and academic,” the Palace spokesman said.“Let me clarify. What is stated in the Constitution is the President has the obligation to make public his medical condition only if he has a serious illness,” he added.Duterte said health workers who do not want Sinovac vaccines can wait for the AstraZeneca shots expected within this month.“They have a choice, it’s either... AstraZeneca or Sinovac. If they do not want Sinovac, they have to wait... I was assured that it would be coming within the next few days,” the President said.Duterte stressed there would be no forced vaccination.“Now, for those who do not want to be vaccinated, that’s OK with me. I have no problem. You do not want vaccines? OK, that’s your choice,” he added.Sen. Bong Go said key government officials have asked to be vaccinated first so they could inspire confidence in the vaccines and not because they are priority.“It’s not a question anymore if the President is willing to be vaccinated in public or not because we all want to be vaccinated. We are doing this not because we are the priority. We will do this to show the public that we should trust the vaccine,” Go said.Go also expressed his willingness to be vaccinated in public together with Duterte to demonstrate the vaccines’ safety and efficacy. Go chairs the Senate committee on health and demography.Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said they haven’t received any complaint from military personnel regarding their mandatory COVID-19 vaccination.“It’s not true that many are complaining. If they don’t want Sinovac they will still be vaccinated by other brands. And if there are no free doses available, they will have to pay for them,” he told reporters in English and Filipino.AFP chief of staff Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana has yet to get inoculated. – Sheila Crisostomo, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Romina CabreraRelated video:",Philstar

The decision of any person not be vaccinated should be respected in the same way we respect those who had taken the vaccine,” said Gerard Seno, ALU national executive vice president.Seno said that employers should only try to persuade employees with the benefits and advantages of being vaccinated, but they should not coerce them to get the shot.ALU said that some factory workers have complained to them about how their superiors have told them that they would not be allowed to report to work unless they participate in the company-sponsored coronavirus vaccination drive.It added that other business owners have given instructions to supervisors and managers to deem employees who do not get vaccinated against COVID-19 as unfit to work.It also said that another group of employees have been told that they would need to present a certification to prove that they have received a COVID-19 jab before they are allowed to work.Meanwhile, Iloilo City is mulling to mandate all employees in the city to get vaccinated against COVID-19 before they are allowed to work.“Before it becomes a norm, the Department of Labor and Employment must respond quickly to these surfacing abuses and provide immediate protection measure by outlawing these unfair and unjust treatment of employees,” Seno said.While the government targets to inoculate 60 million to 70 million people in the hopes of achieving herd immunity, it is not making COVID-19 vaccines mandatory. — Xave Gregorio",Philstar

It cited results from late-stage trials in Brazil involving health workers exposed to COVID-19 that yielded only a 50.4% efficacy rate.But the health department stressed that the same Brazil study found the vaccine is 100% effective in staving off moderate to severe cases. It was also found to have efficacy rates of 65.3% and 91.25% in trials held in Indonesia and Turkey, respectively.Experts part of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group approved the Sinovac jab to be offered to those willing to take it, reiterating is safe and effective.But many health workers are reluctant and have decided to wait for other vaccines.

Please trust that this is something that will protect you because we have your best interest in mind,” noted Salvana, who is also the director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health.Salvana made the statement as the country is expecting some 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines to arrive from China today.A COVID-19 survivor, Salvana said that he is willing to take the Sinovac vaccine, as he admitted always fearing for his life.“As for me, I am excited. This is the resolution and we’ve been waiting for over a year and every day when I go out, I’m scared for my life – is this the patient that is going to infect me?” he added.Salvana said he does not want to let go of the chance to be inoculated against COVID-19.“Finally there is something that I can do, very tangible, aside from PPEs (personal protective equipment) and everything. That I know it is the start of the end of this nightmare,” he added.Salvana underscored that they respect if there are health care workers (HCWs) who would refuse Sinovac vaccines, but he reminded them that there is still “no clarity” as to when the next vaccines will come.“This is an emergency, this is a pandemic, there is a clear and present danger to HCWs,” he maintained.Last Friday, DOH-TAG and National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) had approved the use of Sinovac vaccines among HCWs directly handling COVID-19 patients.This is after the Food and Drug Administration had recommended against the inoculation of HCWs with the China-made vaccine because it will have an efficacy rate of only 50.4 in this group.But according to NITAG member Maria Corazon Quizon, the 50.4 percent effective rate is for the prevention of mild infection of COVID-19.Quizon said data show that the vaccine is 70 percent effective against moderate cases and “approaching” 100 percent effective in preventing severe cases of COVID-19“Something got lost in translation. When they said the vaccine efficacy is 50.4 percent in preventing mild infection, they did not complete the sentence that it’s 70 percent effective in preventing moderate cases and approaching 100 percent in preventing severe cases,” she added.She maintained this means that Sinovac vaccines are still able to protect the HCWs.“That is what we want at the end of the day – to prevent the moderate and severe cases,” she said.Quizon pointed out that even after the vaccination program has been rolled out in the country, it is still very important for the health protocols to be strictly observed by the public to prevent the spread of COVID-19.“Just because there are already vaccines, it’s like fiesta already. It’s not like that. We still have to practice due diligence,” she added.Salvana has cautioned against “mixing” different brands of COVID-19 vaccines, saying it could be harmful.“Mixing vaccines might even be harmful… You could have a bad allergic reaction. There’s a lot of things that can go wrong. There is no data on mixing vaccines,” he told ‘The Chiefs.’Salvana noted in some cases, when giving vaccines “too close together, the second dose might not be safe.”He added this is because the immune system of those inoculated “might be prime for other vaccines.”Salvana said those who will be given the first dose of Sinovac vaccines will receive the second dose of the same brand.He maintained they are no longer eligible to get the next vaccines that will arrive in the country, also because of the global shortage of COVID-19 jabs.",Philstar

Both companies from Korea are WHO pre-qualified vaccine manufacturers.The two Korean firms are traditional vaccine manufacturers that produce vaccines used by the United Nations Children’s Fund.Glovax is in a joint venture with Eubiologics to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine and to build the local next generation COVID vaccine plant.National Policy Against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. endorsed Glovax Biotech to the Department of Science and Technology.The local company is also in talks with the DTI’s National Development Corporation for a possible investment collaboration.The vaccine plant will cost around P7 billion to construct, including technology transfer costs. Glovax said the plant would be capable of providing 40 million doses for domestic use should the government procure them.Glovax Biotech Corp. founder and CEO Giovanni Alingog said Glovax and Eubiologics are in the process of applying for the mergency use authorization (EUA).The EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics was developed in Western New York by POP Biotechnologies Inc. and has been approved for human clinical trials.The South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety approved the combined phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials last month.Glovax said that EuCorVac-19 COVID vaccine of Eubiologics was developed in the USA but it will be mass produced at the new facility of Eubiologics in South Korea and will also be manufactured in the Philippine plant.“It is estimated that the world could vaccinate all its population in seven years and the local vaccine plant can help reduce that time frame, especially for the Philippines,” Alingog said.The company said the Glovax proposal to produce the next generation COVID vaccine offers a lot of advantages as it can capture newer COVID strains and other mutations.Other vaccines, the company said, are only 22 percent effective against the new South African strain and other new strains found around the world.The next generation COVID vaccine can be stored up to 25ºC or room temperature up to three months and 2°C to 8°C for longer period.Glovax, the first vaccine company to bring in the first vaccine in 2009/2010 during the AH1N1 swine flu pandemic, said there was also a shortage of the pandemic vaccine at that time.“With this experience, Glovax is proposing a vaccine plant to avert the current and future pandemics,” Alingog said.The vaccine-focused company has been distributing polio, tuberculosis, measles, tetanus, Pentavalent and rabies vaccines and had sold more than 5 million doses of vaccines since 2003.",Philstar

Bong Go said yesterday.To be inoculated with these vaccines are military personnel, he added.Go said there is also the expected arrival of 520,000 doses of AstraZeneca from the COVAX Facility on Monday, which will give frontliners options on which vaccines they prefer.“Finally, the vaccines will arrive from China. This is what the Chinese government promised to donate to the Philippine government. At first, it was 500,000 doses but they will add 100,000 doses for the military personnel and that’s important because that is the timetable,” said Go in an interview over radio dwIZ.The 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines are good for 300,000 recipients who shall receive two doses each.“Another good news, we are waiting for the vaccine from COVAX. It will come on Monday from AstraZeneca – about 525,600 doses. I talked to (UK) Ambassador Daniel Pruce (and he) promised to help now,” said Go.The supply forms part of the 44 million doses of COVAX to inoculate 20 percent of the population. The vaccines will arrive at 12:15 p.m. on Monday. The government is working to acquire 5.2 million to 9.2 million AstraZeneca dosages from the COVAX facility.“We thank the World Health Organization, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund towards this end,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said.“We are grateful to everyone – from our medical frontliners to our fellow Filipinos and foreign partners – who stand by us in this challenging time. Together, we will heal and recover as one nation and one people,” he said.Roque also thanked UK Ambassador Pruce for his contribution in speeding up the processes for the vaccines’ arrival in the country.“We would like to thank UK Ambassador Pruce, for it was his intercession that became the reason for the swift arrival of AstraZeneca to the Philippines,” Roque added in Filipino.Go thanked the Chinese and UK governments for the vaccines, and said their arrival took a while as the government tried to ensure the vaccines complied with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards.“They are also looking at its safety data because it is useless if it comes and is not safe. We will prioritize the safety and efficacy of those being brought to the country before we start the rollout,” he said.“Now that vaccines will arrive from China, this is Sinovac and it is important for the public to see that the vaccine rollout is starting,” Go noted.He said President Duterte ordered the rollout to start immediately so the Chief Executive could reevaluate whether to gradually open up or talk again about declaring modified general community quarantine.Duterte inoculationGo maintained that the vaccination of President Duterte will be determined by his doctors considering his health condition.“The President – his doctor will decide what vaccine to use and the doctor is already choosing what is suitable for his age and health. That is the choice. The President will definitely get vaccinated; he will show it to the public,” he noted.Go said he will have his inoculation alongside with the President – not to take advantage of his position, but to encourage the public that getting the vaccine is safe.Simulation exercisesAt a public briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire noted they have been doing everything to prepare for the vaccine rollout.“Actually, we have been prepared for weeks already because we were expecting the Pfizer vaccines before and now, we are repeating and reviewing our preparations done before,” she added.Vergeire said that part of these preparations was full-scale simulation exercises of the arrival of the vaccines at the airport and delivery to cold chain storage and other logistics last Feb. 9.There were also simulation activities at the hospitals – from how the vaccines will be taken out of their boxes up to inoculating them to recipients, among others.She noted there is now a master list of vaccine recipients and a quick substitution list (QSL) of back-up vaccinees who will step in if an original recipient backs out.The QSL is based on the priortization framework wherein health care workers will be the first ones to be vaccinated against COVID-19.Vergeire added this means that the back-up vaccines will also come from hospitals, “ideally from hospitals near the initial hospitals or the source hospitals where the vaccination is being done.”“We are ensuring that, as much as possible, not a dose of the vaccine will be wasted because we know how important each dose of these vaccines is,” she maintained.Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) says it is “all ready” for the expected arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the country today.During the Laging Handa briefing yesterday morning, MMDA chairman Benhur Abalos said they are ready for the expected arrival of the Sinovac vaccines today.“There was a simulation and the result was good. The distribution and everything that needs to be done are already ironed out,” Abalos said in Filipino.“The vaccine route is ready. We are now ready, along with the police,” he added.Abalos also said they are considering the use of EDSA bus lanes during the delivery of the vaccines from Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.The vaccines are expected to be delivered to several hospitals in different cities in Metro Manila.“We could use the bus carousel. If not, the lanes beside the bus carousel could be used,” he said.Abalos revealed that they would be enforcing the same route for the arrival of the next batches of vaccines.Highest caseAs this developed, the Department of Health’s (DOH) Case Bulletin reported 2,921 new COVID-19 infections yesterday, the highest this year.The cases were documented on Feb.24, bringing the total number of infections to 574,247.Vergeire confirmed there has been an increase in cases in the past days and this can be attributed to “various factors” such as the easing of restrictions.She said there has also been complacency on the part of the public regarding minimum health standards such as wearing of masks and face shields and maintenance of physical distancing.The official also pointed out that the other factor is the “response of the LGUs” to the pandemic.“We have to scale up our response, particularly the quarantine and isolation protocol,” she added.Vergeire maintained that many people are now doing “home quarantine and this might be a cause or a factor” for the rise in cases in the country.DOH data further showed that 42 COVID-19 patients died, raising the death toll to 12,289. On the other hand, 293 cases have recovered, bringing the total recoveries to 524,865.The number of active cases was at 37,093 or 6.5 percent of the over-all cases. – Christina Mendez, Ralph Edwin Villanueva, Sheila Crisostomo",Philstar

Junie Cua explained.Cua pointed out that centralizing procurement of vaccines through the national government is the most efficient way of acquiring the jabs. And although the measure allows procurement and purchase of vaccines to forgo public bidding during a pandemic, these are still subject to an audit.No blanket immunitySenate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said the government can’t grant absolute and blanket immunity to vaccine manufacturers because “it is against the law and contrary to public policy.”“Under the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act Congress passed last Feb. 22, COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are immune from suits for claims arising out of the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, but not for willful misconduct or gross negligence,” Drilon said.Drilon explained that any vaccinee can file claims for damages, based on the vaccine manufacturers liabilities arising from willful misconduct and gross negligence.The government recently allotted P500 million to compensate persons who may suffer adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, at a press briefing, Palace spokesman Harry Roque said President Duterte cannot compel columnist and former special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo to cooperate in the investigation about the alleged use of smuggled COVID-19 shots.“As far as Mon Tulfo is concerned, he clarified, he is no longer (a) special envoy to China. He is a private citizen so he can do as he pleases and the President is not in position to compel him to do anything, the President does not have subpoena powers,” Roque said.Roque added that it would be up to the police to look into reports about the unauthorized use of vaccines developed by Chinese firm Sinopharm. – Edu Punay, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Alexis Romero",Philstar

A friend in need is a friend indeed,” Ambassador Huang Xilian said,referring to China’s donating the vaccine doses to the Philippines.He expressed hope the arrival of the vaccines from China would kick off the Philippines’ nationwide inoculation program.A Chinese military transport plane will deliver the cargo of CoronaVac doses at the Villamor Air Base, according to a retired Filipino-Chinese official who requested anonymity.Sinovac general manager Helen Yang has confirmed the arrival this week of the vaccines now allowed for local application by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) through an emergency use authorization (EUA).“After we have the EUA issuance, we cleared everything from the approval side and now we need to complete the schedule of delivery and custom procedures that would normally take a few days,” she explained.Yang has also said Sinovac is “in close communication” with the Chinese embassy regarding the delivery of the vaccines.Upon their arrival, the vaccine doses would be loaded onto refrigerated vans – after undergoing customs procedures – and transported to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City.Despite the confirmation of the date of the vaccines’ arrival, the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force against COVID-19 (NTF) said a vaccine rollout is still being finalized.“Specific details as to the allocation and subsequent rollout of the 600,000 donated Sinovac doses are still being evaluated pending the official recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and its approval by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF),” a joint DOH-NTF statement read.“Details of the planned arrival ceremony are still currently being finalized in close coordination with the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China,” the NTF said.Yesterday, DOH reported that confirmed COVID cases nationwide jumped to 568,680 with the addition of 2,269 cases.Out of the total cases, DOH said 92.2 percent or 524,042 have survived the infection, including 738 additional recoveries.Active cases stand at 32,437, accounting for 5.7 percent of total cases. The bulk or 94.5 percent of the active cases are mild and asymptomatic.With additional 72 deaths, COVID-related fatalities rose to 12,201. The figure represents 2.15 percent of total cases.Health workers’ turnAnti-COVID task force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. said he hopes the arrival on Sunday of the vaccines would make possible the inoculation of medical frontliners by the first week of March.He confirmed a Chinese military aircraft would deliver the vaccines.Galvez also noted that some mayors, including Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, have volunteered to be vaccinated with Sinovac in public to boost the people’s confidence in the vaccine.Presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said 100,000 of the 600,000 doses scheduled to arrive on Sunday would be administered to soldiers and policemen.It was not clear whether President Duterte would push through with plans to personally welcome the shipment of vaccines at the airport.Roque could not tell the actual date of inoculation of medical frontliners but has told Philippine General Hospital chief Dr. Gap Legaspi that there might be a need to prepare those who have consented to get inoculated by Monday.“I will have to coordinate. But I know, all we need is one day and then we will roll out. So, if it arrives on Sunday, if I am not mistaken, then we can rollout on Monday, because many of our fellow countrymen are already very excited,” he said.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, meanwhile, again made a pitch for vaccination, saying it could at least protect an individual from getting severe case of COVID-19 even if it could not make him totally immune to the virus.“Number one, it will reduce death. Number two, it will reduce symptomatic cases, you can prevent the symptoms such as cough, fever and flu,” he said, explaining the vaccines’ benefits.“And it will prevent progression to severe form of COVID-19 infection. And, therefore, prevent hospitalization,” he said.Pitching for SinovacDuque said vaccines developed by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Sinovac have 100 percent efficacy rate in preventing severe COVID infection.“That’s the most important because deaths involved only those with severe cases,” he said.“So, if you are able to prevent severe infection, there will be no death. And Sinovac belongs to that group that offers or provides 100 percent efficacy or effectiveness. So I am not surprised that some countries, despite the indications in the issued emergency use authorization, they opted to still include their health care workers within the age group of 18 to 59 years,” Duque told the President at the IATF meeting on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the Department of Finance (DOF) has approved the inclusion of all COVID-19 vaccine imports under its Mabuhay express lane to expedite clearance of shipments and processing of tax and duty exemptions.Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III also approved the waiving of filing fees for vaccine applications under the Mabuhay Lane and the use of the Tax Exemption System (TES) Online Filing Module in processing of imports “to further support the government’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program.”Tax exemptions in the express lane, which is under the DOF’s revenue office, will be processed within 24 working hours.DOF said these tax exemption policies will be incorporated in the inter-agency guidelines for the implementation of a One-Stop Shop for International Donations and Government Procured COVID-19 Vaccines prepared by the DOF, DOH, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Bureau of Customs (BOC) and the FDA.Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko recommended the inclusion of COVID-19 vaccine imports in the express lane “regardless of the applicable legal basis,” to “allow for the expedited processing of the tax and exemption of such applications.”The finance chief is authorized to include additional sectors that may avail themselves of the express service under the Mabuhay Lane.Vaccines donated to government agencies and accredited private entities would also be processed in the express lane.“We add that the Mabuhay Lane currently processes all Relief Consignment under Section 120 in relation to 121 of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA). The Lane is expected to process all COVID-19 vaccines which may qualify as relief consignment,” said Tionko.Under the CMTA, relief consignment imported during a state of calamity and intended for the use of calamity victims shall be exempted from the payment of duties and taxes.The Mabuhay Lane was established to expedite the processing of applications for the tax and duty exemption of certain groups of importers, including export-oriented firms, returning residents, as well as non-profit, non-stock educational institutions. – Christina Mendez, Mayen Jaymalin, Neil Jayson Servallos, Czeriza Valencia",Philstar

The drug regulator later clarified that medical frontliners are not prohibited to receive the vaccine if they want to. According to late stage trials in Brazil involving health workers who have had exposure to COVID-19 cases, the jabs yielded only a 50.4% efficacy rate.Vergeire stressed the recommendation of the FDA was not a question of vaccine safety but a “question of rational use of available resources.”The FDA said the vaccine can be given to “clinically healthy” adults aged 18 to 59 after it was found to have an efficacy rate of 65.3% in clinical trials held in Indonesia and 91.25% in the study conducted in Turkey. Health workers’ choiceHealth experts emphasized it is for the medical frontliners to decide whether they will take the Sinovac shot or not and that the prioritization framework will still be followed.Health workers are at the top of the government’s priority list for vaccination. “Vaccination with the incoming Sinovac donation is voluntary... If they are hesitant to accept this vaccine, then they can wait for the next available vaccine but we don’t know when that would be,” Dr. Nina Castillo-Carandang, NITAG member, said. Dr. Edsel Salvana, member of the DOH TAG, said the vaccine “looks like it will save lives” and it is right to offer the available jab to the frontliners. “If they feel this is not the right vaccine for them, then we are not going to penalize them. They are still first in line for either Pfizer or AstraZeneca,” he said. The initial doses of 600,000—which are donated by vaccine—are expected to arrive in the country on Sunday.",Philstar

""Both teams have been working round the clock to make it happen,"" he said, referring to the Philippines and China.""A friend in need is a friend indeed. The donation of vaccines is another testament to the solidarity as well as profound friendship and partnership between our two peoples and two countries,"" he also said.Roque said inoculations could begin immediately by March 1 with personnel of the Philippine General Hospital to be the first to receive it.While the Food and Drug Administration has issued an Emergency Use Approval to Sinovac, the local regulator advised against using it on medical workers as it yielded a 50% efficacy rate in clinical trials involving hospital personnel in Brazil.Despite this, Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, PGH director, said hospital personnel have signed uo to receive the Sinovac vaccines.""Our basis for accepting this is the EUA given by the FDA, because we all know that if it gives clearance, the safety and efficacy are assured,"" he said, partly in Filipino.Last week, the PGH said 94% of their employees have registered to receive the vaccine, which was 75% higher than their initial survey in January. Dr. Jonas del Rosario, PGH spokesperson, said vaccination could start as soon as Monday. The recent days have seen experts stressing on the public to trust the FDA's standards in issuing emergency use approvals. This came amid uncertainties over Sinovac's efficacy rate, as well as survey results showing that only 19% of adult Filipinos are willing to be vaccinated.Findings by the OCTA Research team released on Wednesday showed that 46% of respondents said they would opt out of receiving vaccines, which was not far from the 47% in Pulse Asia's poll just last month.READ: Less than a fifth of adult Filipinos willing to get COVID-19 jabs — OCTALegaspi added: ""The important thing to remember here is whatever vaccine comes, we should welcome it because it will make a difference in controling the spread of this infection, and I think the first area where we should control it is in the hospital.""Health workers are at the top of government's priority list of sectors to be vaccinated.Apart from the 600,000 donated doses of Sinovac, the administration signed a term sheet with the manufacturer for 25 million more doses.Pfizer and AstraZeneca's vaccines from the COVAX facility were supposedly the first to arrive in the Philippines with officials touting an indicative date by mid-February. Palace officials have sought to play down the delays, with the president's lawyer even saying that a few more days of waiting would not matter.Just a few days before February ends, the Philippines has over 566,000 coronavirus cases with deaths at more than 12,000. The said count remains the second highest in Southeast Asia, and the more infectious COVID-19 variant is already in the country along with two mutations detected.Nothing final yet, yet againThe health department and the national task force on the pandemic on Thursday afternoon clarified that vaccination might not actually start by March 1 as the Palace claimed.In a joint statement, officials said ""specific details as to the allocation and subsequent rollout"" of the 600,000 doses are still being evaluated by the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and would need to be approved by the policy-setting IATF.While they also also confirmed that the vaccines would arrive in the coming days, details on the welcoming ceremony are also still being ironed out with the Chinese Embassy.The clarification hours after Roque's briefing was similar to how he said government would begin vaccinations by February 15, only later on to backtrack. Days later, the health department would also say that the given date was not definite.",Philstar

But it is not an idea of the President. It is the idea of (Labor) Secretary (Silvestre) Bello (III) and (Foreign Affairs) Secretary (Teodoro) Locsin (Jr.) and we welcome it because more is better than less,” Roque said at a press briefing yesterday.The DOLE said the negotiation to secure vaccines from the UK and Germany is meant to protect the HCWs set for deployment abroad.“DOLE wishes to correct the sort of misquoted notion by some quarters about the intentions of sending or lifting of the cap in the number of nurses being requested by the UK and Germany. DOLE does not intend to treat our nurses as a commodity to be traded for vaccines,” DOLE information and public service director Rolly Francia said.Considering the generosity of the UK and German governments, Francia expressed DOLE’s belief that these countries would provide more vaccines for those they would hire and workers intending to seek employment abroad.The Department of Health (DOH) for its part said it was not consulted over a reported plan to trade off health workers for COVID-19 vaccines.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they were not even aware of such exchange between our “government and other governments for this matter.”“We think if there is such kind of negotiation, this should be presented to the Inter-Agency Task Force so the IATF could decide on this,” Vergeire said.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon scored the DOLE for the supposed barter plan of HCWs, saying the move is a sign of desperation.Drilon said the DOLE’s palit bakuna initiative is a wrong policy and sets a bad precedent.“For the government to go this far as trading off its Filipino health care workers in exchange for vaccines means something is not right in the government’s coronavirus vaccination strategy,” he said. –  Alexis Romero, Mayen Jaymalin, Sheila Crisostomo, Paolo Romero, Delon Porcalla",Philstar

It is not clear yet, though, what vaccine brand will be inoculated to them.VSMMC is one of the priorities in the vaccination program of the national government, it being a COVID-19 government hospital.The science behindAccording to the World Health Organization, vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with the body’s natural defenses to build protection. When a person gets a vaccine, his or her immune system responds.It recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria, and produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease.The immune system then remembers the disease and how to fight it. If the person is then exposed to the germ in the future, his or her immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.The vaccine, WHO says, is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness.""Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective.

The product has already been prepared so we just need to finalize the procedures with the customs then we can fix the date of the flight,” Yang said.“We will try our best to see if we can deliver the products in this week or next week. It will be very soon,” she added.The government initially announced that the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines would be on February 15, a date that has since been pushed back. President Rodrigo Duterte wants to be present when doses of the Sinovac jab arrive in the country, his spokesperson said Wednesday.Beijing committed to donate 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine known as CoronaVac despite questions and concerns over its varying efficacy rates. Of these, 100,000 will be allocated to military personnel. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said Chinese authorities would need three to five days to prepare the vaccine shipment once an Emergency Use Authorization is issued. The country’s FDA granted an EUA to CoronaVac Monday.The vaccine can be given to “clinically healthy” adults aged 18 to 59 but was not recommended for healthcare workers or the elderly.FDA Director General Eric Domingo explained that Sinovac is not the most ideal vaccine for medical frontliners because they are constantly exposed to COVID-19 patients.According to late stage trials in Brazil involving health workers who have had exposure to COVID-19 cases, the jabs yielded only a 50.4% efficacy rate—just above the World Health Organization’s threshold for vaccine use.Aside from Sinovac, the FDA has also issued EUAs to the vaccine of Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca. But so far, none have been shipped to the Philippines and the government is facing criticisms over the delayed vaccine rollout.The Philippine government earlier signed a term sheet with the Chinese drugmaker for 25 million doses of its vaccine.",Philstar

He said he wanted to test the vaccine on himself because he was applying to be a local Sinopharm distributor.Related StoriesFDA approves compassionate use license on vaccines for PSG personnelMon Tulfo admits getting inoculated with smuggled Sinopharm shots, eyes local distributorshipThe columnist said he took the vaccine with some “Cabinet-level” officials, a senator and some members of the Presidential Security Group.The vaccine developed by a Chinese state-owned biotech firm has no authorization for emergency use in the Philippines. It has not even submitted application for such approval.FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the unauthorized vaccination activity will be referred to the agency’s regulatory enforcement unit for investigation.“We are investigating this because it is not good that we learn that there are individuals who get vaccinated without going through the right process,” Domingo said in a Laging Handa briefing Wednesday.In a separate briefing, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the ongoing probe into illegal vaccination activities will also include Tulfo.Agencies launched probes into the Presidential Security Group’s use of unregistered COVID-19 vaccines last year. Domingo said the FDA has yet to receive response from President Rodrigo Duterte’s security detail about their queries.The use of unregistered vaccines violates the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009, which prohibits the distribution and administering of vaccines not yet approved by regulatory authorities.The DOH and the FDA have been saying that the use of unregistered products poses harm to a person’s health and safety.Local distributorTulfo said he has applied to be a local distributor of Sinopharm with a company called “Apollo.” He said the firm supposedly secured a contract with a Singapore subsidiary of Sinopharm.He denied using his position as special envoy to apply for local distributorship and secure vaccine doses for himself, his drivers and his bodyguards.Vergeire said individuals who are supplying illegally procured COVID-19 shots will be investigated. “If there will be violations, there will be sanctions.”Conflict of interestIn a briefing, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque avoided commenting on whether or not there is conflict of interest in Tulfo’s application to be a local distributor of the  Sinopharm vaccine.“We have no opinion whatsoever. We leave that to the ombudsman,” Roque said. He added he did not know about the columnist's claim that the president got in touch with a representative of Sinopharm. “I don’t understand the big deal about the Mon Tulfo write-up. That’s an account of Mon Tulfo. If you want verification, please contact Mon Tulfo,” he also said. When asked if the Palace found the admission of unauthorized vaccination alarming, the presidential spokesperson replied: ""I don’t have any reaction to that because I understand that during a pandemic, many want to have protection. But we’re telling everybody to wait for the product to undergo the proper process.""Tulfo argued there is no conflict of interest because he is a “private citizen,” claiming he is “technically not a government official” because his position as special envoy is only “honorific.”In December last year, Duterte revealed that PSG members already got vaccinated against COVID-19 even if the FDA has yet to issue an EUA at the time. Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante, PSG commander, confirmed it, leaving health authorities surprised and the public enraged.The FDA eventually issued a “compassionate use license” for the president’s security detail to take 10,000 Sinopharm shots last February 11.Three vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the Philippines—Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac—but so far none have been delivered and the government is under criticism over the delayed vaccine rollout.",Philstar

Bong Go yesterday stressed the need for experts to ensure the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to allay fears and help improve public confidence in the National COVID-19 Vaccine Roadmap, while emphasizing that government authorities are doing their best to secure sufficient supply of vaccines for the country.In a statement, Go also urged experts, such as those in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to provide clear explanations to the public on the steps and precautions being taken to ensure that lives will be protected when the vaccine program is rolled out.“Plans and decisions must be carefully explained to heighten public trust and allay fears on the vaccines. Let us not disregard our fellowmen who do not know where to get vaccine or those who don’t even know what and for where these vaccines are,” he said in Filipino as a reminder to authorities.The senator also appealed to the public to trust health experts and rely on credible sources of information to be aware and to fully understand why vaccination is crucial in overcoming the pandemic toward full recovery.“Let us trust our government because it is doing everything to protect the lives of every Filipino,” he said.Meanwhile, Go is asking for an explanation from the FDA on its decision to not recommend the use of China’s Sinovac vaccine on medical frontliners.In an ambush interview right after he distributed assistance to market and ambulant vendors in Baclaran, Parañaque City, the senator said FDA director general Eric Domingo should explain to the public why they have to set such conditions and why they choose the type of vaccines that will be used by health workers.“I will ask FDA director general Eric Domingo why there are such conditions. This must be cleared before the public to avoid confusion or fear among the people on why vaccines are chosen,” he said.Go’s statement came after Domingo disclosed that they have approved the emergency use authorization (EUA) of Sinovac vaccines in the Philippines, but would not recommend the use of this brand on medical frontliners due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4 percent, based on clinical trials worldwide.National Task Force against COVID-19 (NTF) chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said a total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines would be donated to the Philippines by the Chinese government. The Philippines also plans to buy more doses from Sinovac on top of what will be donated.While awaiting the vaccine rollout, Go reminded the public to remain vigilant, cooperate with authorities and trust that the government is doing everything it can to overcome the ongoing health crisis.He also appealed for understanding from the public for the difficulties encountered in securing the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines and emphasized that the government is doing its best to fast-track the procurement of the vaccines.“The government is doing everything, Secretary Galvez is doing everything. The problem here is the supply of vaccines all over the world,” Go said.Barring any hitches, the government remains hopeful that the over 500,000 Sinovac vaccines from China will be arriving in the country three to five days after the FDA granted the EUA of the Chinese vaccine manufacturer.Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles made the announcement after the government missed its original schedule of arrival for the Sinovac vaccines yesterday.The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, along with the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, has been assured of the vaccines’ arrival shortly after the issuance of the EUA. – Sheila Crisostomo, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Michael Punongbayan",Philstar

The HCWs, particularly nurses, are highly in demand in European countries due to the aging population.While DOLE is still waiting for feedback, Visperas is optimistic that the requests will be granted. The UK government, she said, is expected to send a response within the week.If the UK and Germany will agree to provide vaccines, DOLE will use them for OFWs who were displaced by the pandemic as well as those who will be going back abroad, she added.Visperas explained that Bello wanted to secure the vaccines for OFWs because vaccination is now becoming a common requirement for entering foreign migrants.Some Philippine Overseas Labor Offices (POLOs) reported that a number of destination countries for OFWs are no longer accepting migrants not vaccinated against COVID, she said.Based on DOLE data, over 570,000 OFWs were displaced by the pandemic, thus the need to secure at least 600,000 vaccines from UK and Germany.Meanwhile, the country’s discussions with Russia on the possible purchase of COVID-19 vaccines are now at a “very advanced stage,” said Manila’s envoy to Moscow Ambassador Carlos Sorreta.He noted that the vaccines would be acquired through a government-to-government commercial agreement and not through donation because the Duterte administration is ready to pay for the COVID-19 shots.“Our discussions on a technical level with Russia are in a very advanced stage. Right now, we are waiting for additional information, technical data being sought by the Philippines. Once it is obtained, I think that’s the final step for our FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to make a decision,” Sorreta said at a press briefing.“And once they make a decision, the Russian side is ready to sit down and sign, which they have done already with 30 countries, and there are 50 other counties lined up. So I think that’s the next step… If we make a decision soon and give the approval, I think the vaccines can come in a fairly quick amount of time,” he added.He noted that it is hard to give a timeline for the procurement but the Philippines is constantly following up on the information it is seeking from Russia.Russia has offered to supply the Philippines Sputnik V vaccines developed by Gamaleya Research Institute. Sorreta said the Russian vaccine is available commercially in that country and some Filipinos have availed themselves of it.“If you go to a private doctor, you can avail of it... Aside from medical centers in our areas, they set up vaccination facilities in the malls. Filipinos frequent malls and perhaps after shopping or eating at the food court, they drop by the vaccination center,” the envoy said. – Alexis Romero",Philstar

They are the people working in industries that remained open while we were under ECQ (enhanced community quarantine),” the Palace spokesman said in Filipino.“Our vaccination will continue, it won’t be disrupted.If we cannot give them to seniors and health care workers, we have many critical economic frontliners who can be vaccinated,” he added.Roque said the poor could also be inoculated if the supply agreement involving the procurement of one million Sinovac doses pushes through.“We did not choose this but look, we really have a God who says that the poor in the Philippines should be prioritized in the vaccines,” he added.He revealed that the 75-year-old Duterte has expressed preference for COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Sinopharm, also a Chinese firm.Earlier this month, the FDA allowed the compassionate use of 10,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccines for members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) and their families.PSG chief Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III had admitted that some of Duterte’s security aides had been inoculated against COVID-19 as early as September last year.

My understanding is there’s no requirement in the case of AstraZeneca for further exchange of letters between the manufacturer and the Philippines,” said Rabindra Abeyashinge, WHO country representative.The Philippines is expected to receive around 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine this year.“What we're looking at now is accelerating the delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines at least a part of the shipment to the Philippines,” he said. The WHO official also said the “impasse” between the Philippines and American vaccine manufacturer Pfizer on the delivery of much awaited COVID-19 shots may be resolved soon after the government received a side letter from the drugmaker. A side letter is a document used as a supplementary to a contract.“We believe that within the day today or tomorrow or whenever the legal teams have cleared those documents, we will see a resolution of that impasse and maybe there will be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe said.Three vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the Philippines—Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac—but so far none have been delivered and the government is under criticism over the delayed vaccine rollout.Officials said the delivery of 117,000 doses of vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech faced delays due to requirements such as indemnification.‘No link to Dengvaxia’Abeyasinghe also said the requirement of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers for the Philippines to submit indemnification agreements is not connected to the country’s experience with Dengvaxia.Last week, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said drugmakers were concerned with the country’s previous experiences with anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia. The government submitted indemnification agreements to access vaccine doses through the COVAX facility.But Abeyasinghe clarified that the “requirements and the standard agreements are common to all countries.”“They’re not specific to the Philippines and they’re not related to any issue that happened in the country relating to Dengvaxia or anything else,” Abeyasinghe said.“The indemnification clause is something manufacturers are demanding from every country irrespective of whether they are buying from manufacturers or whether they are receiving vaccines through the COVAX facility or some other mechanism,” he added.The controversy was highly politicized despite the lack of conclusive evidence that the vaccine developed by French firm Sanofi Pasteur caused the deaths of children inoculated with it during the previous administration.The fiasco also eroded public trust in life-saving vaccines. A survey of pollster Pulse Asia released last month showed nearly half of Filipinos would opt out of inoculation. — Gaea Katreena Cabico",Philstar

Sonny Angara called “regulatory barriers.”Among these is the provision which allows the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to buy COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies for its storage, transport and deployment through negotiated procurement instead of public bidding.It also allows local government units to buy COVID-19 vaccines through a tripartite agreement with the national government and the supplier of the shot. Private entities may also purchase their own vaccines through the same way.The bill also provides that COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies will be exempted from customs duties, value-added tax, excise tax, donor’s tax and other fees and charges.It also directs the DOH to issue a vaccine passport to all Filipinos which would contain basic personal information, the COVID-19 vaccine given to them, and the health facility where the shot was received.The bill initially suggested that those who have completed COVID-19 immunization may be granted perks, but this was dropped in the final measure.",Philstar

The rating was only slightly higher than the World Health Organization's threshhold for deciding on vaccine use.Efficacies of same vaccine vary depending on test group This was backed by Dr. Rontgene Solante, an infectious diseases expert at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.Speaking to ONE News' ""The Chiefs"" on Monday night, he explained that vaccines have different efficacies depending on the group of individuals it was tested on. ""In this particular study (Brazil), they found out that the efficacy among these high-risk health workers is really low,"" he said. ""That's the beauty of a Phase 3 clinical trial, you will be able to know and look at [the] efficacy of the vaccines in different target population.""The clinical trials in Jakarta and Ankara involved volunteers from various fields, while the one in Brasilia was concentrated on medical personnel. Solante said the 50.4% efficacy was from a study focused on high-risk health workers who face different levels of exposure than regular people do.""If you are a frontliner and you are seeing patients... perhaps your risk could be at 50 to 60%,"" Solante said partly in Filipino. ""But if you are in the general population and not working in a hospital, your risk is really lower than that of health workers.""Hospital personnel are at the top of government's priority list to be vaccinated for the coronavirus, followed by senior citizens, the indigenous and marginalized as well as the police and military.Already, the Philippines is set to receive some 600,000 doses of Sinovac as a donation from Beijing, while the administration has signed a term sheet with the company for 25 million more doses.'Trust the experts'The arrival of other brands of vaccines, however, is facing significant delays particularly the 117,000 doses of Pfizer and 5.5 million of AstraZeneca from the COVAX facility.""We are placing our health workers and elderly people at further risk every day in the delay of the vaccine procurement,"" said Rep. Carlos Zarate (Bayan Muna party-list). ""This dilly-dallying affects not only our economy but also the very lives of our people.""House Minority Leader Joseph Stephen Paduano (Abang Lingkod party-list) warned too that the FDA's approval of Sinovac for emergency use while advising against its use on health workers and senior citizens has further ""eroded public trust and confidence in inoculation.""Paduano sought clarification from health authorities on the issue. In a television interview, Dr. Lulu Bravo, who is the executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, stressed that experts have studied vaccines they have granted EUAs for.""It is the vaccine experts who really looked and investigated all the studies,"" she told ""Headstart"" on ANC. ""[They] were there, they really looked at the data and as I have always mentioned, we have to trust the experts.""Aside from securing the jabs amid a global race, the Philippines has had to struggle with ramping up the public's trust on getting vaccinated once the doses arrive.It came after a Pulse Asia survey in January revealed that 47% said they would not be inoculated with most of them concerned on its safety.Adding to doubts on Sinovac is criticism of the government for seeming to favor the Chinese-made jabs over others that have reported higher efficacy rates.To date, Sinovac has yet to submit its Phase 3 clinical trial data to medical journals for peer review, unlike its competitors Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna.Despite the concerns, Bravo maintained that the ""best vaccine is the one that will be available to you [that] is approved by the experts.""""I have seen how they have discussed and painfully debate all the issues that are here,"" she said.

Beijing committed to donate 600,000 doses of the Chinese-made coronavirus jab, of which 100,000 will be allocated to military personnel. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Monday that the Chinese Embassy in Manila need three to five days to prepare the vaccine shipment once EUA is issued. The EUA will be valid only within the duration of the declared public health emergency or upon the issuance of certificate of product registration, which is the typical license issued to products. Not best vaccine for health workersThe authorization clears CoronaVac for use on “clinically healthy” individuals aged 18 and 59 years after it was found to have an efficacy rate of 65.3% in clinical trials held in Indonesia and 91.25% in the study conducted in Turkey. But late-stage trials in Brazil had shown an efficacy rate of 50.4%—just above the threshold the World Health Organization uses to decide if a vaccine is worth using. Brazil conducted trials with healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients only.""The use of Sinovac vaccine on healthcare workers is not recommended,"" Domingo said, explaining that CoronaVac is not the most ideal vaccine to administer to medical frontliners because of their constant exposure to the virus.Medical frontliners are at the top of the government's priority list for COVID-19 vaccination. Aside from them, senior citizens, indigent population and uniformed personnel are also among the priority groups. “The safety profile is good, adverse events were mild to moderate. The possibility of allergy and severe allergy or anaphylaxis is minimal,” the FDA chief said in a mix of English and Filipino. Unlike competitor vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, Sinovac has yet to submit Phase 3 clinical trial data to medical journals for peer review. The AstraZeneca shot was found to be 70% effective on average. Meanwhile, COVID-19 jabs from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna reported 95% and 94.1% efficacy rates, respectively. Sinovac shots can be stored at around 2°C, which is the standard temperature that is within the existing cold chain system in the country.The Philippine government earlier signed a term sheet with the Chinese drugmaker for 25 million doses of its vaccine. It is aiming to secure a total of 146 to 148 million vaccine doses to inoculate at least 50 million people this year alone, but it has yet to execute definitive supply agreements with pharmaceutical companies. — with a report from Agence France-Presse",Philstar

Not necessarily, says expert",Sheila Crisostomo,2021-02-21 00:00:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Vaccines for COVID-19 do not necessarily prevent infection and transmission of the virus but it could protect those inoculated against severe illness, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday night.Enrique Tayag, DOH director for Knowledge Management and IT Service, explained that clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines are not yet finished but these were released by manufacturers through an emergency use authorization (EUA) issued by regulatory authorities of countries.This means that people can still get infected although “there will be no severe COVID-19,” he said in an interview with The Chiefs on Cignal TV’s OneNews.“(From) what we know...it proves that it protects against severe COVID-19 and prevents hospitalization,” the former DOH chief epidemiologist added in reference to the case of a 43-year-old overseas Filipino worker in Mandaue City in Cebu.The OFW had two doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine while still in the United Arab Emirates. He went though a 14-day quarantine after arriving in Cebu. However, when tested before flying back to the UAE, he turned positive for the virus.Four of his household members were also found infected, although it could not be ascertained if they got the virus from him.Tayag said that “timing is important for vaccination” as a person could already be “incubating” the infection when vaccinated. He also underscored the need to get the complete two shots to acquire maximum protection.A 24-year-old OFW from Canada also tested positive for COVID-19 after arriving in Cebu last Feb. 9. She was swab tested on Feb. 14, the fifth day of her quarantine, and found positive. It turned out that she was given her first dose of Pfizer vaccine last Jan. 13 in Canada but failed to get the second dose.Meanwhile, the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is targeting to inoculate close to 1,000 health care personnel and non-medical workers per day once the vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech arrives.Hospital director Gerardo Legaspi said that, based on their simulation, they could give shots to 975 individuals per day.“If we want to vaccinate 975 people – because one tray per day – we will need nine vaccinators and 54 monitoring (seats),” he said at a recent briefing organized by the Department of Health.Based on pre-registration, at least 94.1 percent or 5,745 of the 6,316 workers PGH workers have signed up for vaccination. These are composed of health workers, non-medical personnel, student-interns and consultants, among others, regardless of employment status.According to Legaspi, the simulation revealed they could inoculate six people per vial with the “saline solution” they are using. However, to get six doses from one vial, they would have to use “low-dead space syringes.”The PGH, he said, is having difficulty in finding a supplier for this syringe type.He also foresees a “big bottleneck” in the screening procedures and recommended that the DOH allow them to forego blood pressure screening for those who are not hypertensive.“Taking BP and pulse takes time. If they are not hypertensive to begin with, maybe we can (do away with it),” Legaspi explained.He noted that their registration activities allowed them to know the quantity of vaccines needed and to do “eligibility checks.”",Philstar

It is also possible for one of the chambers to simply adopt the other house’s version.The arrival of doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccines from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility was delayed due to the need for an indemnity program that provides that the government, and not the manufacturers, would be held liable for adverse effects due to the shots.Senators on Wednesday said that if they had been informed of the need for an indemnity fund sooner, they would have addressed it.

MANILA – Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go is eyeing the presidential seat next year, President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday.
Duterte made the announcement when he introduced Go during the inauguration of the newly-constructed Port Operations Building at the Port of Dumaguete in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.
In his speech, he said Go had asked him a favor to tell the public about the lawmaker’s supposed plan to join the 2022 presidential race.
“Itong si Senator Bong Go, pababa kami sa eroplano, sabi niya na ‘Sir, may hingin sana ako saýo ng pabor.’ Sabi ko, ‘Ano?’ Sabi niya, ‘Medyo, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth, malayo pa pero ikaw na lang ang mag-sabi sa kanila.’ Sabihin ko, ang totoo talaga, isang bagay lang. Sabihin daw sa inyo, gusto niya maging president (Senator Bong Go, when we were about to disembark from the plane, said, ‘Sir, I have a favor to ask.’ I asked him, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘It somehow leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it’s still far but I want you to tell them.’ I will tell you the truth. He wants me to tell you that he wants to be president),” Duterte said, drawing cheers from the crowd.
It was, however, unclear whether he was serious when he made the remarks.
Go, who joined the event, was seen shaking his head in disapproval.
Duterte’s latest statement came despite Go’s insistence that he is not gunning for the presidency in 2022.
It also came amid calls for Go and Duterte to run for president and vice president, respectively.
Earlier Thursday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque recalled Duterte’s previous statement that the Chief Executive has no plan to become the country’s next vice president next year.
Sal Panelo as ‘good senator someday’
Meanwhile, Duterte also hinted at the possibility that his top lawyer, Chief Presidential Legal Counsel, might seek a seat at the Senate in the 2022 national and local elections.
This was after Duterte alluded that Panelo could be a “good senator” in the future.
He also praised Panelo’s credentials, noting that the Palace official’s former clients include celebrities.

The Bicol region received on March 10 a total of 22,000 doses of AztraZeneca vaccines intended for government hospital healthcare workers in various local government units that have already submitted the requirements based on the DOH deployment criteria.

LEGAZPI CITY – The Department of Health (DOH) in Bicol urged the provincial health institutions and local government units (LGUs) in the region to conduct simulation exercises (SIMEX) for the vaccination procedure as a requirement for vaccine allocation.
This, after 22,000 doses in 2,200 vials of the AstraZeneca vaccine arrived here on Wednesday.
Dr. John Ferchito Avelino, DOH-Bicol assistant regional director, in a press conference said SIMEX must be conducted to ensure and assess the preparation of people, venue and facilities to be used when the actual vaccines arrive.
""LGUs and hospital must prepare facilities, vaccination workforce, referral facility for adverse effects, and list of eligible individuals to be vaccinated in the localities. DOH will also look into the venue lay-out, process and contingency plan just in case for adverse events like brownout, earthquake and other natural calamities,"" Avelino said.
He also reminded LGUs to coordinate with the DOH for the conduct of the SIMEX in their areas.
Based on DOH-Bicol data, four LGUs in Bicol have conducted SIMEX. These are the provincial governments of Sorsogon, Camarines Sur and Catanduanes and city government of Legazpi for Albay.
""Masbate will conduct (SIMEX) on March 12 and Camarines Norte will be on next Monday,"" Avelino said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Rita Ang-Bon, DOH-Bicol vaccination program coordinator, said the new batch of vaccines that arrived is intended for government hospital healthcare workers in various LGUs that have submitted the requirements based on the DOH deployment criteria.
Ang-Bon said the deployment protocols include availability of storage facility, and list of referral facilities and vaccine recipients including a pre-assessment study that determines who are willing to be vaccinated, health workers who wanted to be inoculated but are ineligible because they are senior citizens, and those who are suffering from comorbidities.
When asked about the deployment of the AstraZeneca vaccines, she said they could not yet determine the allocation per province as they are still waiting for the list from the Covid-19 referral hospitals across the region.
Noemi Bron, DOH public affairs chief, said the arrival of the vaccines contained in three cooler boxes was supervised by medical staff of the agency who immediately transferred the cargo to a waiting refrigerated cargo van at the airport tarmac.
A convoy of police and health workers transported the cargo to the DOH storage facility here for inventory and safekeeping.
The new delivery is part of the 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca that arrived last week in Manila from COVAX, the global vaccine pool recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
A vial of the AstraZeneca vaccine developed by the Oxford University can inoculate 10 people with an efficacy rate of 62-90 percent.
Bicol Region earlier received 12,000 doses of CoronaVac vaccines developed by Beijing-based Sinovac pharmaceutical firm.
The vaccination procedure using the medicines from China started on Wednesday in three government-run hospitals in Sorsogon province that received an initial 960 single-dose vials of Sinovac.
Bron said the initial allocation delivered to Sorsogon was intended for government health workers at the Sorsogon Provincial Hospital, Metro Health Specialist Inc., and Sorsogon Medical Mission Group Hospital and Health Services Cooperative.
The vaccine rollout was conducted after the three hospitals completed their vaccine simulation procedures. (PNA)

MANILA – The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) on Wednesday reported that almost 500,000 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) who were displaced by the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic have been assisted by the government and are now in their home provinces.
“As of March 10, we have 470,000 OFWs. It is approaching the half a million mark of those that we have sent to their home regions by the OWWA and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and it is also an inter-agency effort,” OWWA administrator Hans Leo Cacdac said in a virtual forum.
Cacdac also said the government continues to provide assistance to returning OFWs which include free swab testing, food and accommodation, and transportation to their home regions.
“Upon orders of the President, swab testing or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) testing of arriving OFW is free, the quarantine hotel facility including food is also free and also the transportation to their home regions,” he added.
At the same time, Cacdac also reported that at present, there are some 10,000 OFWs that are in 150 hotel facilities, who are waiting for their scheduled transportation back to their provinces.
He said the government is spending PHP30,000 a day, based on the estimated maximum cost of hotel accommodation per night at PHP3,000.
“I will give you an estimate, the maximum cost per night in a hotel is around PHP3,000. It could be less depending on the classification of the hotel. If it’s five-star, maximum of PHP3,000 per night and then if lesser degree than five-star, less than PHP3,000, and then we have around 10,000 OFWs right now. So our projected daily cost is PHP3,000 times 10,000,” the OWWA head added.
Cacdac said the figure only covers the accommodation and does not include the food and transportation expenses.
“It does not include food and transportation. It’s only for hotel accommodations. Of course, included in the hotel accommodations, the food while they are there. There are other food costs, for example, if they have been transported to the airport they will be provided with food. If they will be brought to the bus terminal, they will be given food,” he added.
Cacdac, however, said they cannot give an estimate on how many more OFWs are expected to return to the country.
“It’s difficult to say since the situation right now is fluid because of the vaccine. That will depend on the extent and the efficacy of the vaccination program of countries worldwide, so I want to say 80,000 to 100,000 in the course of the year but I think that is dependent on how the vaccination program of the whole world. The computation for this year will change because of the vaccination phenomenon,"" he added.

MANILA – Navotas Mayor Toby Tiangco reminded his constituents anew that wearing face masks at all times outside their home would help contain the community transmission of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).

Cesar Hawthorne Binag, to increase police deployment and strictly enforce minimum public health standards in Navotas, Pasay, Malabon, Cebu City, and Cebu province, which have recently registered a spike in Covid-19 infections.
Tiangco said the city government has been receiving numerous complaints on the improper wearing of face masks and violation of curfew hours among minors in Navotas.
He ordered barangay officials to strictly implement Covid-19 protocols in their respective villages.
""Gusto po nating manatiling ligtas ang bawat mamamayan kaya hinihingi po namin ang inyong pakikiisa (We want to keep our residents safe from Covid-19, that's why we are appealing for your cooperation),"" Tiangco told his constituents.
He said residents should not disregard the prevailing threat of Covid-19.
The city government on Tuesday issued a memorandum order to implement a three-strike policy on flagging down violators of health protocols amid the pandemic.
The memorandum stated that the three-strike policy would be enforced in a barangay ""if the Task Force Disiplina or the Philippine National Police (PNP) is able to flag down more violators in a particular barangay than the barangay authorities themselves.”
“If this occurs three times, the undersigned (Tiangco) shall refer the gross neglect of duty on the part of the barangay to strictly implement existing ordinances of the City to the Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Council),” the order read.
Tiangco said the city government imposes granular lockdowns on villages that are at high risk of Covid-19.
""Ayaw na po natin na maghigpit ng buong siyudad ng Navotas ngunit kung mangyayari ay tataas po ang kaso ay magsasara po tayo ng barangay, magla-lockdown po tayo ng barangay (We don't want to restrict the whole Navotas City but if the Covid-19 cases continue to increase, we will impose a barangay lockdown),"" he said.

 Meanwhile, Dizon said the government has not yet released any budget for the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines as those that arrived in the country were donations from the Chinese government and the COVAX Facility.
 He added the budget will be released once the order made by the government will arrive, including the 1 million Sinovac CoronaVac doses that will come in this month. (PNA)

MANILA – Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo on Wednesday expressed confidence that the “three-pronged strategy” crafted by the country’s economic team would generate more job opportunities in the country.
“Para mapabilis ‘yung ating pagbabalik sa dati nating malusog na ekonomiya at yung pagbabalik sa mga trabaho, ‘yung ating mga economic managers ay merong sinasabing tatlong istratehiya (To restore our robust economy and create more jobs, our economic managers have three strategies),” Panelo said in his commentary show “Counterpoint”.
About four million adult Filipinos were left jobless in January this year despite the gradual reopening of the Philippine economy amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.
Unemployment worsened to 8.7 percent in January from 5.3 percent in the same month last year, according to the preliminary results of the Philippine Statistics Authority’s labor force survey released on Tuesday.
Panelo said further easing of restrictions amid the pandemic would allow more people to return to work.
“Ang ating bansa ngayon ay dahan-dahang bumabalik na kahit may pandemya sapagkat yung mga nawawalan ng trabaho, dahan-dahan na nagkakaroon, nakukuha muli ang mga trabaho nila (Despite the pandemic, our country is gradually returning to normalcy because those who lost their jobs are now able to return to work),” he said.
To address unemployment, Panelo said the country’s economic managers have come up with strategies to accelerate job creation.
These strategies, he said, are the safe reopening of the economy, the full implementation of the recovery package, and the timely implementation of the Covid-19 vaccine program.
Citing the latest labor force survey data released by the National Economic and Development Authority, Panelo noted that about 1.4 million jobs lost due to the pandemic have been restored.
He added that the unemployment rate decreased from 12.4 percent to 8.8 percent last January.
“‘Yung mga employer natin ay talagang hinahanapan ng paraan upang ma-handle nila ‘yung krisis ng maayos at pati na yung negosyo nila, matulungan ang mga empleyado nila sa kanilang mga trabaho at makaahon (The employers in the country are looking for ways to handle the crisis and save their businesses, as well as help their employees recover),” Panelo said.
He also cited the Salary Budget Planning Report of global advisory, broking, and solutions firm Willis Towers Watson, which revealed that workers in the Philippines are projected to have an average increase of 5.6 percent in their salary this year.
“Kahit may pandemya (Even if there’s a pandemic), there will always be a light at the end of the tunnel,” Panelo said. “So when you’re down, there’s no other way but up.” (PNA)

MANILA – Health experts on Wednesday clarified that getting a vaccine passport after having been inoculated is not a guarantee that an individual will not spread or get infected with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) anymore.
In a Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday, Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, a member of the Department of Health’s (DOH) Technical Advisory Group, said vaccine passports will merely serve as a record that an individual has been vaccinated.
“Hindi 'yung kapag nakapagbigay proof ka na nabakunahan ka na eh hindi ka na manghahawa at hindi ka (na) mahahawaan. And in fact, wala pa tayo ganun klaseng information (It won’t be because you already have proof that you’re vaccinated that you cannot infect or get infected. In fact, we don’t have that kind of information yet),” Lim said.
She noted that vaccinated individuals are expected to benefit from a decrease in the severity of Covid-19 symptoms and that there is no information yet on whether vaccination will decrease transmission of the disease.
“Kahit na nabakunahan na, ang mga healthcare workers pinag-iingat pa rin ang lahat kasi yun ngang paglipat ng sakit, whether mahawaan or manghawa, ay hindi kasama dun sa datos na hawak natin sa ngayon (Even after inoculation, our health workers are still being cautioned because the transmission of the disease is not included in the data that we have right now),” Lim said.
Dr. John Wong, a member of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infections Diseases–Technical Working Group on Data Analytics, said vaccine passports will be required mostly by businesses such as airline companies before allowing people inside their establishments.
However, he said, “it will take a while before the Philippines reaches that stage, where we'll be able to say somebody with a vaccination passport will not be able to transmit, that it will be safe.” 
The spread of new variants
Meanwhile, Wong said the Philippine Genome Center has detected “several cases” of both the UK and South Africa variant of the virus that causes Covid-19, noting that the UK-variant was known to have increased transmissibility while the South Africa-variant is supposed to be resistant against vaccines.
He said the current surge of new cases of Covid-19 in the country may be caused by the UK-variant.
If over half of all cases in the National Capital Region (NCR) gets infected with the UK-variant, he said there may be an increase of “nine times more cases after a month.”
“So, we have to take precautions to avoid this,” Wong said.
On Tuesday, the DOH reported 2,668 new infections of Covid-19, with active cases totaling 41,822 or 7 percent of all infections since the pandemic hit the country back in 2020. (PNA)

MANILA – More and more health workers are getting vaccinated with the CoronaVac and AstraZeneca vaccines, with a health expert noting that the availability of the second brand of a vaccine for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) has encouraged more vaccinations.
In a Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday, Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, a member of the Department of Health’s (DOH) Technical Advisory Group, said the vaccination drive among health workers have so far received a good response, noting that those apprehensive about CoronaVac’s “low” efficacy for preventing mild symptoms have been encouraged with the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines.
“Dahil nagkaroon na ng ibang options, mas marami din nagkaroon ng encouragement na magpabakuna (Because of the addition of another option, more have been encouraged to get vaccinated),” Lim said.
However, she emphasized the importance of receiving any of the vaccines if they fit the criteria for inoculation.
“As long as nagpi-fit tayo sa criteria kung saan siya dapat gamitin magpabakuna na tayo kasi dagdag proteksyon talaga ‘to (As long as we fit the criteria on how it must be used then we should get vaccinated because this is increased protection),” Lim said.
Following reports of a decrease in efficacy of vaccines for other variants of the virus that causes the Covid-19, she said less protection is still better than having no protection at all.
“Kahit anong bakuna pa ang matanggap mo, kahit sabihin pa natin na medyo bumaba ang bisa niyan, meron pa rin kesa sa zero kung hindi ka nagpabakuna (Whatever vaccine you receive, even if it’s found that its efficacy lessened, it is still better than no protection at all if you don’t get inoculated),” Lim said.
Getting vaccinated, she said, is expected to decrease the severity of Covid-19 infections, noting that there is no information yet on whether vaccinations decrease transmission of the disease.
“Kahit na nabakunahan na, ang mga healthcare workers pinag-iingat pa rin ang lahat kasi yun ngang paglipat ng sakit, whether mahawaan or manghawa, ay hindi kasama dun sa datos na hawak natin sa ngayon (Even after inoculation, our health workers are still being cautioned because the transmission of the disease is not included in the data that we have right now),” Lim said.

MANILA – The government aims to start the vaccination of the general public as soon as the inoculation program for healthcare workers and senior citizens will be finished by the middle of this year, a National Task Force Against Covid-19 (NTF) official said.
 During the Laging Handa briefing Wednesday, NTF deputy chief implementer Vivencio Dizon said the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) immunization program for the general public will be done in time for the arrival of more vaccines that the government ordered from various vaccine makers.
 “Our objective is by mid-year we’re done inoculating our health care workers and senior citizens. That’s in time with the arrival of Moderna and other vaccines, then we can start the vaccination for the general public,” Dizon said in Filipino.
 He added that next to healthcare workers and senior citizens, the priority sectors for the Covid-19 vaccines are those with comorbidities, non-medical front-liners like police, economic front-liners including public transportation drivers and wet market vendors, and indigent population.
 To date, the Philippines received a total of 1,125,600 doses of Covid-19 vaccines -- 600,000 Sinovac’s CoronaVac were donated by the Chinese government and 525,600 AstraZeneca vaccines were from the COVAX Facility that arrived in two batches.
 “Of the 1.1 million doses that arrived, more than half or around 60 percent were distributed and deployed,” Dizon said adding the remaining vials are continuously being given to healthcare workers across the country.
 Dizon said they are hopeful to receive more than 2 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines this month.
 Of the expected 2 million doses that will arrive this month, 1.4 million vials are from Sinovac -- 400,000 are the additional donation from China and 1 million doses are ordered by the Philippine government.
 “The World Health Organization committed that the next tranches of AstraZeneca from COVAX Facility are going to arrive. So we hope to receive more than the 1.4 million Sinovac this March. Hopefully, we will reach more than 2 million this March,” Dizon said in Filipino.
 Moreover, Dizon said the NTF will look into doing two to three shifts a day for vaccine administrators once the inoculation program for the general public will start to fast-track the rollout of Covid-19 immunization program.
 He added the government will be able to reach its target of inoculating 50 million Filipinos by the end of 2021 as long as the significant amount of vaccine supply will arrive within the year. (PNA)

 Lim said a simulation activity would be held Wednesday in preparation for the start of inoculation of more than 1,000 health care workers.
 “The good thing with Sinovac, it is not that sensitive. With regards to storage, it only requires 2 (degrees) to 8 degrees, which is a normal refrigerator temperature, plus new reports are coming out that it is also effective against new variants,” he said.
 The Department of Health - Center for Health and Development (DOH-CHD) 1 (Ilocos region) turned over on Tuesday some 2,171 doses of the Sinovac vaccine, CoronaVac. 
 “We thank Dr. Valeriano Lopez, DOH-CHD-1 director, (Health) Secretary (Francisco) Duque, and the Inter-Agency Task Force representatives for helping us. We are thankful as Dagupan is one of the priority areas since we have a lot of hospitals in the city. This is part of the donation from China.

Dr. Rochelle Oco, acting head of the City Health Office, said the local government has sent letters of intent to at least two foreign drug companies for the purchase of their approved vaccines for the disease.
She said these efforts are being facilitated by the League of Cities of the Philippines, in which City Mayor Ronnel Rivera sits as the national vice-chairperson. The mayor is a member of the group’s committee on vaccine availment.
Oco said the city specifically ordered 160,000 shots each for the first dose and the same number for the second dose from British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and the American Novavax Inc.
The Food and Drug Administration has already issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the AstraZeneca vaccine and is working on issuing the same for Novavax, which is manufactured by the Serum Institute of India.
“This will cover roughly 300,000 eligible residents,” she said in the question hour during the city council’s regular session on Tuesday.
Rivera earlier announced that the local government has allocated around PHP200 million for the purchase of the vaccines and their rollout.
Oco said the vaccines alone will cost around PHP125 million based on the projection of the City Budget Office.
She said that based on the current global trend on the availability of the Covid-19 vaccines, the delivery could start by the third quarter of the year.
The official said the vaccines that will be purchased by the city will augment the supplies that would be allotted by the national government, which has yet to release the specific figures.
She said they expect that the combined vaccine supplies would be enough to cover at least 70 percent of the city’s over 700,000 population to achieve herd immunity against Covid-19.
Citing the Department of Health guidelines, she said the priority for the vaccination rollout will be the health care workers, senior citizens, indigent residents as well as military, police, and other security and law enforcement personnel who are aged 18 to 65-years-old.
The vaccination of the priority health care workers in the city started last Monday (March 8), using the Sinovac vaccines donated by the Chinese government.
A total of 3,138 medical professionals and staff members of six referral hospitals here for Covid-19 patients are eligible to get the vaccines until the end of the inoculation period on March 14. (PNA)

“Bigyan po natin ng tiwala ang bakuna at ang pamahalaan po natin na ginagawa ang lahat para bigyan tayo ng panlaban sa sakit (Let us trust the vaccines and our government that is doing all efforts to give us resistance to disease),” Santiago said in a statement on Tuesday.

Chichioco was the first healthcare worker in the province to be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine.
He said there will be 3,247 additional vaccines that will arrive in the province within this week. On March 6, a total of 846 vials of Sinovac vaccines were delivered to the JBLMGH.
“It not less than 4,000 po yung naka-allocate sa atin (were allocated to us). So, we hope to inoculate at least 30 percent of healthcare workers in the entire province depending sa allocation,” he said.

ILOILO CITY – To open Boracay Island including to international tourists, the industry players on the island need to be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
In a press conference Tuesday, Aklan Governor Florencio Miraflores said he requested last month for 40,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines from the national Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the economic sector, which is the tourism sector.
He made the advance request, as the tourism sector, just like other leading industries, significantly contributes to the national economy.
Miraflores said the tourism sector has a huge contribution to the country’s gross domestic product, (GDP) amounting to PHP56 billion as of last count.
“To revive the economy, it is very important that the tourism sector should also be revived,” he said in a press conference streamed at the Facebook page of the Kalibo Cable TV Network Inc.
However, the provision of vaccines prioritizes the health sector and the elderly. Once they are done, then the distribution will go by sectors already, he added.
“But we are hoping that the 40,000 doses that we requested for Boracay will be prioritized also by the national government,” he said.
The governor expressed confidence that the government will prioritize Boracay once the tourism sector is already on the list of recipients.
“Once they get vaccinated in Boracay, we will open up Boracay to the world, not only to domestic tourists but to the rest of the world,” he said.
On Tuesday, the province of Aklan received its 2,420 vials of the Sinovac vaccine from the Department of Health Western Visayas Center for Health Development (DOH WV CHD).
Bulk of the vaccines will go to the Dr. Rafael S. Tumbukon Memorial Hospital (DRSTMH) with 920 vials.
Dr. Myla Bernabe, who represented the DOH WV CHD, said the vaccines already covered health workers from the province’s district, municipal and private hospitals. They are also assured of their second dose sometime next month, or after 28 days.
“We are assured that all our hospital health workers will be protected by the vaccine. As mentioned, AstraZeneca is also coming but is limited to the senior citizen health workers,” he said.
He added that according to experts, the Sinovac vaccine is 50 percent effective for mild cases, 57 percent for moderate cases, and 100 percent for severe cases that could lead to death.
The rollout on March 10 will be covered by cable stations in Kalibo for the public to witness and boost their confidence in the Sinovac vaccine, he said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

BACOLOD CITY – Residents of this city are enjoined anew to register for vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) as medical front-liners who took the initial shots of Sinovac’s CoronaVac have been doing well days after they were vaccinated.
Dr. Edwin Miraflor, officer-in-charge of the City Health Office, said on Tuesday that since life is at stake, the best vaccine is the one readily available.
“We have already seen our medical practitioners avail of the Sinovac vaccine and so far, since March 5, we have not received any adverse reaction,” Miraflor told the Philippine News Agency.
He pointed out that “without prejudice to any race or nationality, Sinovac is one of the top vaccine manufacturers in China”, utilizing the traditional method of vaccine preparation.
“It is not like the replica gadgets and other peripherals sold wherever that we fear may be compromised. Sinovac’s CoronaVac has undergone clinical trials and in fact, has been used in other Asian countries,” he added.
On March 5, Miraflor administered the first shot here of CoronaVac on Dr. Miguel Sarabia, president of the Negros Occidental Medical Society, in a ceremonial vaccination held at the Bacolod Government Center, a couple of hours after the Sinovac vaccines arrived in the city.
Two Covid-19 referral hospitals here, including the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH) and the Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (DPOTMH), held a ceremonial vaccination in separate rites held on Monday.
“We hope this message resonates down to the community that more of you will now agree to get vaccinated. More than this, I hope that our people will greatly realize that the development and approval of safe and effective vaccine less than a year after the emergence of a new virus is a stunning scientific achievement and a much-needed source of hope,” Miraflor, who represented Mayor Evelio Leonardia at the DPOTMH event, said.
Dr. Jose Pepito Malapitan, acting assistant medical director of DPOTMH, said it is best that medical front-liners can show that they are willing to get vaccinated themselves to give the people courage to also avail themselves of the vaccine.
“Right now, I feel nothing, but we have to be observed and we have to report anything that we might feel for 24 hours. So far even in studies, there are only a few who had any reaction,” Malapitan said after taking the first shot.
In Bacolod, residents willing to be vaccinated can register online through tinyurl.com/bcdceironline and tinyurl.com/bcdceirbrgy.
As of March 8, Bacolod has no new case and death. Of the 5,847 confirmed cases in the city, 5,589 have recovered. There are still 70 active cases and 188 deaths. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – Further reopening of the domestic economy and easing of movement restrictions are seen to help address the country’s unemployment rate, which stood at 8.7 percent in January 2021. 
 Economists expect the unemployment rate to remain around this level until next year given the impact of the pandemic on businesses and the job market. 
 In a report, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said the latest unemployment figure “still reflects the relatively slower pace of economic recovery despite the Christmas season that just passed, as Metro Manila remained under GCQ (general community quarantine) since June 2020.” 
 “Thus, further reopening of the economy would provide a structural and more sustainable solution in terms of increased production, sales, incomes/livelihood that also create/entail more employment/jobs and more working hours,” he said. 
 Ricafort said the proposed shift to modified GCQ (MGCQ) alongside the easing of travel restrictions and those being implemented for public transportation “would help create more employment/jobs and help further lower unemployment and underemployment.”
 An additional plus to this factor is the higher government spending on infrastructure and the election-related spending for next year’s national polls.
 He added, “the proposed MGCQ nationwide and any other additional measures to reopen the economy would be a function of additional Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine arrivals and rollouts as well as any reduction in new Covid-19 local cases.”
 ING Bank Manila senior economist Nicholas Mapa said the pandemic and its resulting economic scarring is now taking root as shown by the unemployment rate. 
 He said despite the easing of movement restrictions, “the labor market remains just as challenged with the latest unemployment rate.”
 “This translates to four million Filipinos without a job which will likely complicate the expected pickup in consumer spending should the government’s wish to move to MGCQ be granted,” he added.
 Mapa said the rise of unemployment and underemployment, which rose to 16 percent last January from 14.4 percent in the last quarter of 2020, “point to subdued access to income and likely muted purchasing power, now all the more problematic given the rise in inflation.”
 “The high level of unemployment will be around even if we relax quarantine measures as the scarring effects of closed businesses and jobs lost become more entrenched and the economy slowly spirals into lower levels of GDP (gross domestic product),” he added. (PNA)

CEBU CITY – Inoculation against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) of medical front-liners in the private sector in Cebu has started on Tuesday.
A total of 9,000 health workers from eight private hospitals in the province are lined up for the vaccination rollout, as the Department of Health (DOH) expanded the inoculation drive to non-government centers.
DOH-7 chief pathologist Dr. Mary Jean Loreche said the healthcare workers (HCWs) from level 1 and 2 non-government hospitals are likewise scheduled for inoculation using the CoronaVac jabs from China’s Sinovac Biotech company.
Loreche said 2,468 doses of CoronaVac vaccines have been allocated to Chong Hua Hospital-Fuente; 1,585 doses for Cebu Doctors’ University Hospital; 1,200 for Perpetual Succor Hospital; 1,111 doses for Chong Hua Hospital-Mandaue; 414 doses for Cebu South General Hospital; 364 doses for Cebu North General Hospital; and 560 doses for Mactan Doctor’s Hospital.
These hospitals simultaneously administered Tuesday the China-made vaccines to their medical workers.
Loreche said the University of Cebu Medical Center (UCMed) has an allocation of 1,230 doses. However, the DOH Sinovac jabs are yet to be delivered pending inspection of their cold chain facility.
Perpetual Succor Hospital vaccination point-person, Dr. Elrey Inocian, told the media that they targeted to inoculate 600 of the 1,107 HCWs in this private hospital run by a Roman Catholic congregation of the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres.
With 120 vaccinees per day, Inocian said they expect to finish the inoculation in five days. 
“Most of them who come today for vaccination are off from their duty. We give them the freedom to choose a day in time that they do not have work so that they can rest after the inoculation,” Inocian said in Cebuano.
The hospital established a hotline for adverse reactions from the vaccine, he said, adding that each vaccinee has been given a three-hour observation period after the inoculation to monitor any adverse reactions.
Inocian said the vaccinees would get the second dose within 28 days “in order to reach the efficacy rate of 98 percent” of the CoronaVac jabs.
Aside from Perpetual Succor Hospital, other hospitals that simultaneously administered CoronaVac to their medical employees are the Cebu Doctors’ Hospital Group and Chong Hua Hospital.
Cebu Doctors’ Hospital Group owner, Dr. Potenciano Larrazabal III, was among the hundreds of front-liners who took the CoronaVac jabs on Tuesday.
Larrazabal, a well-known eye specialist, said getting any available vaccine would help the population to achieve immunity against coronavirus disease.
“The pandemic is getting closer and closer to us. I believe it is just a matter of days that our loved ones or staff may get infected. So vaccination is the way to go if we want to attain herd immunity. That is why I advise our family - the CebuDoc Group to please join this activity. I believe the best vaccine is the first vaccine on hand, and I am here to prove that as I receive the first vaccine today,” Larrazabal said in a statement posted on social media.
He said the mass vaccination in Cebu is “just the start of the end of the long tunnel we have been taking this past year”. (With report from Carlo Lorenciana/PNA)

MANILA – The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) on Tuesday said it is optimistic that employment in the country will continue to improve in the coming months with the availability of vaccines against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
“We expect a better and more improved employment performance in the coming months with the vaccine being made available and more Filipinos under the priority categories getting inoculated,” Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said in a statement.
At the same time, he added that the positive numbers in the country’s labor force show that companies and employees are gaining confidence with the slowly reopening of the economy.
“The results of the January 2021 Labor Force Survey is highly encouraging with a 1.6 million increase in the country’s labor force, and 1.4 million workers who had regained employment,” he added.
Bello also said the improvement in the country's employment situation shows that businesses and workers are starting to regain confidence with the safe reopening of the economy,” he added.
According to Bello, the numbers involved are October 2020 as against the January 2021 figures.
“The improvement in figures being referred to is January 2021 versus October 2020 where there is an increase in the labor force participation rate at 60.5 percent (45.2 million) from 58.7 percent (43.6 million) or an increase of 1.6 million economically active joining the labor force. Meanwhile, employed persons increased by 1.4 million in January 2021 (41.2 million) compared to 39.8 million in October 2020,” he added.
Bello also called on workers and businesses to continue the strict implementation of the minimum public health standards (MPHS), and occupational safety and health policies.
“With the rising number of COVID-19 cases in the past week, we need to instill discipline in adhering to basic MPHS -- the proper wearing of face mask and face shield, washing of hands, social distancing,” he said.
He said the country cannot afford to implement another hard lockdown which would mean losses of jobs and livelihood.
Bello said the Task Group on Economic Recovery (TGER) and the National Employment Recovery Strategy (NERS) Task Force are doubling their efforts to achieve economic rebound and sustained labor market improvement in the new normal.
“The country’s recovery goal is to safely reopen the economy, bring back more workers in their jobs, and preserve and generate more employment for the Filipinos here and abroad,” he added. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

DAGUPAN CITY – Most of the healthcare workers in Region 1 Medical Center (R1MC) here who were vaccinated with the first batch of Sinovac vaccines said they got it to protect themselves, the patients, and their families.
 ""I feel privileged and happy to be one of the recipients of Sinovac vaccine. This is for my family, my patients. Thank you DOH (Department of Health), thank you R1MC,"" said Dr. Agnes Dimaano, a medical specialist from the Department of Pediatrics in R1MC.
 Dimaano was the first to be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine in Pangasinan and in the entire Ilocos Region.
 ""I am so happy being vaccinated. I expose myself daily with Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with my mask and face shield as my only protection. Now with the vaccine, I am more confidently safe caring and treating patients with Covid-19. Humanity wins over viruses,"" said Dr. Rowena Virrey, infectious disease medical specialist.

 ""This also became a family affair since I had it with my sister and brother-in-law. We encourage more healthcare workers to get the vaccine for your family, patients, and other people you mingle with,"" she said. 
 Dr. John Fernandez, a pediatric intensivist, said he chose to be vaccinated as he believed it would help him better protect his family, his critically-ill pediatric patients, his co-workers, and his own health.
 The vaccine acceptability among frontline health workers in the eight referral hospitals in the Ilocos Region, including R1MC, is increasing amid the arrival of doses of vaccines in the region, according to DOH Center for Health and Development Ilocos regional office (DOH-CHD-1) information officer Dr. Rheuel Bobis.
 In an interview on Tuesday, Bobis said that from the 41-percent acceptability prior to the arrival of the vaccines, the percentage of health workers who want to be inoculated is increasing daily.
 “They are excited for the vaccines as this is a big step in getting immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). They are also glad as they now have a new weapon against the virus,” he said.
 On Monday night, some 25,600 doses of both Sinovac and Astrazeneca vaccines arrived at the DOH-CHD-1 office here.
 Bobis said the 10,000 doses of Astrazeneca vaccines will be given to the frontline medical workers aged 60 and above in the eight referral hospitals in the region, while the 14,400 Sinovac vaccines will be distributed to the medical workers both in public and private hospitals in the region catering to Covid-19 patients.
 “We will prioritize with Astrazeneca vaccines the senior citizen medical workers who have direct exposure to Covid-19 patients in the eight referral hospitals since Sinovac is prohibited to senior citizens. The new batch of Sinovac vaccines will be distributed today to the Provincial Health Office of La Union and Lorma Medical Center and other private and district hospitals in La Union, Ilocos Norte, and Dagupan City and tomorrow at Ilocos Sur and Pangasinan,” he added.
 The 1,200 doses, Bobis said, are allocated for the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Naval Forces Northern Luzon.
 “It is part of the 100,000 Sinovac vaccine allocation of the Department of National Defense,” he said.
 Bobis also attributed the increasing vaccine acceptability among medical front-liners in the eight referral hospitals to the effects of the vaccine to the first batch of workers inoculated.
 Out of the over 2,000 frontline health workers inoculated with Sinovac vaccine as of Monday, only seven of them experienced minor side effects that are common and not life-threatening, he said.
 “On the fourth day of our vaccination with Sinovac among health workers in the eight coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) referral hospitals in the region, seven health workers experienced respectively, the heaviness of the arm, redness and or irritation in the area vaccinated, and one with fever,” he added.

(PNA photo by Richelyn Gubalani) 
GENERAL SANTOS CITY – Two elderly practicing doctors have availed of the Sinovac vaccines in the first two days of inoculation for priority frontline health care workers here, an official said on Tuesday.
Dr. Ryan Aplicador, deputy incident commander of the City Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, said Dr. Wilfredo Garcia, 70, and Dr. Benjamin Pagarigan Jr., 69, were vaccinated with their first doses on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
He said the two, who are still serving at the local government-run Dr. Jorge P. Royeca Hospital (DJPRH), volunteered to get the CoronaVac, the vaccine’s trade name, despite being properly informed that it was not recommended for them due to lack of clinical trials.
The Department of Health (DOH) only recommended the vaccine to individuals aged 18 to 59 years old based on its “higher efficacy” rate.
But, Aplicador said the two doctors signed waivers that they want to receive the CoronaVac vaccine and submitted clearances from their personal doctors.
Aside from them, he said several health workers who have diabetes and hypertension were vaccinated after passing the mandatory screening.
“As of now, they are all in good condition and did not experience any adverse side effects,” Aplicador told reporters.
Pagarigan, a former chief of the DJPRH, said he has full confidence that the CoronaVac will give him enough protection against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
“At my age, I can’t risk that. I’ll do this anytime even without a waiver,” he told PNA before getting the vaccine.
He is hoping that their decision would inspire and encourage other health workers to get vaccinated early against the disease.
On the first day of inoculation, some 84 of DJPRH’s 549 active personnel were given the CoronaVac vaccine.
Aplicador said that from the initial 40 percent who signified and gave their consent to be vaccinated before the rollout, the number has so far increased to about 50 percent.
“We’re expecting that more will come forward until the (March 14) deadline,” he said.
DOH-12 delivered last Saturday a total of 3,138 vials of the CoronaVac vaccine for the first dose of priority health care workers from six Covid-19 referral hospitals in the city.
These are the DJPRH, St. Elizabeth Hospital Inc.(SEHI), General Santos Doctor’s Hospital, Socsargen County Hospital (SCH), Mindanao Medical Center, and GenSan Medical Center.
Partial data showed that 100 workers of SEHI and 61 from SCH received the vaccines on Monday.
Citing the DOH’s guidelines, Aplicador said the unused vials will be returned to the agency’s main hub in Cotabato City after the end of the seven-day vaccination period.
He added that the second dose or booster shots of the recipients will be administered on April 5. (PNA)

At the CLMMRH, only about 50 percent of the 1,743 hospital staff has consented to avail of Sinovac shots for varying reasons – some are already above 60 years old, some have existing medical conditions, and some are hesitant because of the brand, Frayco said.
“I hope that in the next few days after they will see that I’m okay, that I didn’t experience major side effects, it will encourage healthcare workers to take part in the vaccination program. We should be grateful for what we have now if we want to be protected,” she said.
Dr. Joan Cerrada, planning chief of the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System Covid-19 Response Team, said that having access to the vaccine is a privilege for everyone since it is given for free.
“We don’t have to pay for it, grab the opportunity. We need to develop herd immunity and we can only do that if many of our population is vaccinated. They say, 60 to 70 percent. Let’s help each other, let’s help end this pandemic. Get vaccinated,” she added.
Cerrada, a Gawad Bayaning Kalusugan awardee in the health care and case management of Covid-19 patients in Philippine hospitals, stressed the need for vaccination to have more protection against the deadly virus.
“I need to have myself protected, my family and my patients, and I’m proud of that,” she said.
She urged her fellow healthcare workers to take the vaccine and contribute to the measures that the government and the global community are doing to put an end to the health crisis.
“I have studied all the measures that we need to do to end this pandemic. We have had everything. Social distancing, face shield, face mask, everything but it’s still there. The one that is missing is the vaccination, and that’s what we need to do to have layers of protection against the virus,” she added. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

ILOILO CITY – A journey towards “normalcy” has started with the availability of the vaccine to fight the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and the people can almost claim that they “are about to see the sunrise”.
This was the message of Dr. Joselito Villaruz, president of the West Visayas State University (WVSU) system, as the West Visayas State University Medical Center (WVSUMC) rolled out its vaccination on Monday.
“The development of the vaccine has been considered as man’s greatest discovery which has saved innumerable lives in the history of mankind. This new development is once again a testament that science research and medicine will be our only weapons to ensure human survival,” he said.
Villaruz joined other medical doctors in calling for the eligible population to get inoculated.
“Each one of us must be inoculated. This is the only way. We cannot wait any longer, for today is one golden opportunity that we wouldn’t want to miss. If we are to survive this generation, we must stand united and strong. Keep the negativities and politics behind. We will do this because we love ourselves, our families, and our community,” he said.
WVSUMC officer-in-charge Dr. Dave Endel Gelito III, in his message, said that they have been gifted with “something more than a mask, PPE (personal protective equipment)”. What was given, he said, was a chance to get protected from the virus and “regain freedom from the shackles of Covid-19”.
“As I receive my first dose of Sinovac, I would like to appeal to more of my fellow healthcare workers to avail of this vaccine. With the recent surges in Manila and Cebu, I believe the earlier we get protection, the better for all of us,” he said.
Apart from the WVSUMC, three other Covid-19 referral hospitals in Iloilo namely Western Visayas Medical Center (WVMC), Iloilo Doctor’s Hospital (IDH) and the Iloilo St. Paul’s Hospital also started their vaccination.
On Friday, 18 boxes or more or less 6,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccines arrived in Iloilo. Hours after the arrival, the Iloilo St. Paul’s Hospital held its ceremonial vaccination in preparation for Monday's rollout.
Onboard to monitor the inoculation were members of the Western Visayas Regional Vaccine Operations Center (RVOC) for Covid-19 chaired by Director Emilia P. Monicimpo of the Department of Health and Civil Defense Western Visayas Director Jose Roberto Nuñez who is in charge of the logistics.
Monicimpo, in her message, urged health workers to “grab the opportunity” because other hospitals are waiting to also have their allocation.
“I hope you can increase the number of recipients so we can also cater to others interested to receive Sinovac. The best vaccine right now is the vaccine that is available,” she said.
As of Monday, the hospital targets to cover 163 of its 687 workers who agreed to be vaccinated. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Duterte on Monday night (March 8, 2021) said Robredo caused doubt when she called for a review of Sinovac's CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine by the Health Technology Assessment Council just as the government was boosting public confidence in the vaccines. (Presidential file photo)
MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night said Vice President Leni Robredo’s call for a review of Sinovac's CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) created doubt just as the government was boosting public confidence in the vaccines.
In a pre-recorded public address, Duterte said Robredo did the public a “disservice” by supposedly making it appear that the government was skipping regulatory processes for vaccines.
He insisted that an HTAC review is only recommendatory and is not required before the government can roll out vaccines.
“Ang ginawa niyang disservice to the people is noong hindi niya sinabi na recommendatory (She did a great disservice to the people when she didn’t say that it was recommendatory),” he said.
Duterte said Robredo did not even bother understanding the provision under the Universal Health Care Act or Republic Act also known as Republic Act No. 11223 which states that the HTAC is recommendatory.
The donated Sinovac shots, he said, are not yet required to undergo an HTAC review because these were donated and not procured by the government.
“We were fighting against the tide of non-believers na huwag kayong matakot, ganito (not to be afraid). Now, here comes the statement na hindi niya --- hindi niya binasa kumpleto ang batas (she made without completely reading the law), with just a simple statement, magke-create ka ng (you’re creating) doubt,” he said.
He blamed Robredo’s call for an HTAC review as the reason why more individuals rejected the Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines.
“We were doing everything convincing, spending most of our time convincing the people that it is safe. Ang bakuna is safe. Now, if you create that uncertainty in the minds of the people mas maraming ayaw (there would be more who would refuse to get vaccinated),” he said.
Duterte expressed frustration over how Robredo relied on “half-truths” when she failed to read the UHC law.
“Medyo galit ako (I’m slightly angry) for coming with a half-truth na basahin mo kalahati lang (where you read just half of the law),” he said.
Instead of joining the government’s efforts to promote vaccine confidence, he said Robredo “muddled up everything.”
“I said, creating an uncertainty and doubt in the minds of the people. So ‘yon ang nagalitan ko (So that’s why I’m angry) because we were running against time, kailangan mabakuna na agad (we needed to start vaccination immediately),” he said.
He, meanwhile, appealed to Robredo to stay quiet if she is unsure of her statements.
“I hope that next time kung wala naman siyang masabi na tama (if she can’t say anything right), she just would maybe shut up. Siguraduhin niya muna o hindi magbasa siya, siya mismo. Ikaw, ma’am, ang magbasa and (Make sure you read first and) take notes of the important or salient points of the law. Otherwise, I said, a misplaced comma could change the meaning of everything,” he said.
Last week, Health Secretary Francisco Duque said the HTAC is evaluating the Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines since the government is expected to procure 1 million doses this month under a PHP700 million purchase deal.

“We should not be reluctant about the vaccine and be prepared for the vaccine, we need to be inoculated so that we can alleviate the loss of dear lives,” said CBCP-ECH vice chairman Bishop Oscar Jaime Florencio.
He said the public should make use of the available vaccine after the government announced that another 1.4 million doses of Sinovac CoronaVac vaccine are set to arrive on March 21.
Aside from the CoronaVac jabs, the country is slated to receive around 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines through the COVAX Facility, to be delivered until May.
On Sunday, Moderna Inc. announced it has signed a supply agreement with the Philippines for 13 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine that will arrive by the third quarter of this year.
“We know that this Covid will stay even without vaccine or with vaccine. They will stay with us for a while. Now, we know that there is already an available vaccine out there, it might not be enough, but it is there already and for us Catholic this may be the answer to our Oratio Imperata. Why not avail for those who are given the slots. Otherwise, our Oratio will be useless,” he said in an interview.
The Philippines received its first batch of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine on Feb. 28 donated by China and 520,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine that arrived in two batches through COVAX Facility on March 4 and 7.
As for those who expressed concerns about the Covid-19 vaccine side effects, Florencio said the faithful are not being forced to have the vaccine.
“Now for those, who would want to argue that this or that vaccine has many side effects, any other vaccines have their side effects. If we are not sure, don’t get the vaccine. But if we know that we are healthy and ready for the vaccine and we’re given a slot, then take it,” he said. “Just like what the experts said the best vaccine is what you have now, because the other vaccines have not been approved and we have not acquired them.”

MANILA – As the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) ramped up the vaccination of its medical front-liners, AFP chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana on Monday urged all military personnel to take part in the government's inoculation program to protect themselves and their families against Covid-19.
Sobejana made this call as the AFP transported some 19,800 doses of the Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccine to different military units nationwide.
""We encourage every member of the AFP, to take part in the government’s vaccination program. This is not only meant to protect yourself from the virus, but also to encourage our families and others, who are still undecided to be inoculated,” Sobejana said.

Aside from the Eastern Mindanao Command in Davao City, Basa Air Base and the Clark Airbase, both in Pampanga, received 1,200 vials of the Covid-19 vaccine each.
Meanwhile, Camp Aquino in Tarlac received 2,400 vials while Fort Magsaysay in Nueva Ecija got 1,200 doses.
Naval Station Agbenar and Wallace Air Station, both located in La Union, 600 vials each while the Philippine Military Academy received 3,000 vaccines on Monday.

CEBU CITY – The Department of Health (DOH) in Central Visayas on Monday said it has not monitored significant adverse event reactions from more than a thousand front-liners at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) who have received the CoronaVac jabs.
DOH-7 chief pathologist, Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, said there were only 42 healthcare workers (HCWs), or 3 percent of the 1,397 vaccinees who reported post-inoculation complaints but not all of these were related to the vaccines. 
The data was taken from the VSMMC’s inoculation center from March 4–7.
“Let me explain it this way, what they feel like light-headedness, headache or pain on the injection site or dizziness may not be caused by the vaccine itself. The vaccine will take time in the body to have the precise reaction. They may be incidental findings,” Loreche said.
Most of the reactions recorded by the DOH-7 are pain in the vaccination arm area.
Other complaints were light-headedness, dizziness, feeling tired, numbness in vaccination site, itching, hypertension, headache and fainting.
Loreche, regional Covid-19 spokesperson, said the vaccinee’s failure to take a meal before inoculation and those who have fear of injection would normally experience issues like dizziness after getting the vaccine jab.
“There are adverse events which we may feel even with other vaccines. It’s not fair to connect those issues to the Sinovac vaccines,” she said in mixed Cebuano and English.
More vaccines for the region
Loreche said they are expecting an initial delivery of 20,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines within the week.
The UK-made vaccines intended for the elderly healthcare workers in the region will be taken from the more than 500,000 doses that arrived in Manila from the COVAX facility.
Loreche said Cebu has so far received a total of 14,680 doses of CoronaVac, the vaccines made by China’s Sinovac Biotech, in two batches. (With report from Carlo Lorenciana/PNA)

MARAWI CITY – Despite her parents being coronavirus disease (Covid-19) skeptics, a 32-year-old nurse at Amai Pakpak Medical Center here decided to be inoculated when the Sinovac jabs were made available among medical front-liners here on Monday.

Norhaisa Aragon, a registered nurse for five years, said she did it to protect her parents, although the latter have repeatedly expressed conspiracy theories about Covid-19 and the vaccines in general.

Aragon, who has been assigned at the triage center since the start of the pandemic last year, said her parents believe Covid-19 is a government-manufactured lie.

Because her job entails assessing and segregating patients if they are suspected as Covid-19 carriers, Aragon said was worried she might contract the virus one day.

""My parents are both diabetic, and they have low immune system. I don't want them to get infected if ever I could get the virus from my workplace. Getting vaccinated will help me,"" Aragon said.

Her parents are not alone in expressing skepticism over the virus.

Some residents, such as Jahari Saber, an ambulant vendor with space outside the Amai Pakpak Medical Center (APMC), said he has not seen anyone sick of the virus in the year since the pandemic broke out.

""For the longest time I have been selling here, I haven't seen anyone who suddenly fell over because they got Covid. What I saw is that they went directly to the hospital because of cough and fever,"" he said in vernacular.

The APMC management started administering Sinovac vaccines to 1,181 employees after receiving the Sinovac vaccines from the Department of Health over the weekend.

Dr. Shalimar Rakiin, APMC chief of hospital, said an overwhelming majority of their staff have expressed interest in receiving the vaccines.

""The workers have the right to refuse. But I am confident that when they see their colleagues being vaccinated, the number of employees willing to receive the jab will increase,"" Rakiin, who was the first to be vaccinated, said.

DOH has given APMC to finish the first dose of vaccination on Thursday, according to Rakiin. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – Malacañang on Monday said the vaccination of frontline healthcare workers is expected to be completed by May.
Citing National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said vaccination of frontline medical workers would take at least three months.
“I’m restating what Secretary Galvez said: Matatapos natin ang health front-liners (Health front-liners will be done) by May and we can begin with the economic front-liners by April,” he said in a Palace press briefing.
As of Sunday, Roque said nearly 30,000 frontline medical workers have been vaccinated against Covid-19.
The government, he said, will need 3.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses for 1.7 million healthcare workers in the country.
“Mayroon na tayong halos 30,000 or 29,266 na medical front-liners na nabakunahan (Almost 30,000 or 29,266 medical front-liners have been vaccinated),” he said.
A total of 383,960 vaccines have been deployed where 329,480 are China’s Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines and 54,500 are United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca vaccines.
Roque also said the first dose deployment of Sinovac vaccines has been completed.
“Iyong first dose deployment po ng Sinovac, tapos na po. Na-deploy na po lahat iyong first dose ng Sinovac (The first dose deployment of Sinovac is finished. All the first doses of Sinovac have been deployed),” he said.
Galvez earlier said another 1 million doses of CoronaVac procured by the government are set to arrive the Philippines on March 21.
He said the Chinese government has also vowed to donate additional 400,000 doses of CoronaVac. China’s first donation of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac arrived in the Philippines on Feb. 28.
The Philippines also received 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine through the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility on March 4. Additional 38,400 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine arrived on March 7.
In light of the arrival of the AstraZeneca vaccines, the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group’s (NITAG) said Sinovac vaccines are not recommended to be administered to healthcare workers aged 60 years old and above.

The KCH was among the Covid-19 treatment facilities accredited by the Department of Health (DOH) -12.

The city has received an allotment of 137 Sinovac vaccines from the DOH for health workers directly handling Covid-19 patients.

“The vaccines were immediately stored at the PHP2-million cold storage facility set up by the city government recently,” Mayor Joseph Evangelista told reporters here Monday.

Also on Monday, the mayor led the opening program for the vaccination rollout and lauded all medical front-liners for their selfless service to the people.

Evangelista has also expressed his willingness to be vaccinated against Covid-19 in due time.

“I am more than willing to receive the vaccine, but these doses were all allocated for you, for your safety. We will just wait for our inoculation time”, Evangelista told the front-liners.

“We were excellent. Na-control po natin ang pagkalat ng sakit lalung-lalo na kung ikukumpara tayo sa mas mayayaman at mga bansa na mas mararami at mas moderno ang mga ospital (We were able to control the spread of the virus especially compared to richer countries with more and more modern hospitals),” he said in a Palace press briefing.

“We were excellent in managing it. Unfortunately, habang wala ang bakuna, talagang maraming mahahawa at mayroon pa ring mamamatay (while there is no vaccine, there would really be many infections and deaths). But we have limited deaths to around 12,000 – ikumpara mo naman iyan sa Estados Unidos ‘no (compare that to the US),” he said.

He pointed out that the government was also quick to impose community quarantines nationwide to curb the spread of the virus.
“We declared ECQ just in time na dahilan na hindi tayo napagaya ngayon sa rest of the world na ngayon lang sila nagla-lockdown (which is the reason why we didn’t end up like the rest of the world that just imposed their lockdowns),” he added.
He also said the government prioritized upgrades in the country’s healthcare system capacity.

MANILA – Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto cautioned his constituents against thinking the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic is over.
In particular, he asked the working population to be extra careful so as not to bring the virus home.
""Aminin natin, nag-relax na tayong lahat (We should admit that we have relaxed too much). Caution fatigue is real. Let's bring our guard back up. Sumunod sa (Observe the) basic health protocols,"" Sotto wrote on his Facebook page Monday.
As of March 6, Pasig still has 304 active Covid-19 cases, mostly in the barangays of Pinagbuhatan (42), Rosario (28), and Bagong Ilog (27).
Sotto said the city cannot afford another enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) status as “too many people will go hungry”.
“Because of its negative effects on our economy, thousands if not millions will be pushed deeper into poverty for years to come. ECQ was meant to flatten the curve while we strengthen our Covid response,"" he added.
Sotto is still waiting for the recommendations of the city health department as to which villages would be placed under granular lockdowns.
The nationwide vaccination rollout, Sotto reminded, should not make the public complacent and minimum health standards must still be followed.
""Vaccine rollout is dependent on the global supply chain and national distribution,"" he said.
Pasig allotted PHP300 million for its Covid-19 vaccination program. It signed a tripartite agreement with the national government and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for 400,000 doses.
""Unang prayoridad po ang (Our priority) are healthcare (front-liners). Our efforts continue,"" he said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

    BACOLOD CITY – The top official of the Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital (CLMMRH) in this city said he sees better days ahead with the rollout of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine for the hospital front-liners.
“We continue to hope. Today is the start as we immunize about half of the workforce. They would be partially protected and we can serve better. We hope for better days to come. We hope with what we’re doing right now, things will be much different,” Dr. Julius Drilon, medical center chief of CLMMRH, said.
The CLMMRH was among the two Covid-19 referral hospitals here that kicked off the local vaccination program with the inoculation of an initial 16 medical and administrative front-liners in separate ceremonies on Monday.
Both the CLMMRH and the Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (DPOTMH), popularly known as the Riverside Medical Center, were the recipients of some 6,270 doses of CoronaVac developed by Sinovac Biotech, which arrived in the city last Friday.  
At the CLMMRH, nine volunteers, including six doctors, a nurse, and two administrative staff, were the first to be vaccinated with the initial dose.
These included Dr. Franklin Delano Tumaneng, operations chief of the Hospital Emergency Incident Command System (HEICS); Dr. Joan Cerrada, planning chief of HCEIS;  Dr. Hary Carial, chair of the Department of Internal Medicine; Dr. Eirene Ayalin, chair of the Department of Family and Community Medicine; Dr. Carina Frayco, infectious disease specialist; Dr. Rhea Tabujara, pulmonologist; Marybeth Marcial, chief nurse; Antonio Manuel Monfort, chief administrative officer; and John Michael Gabriel Zaragoza, HEICS public information officer.
Drilon thanked the Department of Health and the national government for giving CLMMRH the priority in the initial phase of the vaccine rollout.
“This vaccine is better than no vaccine at all,” Drilon said, adding that some 132 hospital staff tested positive for Covid-19 since August last year, but there are no more active cases at this time.
Drilon said that in the next four to five days, the CLMMRH, which has a total workforce of 1,743 aims to vaccinate about 150 personnel a day, which would mean utilizing an estimated 800 doses for the initial jabs, which will be followed by the second shots after 28 days.  
Those who prefer other brands will be included in the next phase of vaccine rollout, he said.
At the DPOTMH, seven vaccinees participated in the ceremonial vaccination held at the FHM Hall.
Those who took the initial shots were Dr. Jose Pepito Malapitan, acting assistant medical director; Dr. Evram Corral, chair of the Department of Internal Medicine; Dr. Therese Angela Cocjin, infectious diseases consultant;  Dr. Jeanette Umali, head of  Antimicrobial Stewardship Committee;  Ma.

MANILA – There is no need to revert to a stricter community quarantine classification in Metro Manila despite surge in Covid-19 cases, Malacañang said Monday.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said a stricter quarantine status is not yet necessary since the country’s current healthcare capacity is able to handle the rise in Covid-19 cases.
“For the month of March, I don’t think it is called for. Bakit po? Kasi talagang datos po ang ating pinagbabasehan (Why? Because data is our basis),” he said in a Palace press briefing.
Citing data from the health department, Roque said 60 percent of 1,900 intensive care unit (ICU) beds are still available while 65 percent of 13,500 isolation beds remain unoccupied and 75 percent of 6,000 ward beds are also still vacant.
Roque emphasized the need for local government units (LGUs) to step up on their efforts to test, trace, and treat.
“Inaatasan na po natin ang lahat kasama na po ang ating mga lokal na pamahalaan na hindi lang paigtingin ang ating minimum health standards, ipatupad na po natin iyong ating institutional isolation ng mga nagkakasakit. Kinakailangan paigtingin na natin iyong ating tracing at kinakailangan i-isolate din natin iyong mga tao na nagkaroon na ng close contact at bigyan ng [polymerase chain reaction] test iyong mga taong nagkaroon na ng close contact (We direct the local governments not just to enhance the implementation of minimum health standards, but also implement institutional isolation of those infected. We need to enhance tracing and isolation of those with close contact and give PCR tests to those who have had close contract),” he said.
He said LGUs also have the power to impose localized or granular lockdowns in areas with a surge in Covid-19 cases.
“Iyong kalye, iyong bahay, iyong compound na mayroong mga maraming sakit, i-lockdown ninyo na po iyan dahil iyan po talaga ang ating istratehiya ngayon (Implement a lockdown in the street, house, compound with high cases because that’s really the strategy now),” he added.
Roque said the Philippine economy could not afford to revert to a stricter community status as many were going hunger and between jobs.
Former Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit, for his part, attributed the surge in Covid-19 cases to a drop in compliance with minimum health and safety standards.
""Ang tingin ko (I think) the surge is actually due to a drop in compliance, which we can fix, and also an increase in mobility. Diyan natin kailangan ibalanse (That’s what we need to balance) because we want to open the economy,” he said.
Roque appealed to the public not to get tired observing minimum health standards such as wearing of face masks and face shields, frequent hand-washing, and physical distancing.
“Aking pakiusap, huwag po kayong mapagod kasi ngayon ay nandito na ang bakuna, narito na iyong simula ng katapusan ng ating problema (Our appeal is, don’t get tired because the vaccine is here, this is the beginning of the end of our problem),” he said.
Roque, meanwhile, urged frontline medical workers to get vaccinated against Covid-19.
As of Monday, health authorities recorded 3,356 additional Covid-19 cases bringing the total number of cases in the country to 597,763. This is the fourth consecutive day that more than Covid-19 cases breached the 3,000 mark.
Recoveries reached 545,912 after six more people got well and five more deaths brought the death toll to 12,521.
The OCTA Research group on Sunday warned that the Philippines may see 6,000 new Covid-19 cases daily by March 31 if the surge is not managed.
Metro Manila, Apayao, Baguio City, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Batangas, Tacloban City, Iligan City, Davao City, and Lanao del Sur have been placed under the stricter general community quarantine (GCQ) until March 31. The rest of the country is already under most relaxed modified GCQ. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

BALANGA CITY, Bataan – The government targets to inoculate about half of the country's total population against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) this year, Secretary Vivencio Dizon, deputy chief implementer of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, said on Monday.
Dizon came here to witness the first inoculation with Sinovac vaccines of top officials of the Bataan General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC) led by its director, Dr. Ria Baltazar.
“Mga 50 million people ang target natin this year na mabakunahan (Our target is around 50 million people to be vaccinated this year),” he said in his speech, as he noted the rise in Covid-19 cases in some parts of the country and what government is doing to curb further spread of the virus.
“Tuluy-tuloy lang ang ating mga interventions, preventions, pagte-testing, tracing, isolation at pagti-treat pero kasabay niyan ngayon mayroon tayong dagdag na proteksyon, yong pagbabakuna natin (Our interventions, preventions, testing, tracing, isolation and treatment are continuous but, at the same time, we now have extra protection, our vaccinations,” Dizon said.
Cases of other variants of the virus are rising in Metro Manila so there is a need to strengthen the intervention, he noted.
He reminded the public to continue observing the minimum health standards such as the washing of hands, wearing of face masks and physical distancing.
“Kailangan mas mabilis ma-roll out ang mga bakuna natin lalo na sa mga health care workers para kapag naospital ang mga positive sa Covid-19 ay protektado sila (We need to roll out our vaccines faster, especially for health care workers so that when those who tested positive for Covid-19 are hospitalized, they are protected),” Dizon added.
He could not give the exact number of those already vaccinated, saying the Department of Health (DOH) will provide the update.
Dizon also said more vaccines against Covid-19 will be arriving in the country in the next few weeks and months.
He said that as more vaccines arrive, Bataan should be given priority in inoculation, being a major industrial and marine travel site “para masiguro na tuluy-tuloy ang pag-andar ng ekonomiya (to ensure the continuous operation of our economy).”
Dizon also gave tribute to health care workers, adding that the supply of AstraZeneca vaccines should be reserved for the elderly in the sector.
“Kayo ang frontliner, kayo ang ating mga bayani at nararapat lamang na kayo ang unang-unang tatanggap ng bakuna kaya maraming-maraming salamat sa inyong sakripisyo at ito ay galing sa ating mahal ng Pangulo na lahat nang dumating regardless sa kung anong brand yan, lahat ng unang darating na bakuna sa Pilipinas ay para sa inyo (You are the front-liners, you are our heroes and you deserve to be the first to receive the vaccine. So, thank you very much for your sacrifices and these came from our dear President regardless of what brand it is. All the vaccines that are first to arrive are all for you),” he said.
Dizon asked DOH-Region 3 (Central Luzon) director Cesar Cassion to reserve the AstraZeneca vaccines for health workers in Bataan.
He also described the present mood of health workers amid the start of vaccination as different from last year’s when the deadly virus started to adversely affect the country.
“Ngayong araw na ito ay iba na ang nakikita sa mga health workers. Nakangiti na sila at kitang-kita na imbes mukha ng takot ay mukha na ng pag-asa ang makikita sa mga mukha nila. Kaya napakalaki ng simbolo na sila ang unang-unang babakunahan ng mga unang bakuna na dumating nitong nakaraang mga araw (Today, what we are seeing is different with the health workers. They are already smiling and it is obvious that instead of a face of fear, a face of hope could be seen. So, it is a huge symbol that they are the first to be inoculated with the vaccines that came out in recent days,” Dizon said.
He noted that he was inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine, which had no adverse effect on him. He said the vaccine from China is safe and urged everyone to take it.
Dizon, together with Bataan Governor Albert Garcia, Rep. Jose Enrique Garcia III and Mayors Francis Garcia of Balanga City and Gila Garcia of Dinalupihan also inspected the Bataan People’s Center that will serve as the province's mass vaccination center. (PNA)

MANILA – House Speaker Lord Allan Velasco on Monday urged Filipinos to be more vigilant amid the uptick in cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across Metro Manila.
In a statement, Velasco said Filipinos must continue to follow public health protocols until the country has been broadly immunized to prevent further transmission of Covid-19.
“While we understand that more businesses are reopening and people want to resume normal activities, we have to maintain our health protocols until the Covid-19 threat is effectively addressed by our vaccination program,” Velasco said.
Velasco cited OCTA Research projection that the country may post up to 6,000 new Covid-19 cases per day by the end of March.
He said the additional cases in the country reached over 3,000 for three straight days since Friday.
The arrival of the vaccine in the country and its rollout should not be a reason to “let our guard down,” he added.
“We have to wait until such time a greater number of Filipinos are vaccinated and herd immunity has been achieved,” he said.
He said the recently-signed Covid-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 would put the country in a better position to defeat the virus and protect the health of its 110 million people.
The law expedites the purchase and administration of Covid-19 vaccines and sets up an indemnity fund to compensate individuals who will experience adverse effects after vaccination.
“This landmark legislation was designed to fast-track the procurement and administration of the life-saving vaccine against the deadly coronavirus to a greater number of Filipinos,” he said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – At least 5,293 medical front-liners of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) have been inoculated so far with the Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccines as many have responded to the call, AFP public affairs office chief Navy Capt. Jonathan Zata said on Monday.
Zata said the vaccinees came mostly from military treatment facilities (MTFs) in the National Capital Region (NCR) and the 4th Infantry Division in Cagayan De Oro.
""Mainly from the MTFs of the NCR and 4th Infantry Division. Other MTFs (from the Unified Command) will be starting today (Monday),"" he said.
Vaccination of military health front-liners started on March 1, a day after the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine donated by China arrived in the country.
The exact number of vaccinees per MTF is still being collated as of this time, Zata said.
MTFs located in Metro Manila include the Victoriano Luna Medical Center and the Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo Station Hospital, both in Quezon City; Manila Naval Hospital and the Philippine Army General Hospital, both in Taguig and the Philippine Air Force General Hospital in Pasay City.
On Sunday, Philippine Air Force (PAF) spokesperson Lt. Col. Maynard P. Mariano said the air force is committed to transporting the Covid-19 vaccines in different parts of the country.
“Rest assured, the PAF will be relentless in transporting vaccines as the government's workhorse and is one with the nation in the fight against Covid-19,"" he said.
The PAF delivered 5,260 vials of Sinovac Covid-19 vaccines to Puerto Princesa City, Palawan on March 5 via a C-295 medium transport aircraft.
""Upon its arrival at Antonio Bautista Air Base, the vaccines were turned-over by Presidential Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to Palawan Governor Jose Chaves Alvarez and subsequently to DOH (Department of Health) Palawan Representative Dr. Peter Cumareng,"" Mariano said.
He said the vaccines will be administered to the medical health front-liners of various hospitals in Palawan.
Police health front-liners
Meanwhile, all police health front-liners in Metro Manila have been vaccinated with CoronaVac vaccines, Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Debold Sinas said Monday.
In a media interview, Sinas said the PNP received 1,400 for its police health workers in NCR.
He said the medical front-liners are from the PNP headquarters in Camp Crame, Quezon, and the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) in Camp Bagong Diwa, Taguig.
He said they are still waiting for the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Diseases’ (IATF-EID) guidance if the PNP will also be given allocation from the 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines that arrived in two batches through the COVAX Facility on March 4 and 7.

GENERAL SANTOS CITY – More frontline health care workers in South Cotabato province have signified to get inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine as its rollout went on full swing in the area on Monday.
Dr. Conrado Braña, chief of the South Cotabato Provincial Hospital (SCPH), said they received numerous requests among identified priority health workers for inclusion in the list of recipients in the week-long vaccination drive.
Earlier, he said only 291 of the facility’s over 500 personnel initially agreed to receive the vaccines as some opted to wait for its rollout first.
But, he said such number has so far increased and they expect that more will signify to be inoculated before the end of the vaccination period on March 14.
“We’re getting positive feedback among our workers and they are excited to get the vaccines,” he told the Philippine News Agency.
SCPH, which is based in Koronadal City, received last Saturday from the Department of Health-Region 12 a total of 667 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China out of the 1,838 allotted for the five referral hospitals for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients in the province.
Some 358 doses were delivered to Dr. Arturo P. Pingoy Medical Center and 335 to Allah Valley Medical Specialists Center in Koronadal City; 282 to Howard Hubbard Memorial Hospital in Polomolok town; and 196 to Soccsksargen General Hospital in Surallah.
The vaccination of SCPH workers formally started past 9 a.m. Monday, with medical officer Dr. Bryan Non getting the first shot.
Non, who is an advocate of Covid-19 vaccines, said he is hoping that more of his fellow frontline health care workers will be convinced to also get inoculated against the disease.
He said he carefully studied the Sinovac vaccine based on the results of the clinical trials and it is guaranteed to be safe, with lesser chances for recipients to get allergic reactions.
“It is 100 percent effective in preventing severe cases of Covid-19. So if a vaccine can achieve that and prevent death, then it is effective,” he told reporters.
He urged residents to trust the available vaccines distributed to other countries, including those being provided by the national government, and should get inoculated if they are eligible.
Hannah Ebeo, health education and promotion officer of the South Cotabato Integrated Provincial Health Office, said the vaccination of the priority frontline health workers in the four other Covid-19 referral hospitals started Monday morning.
“This is a simultaneous activity and will continue for seven days,” she said in an interview.
She said they are targeting to inoculate at least 100 individuals per day in each of the vaccination sites.
The acceptance of the Sinovac vaccine is reportedly high in the other referral hospitals in the province, with one facility convincing 90 percent of its workers to get vaccinated.
In this city, the rollout of the Sinovac vaccines started Monday morning with Dr. Ryan Aplicador, the deputy incident commander of the City Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases and also chief of Dr. Jorge P. Royeca Hospital (DJPRH), getting the first shot.
Aplicador said he did not experience any adverse effects from the vaccine during the 30-minute to one-hour observation period.
A total of 670 medical professionals and staff members of DJPRH, one of the six Covid-19 referral hospitals in the city, were prioritized to get the Sinovac vaccines.
Also eligible are 697 workers from the St. Elizabeth Hospital, 527 from General Santos Doctor’s Hospital, 521 from Socsargen County Hospital, 380 from Mindanao Medical Center, and 343 from GenSan Medical Center. (with report from Richelyn Gubalani/PNA)

TACLOBAN CITY – The Department of Health (DOH) is targeting to inoculate more than 27,000 healthcare workers in Eastern Visayas region as a top priority in the vaccination rollout.
DOH Regional Director Exuperia Sabalberino said the pace of vaccination among medical front-liners would depend on the volume of vaccines allocated to the region’s six provinces.
“The top priority is our hospital workers especially those assigned in facilities that treat Covid-19 patients considering their exposure to the virus. The second priority is the public health workers,” Sabalberino said in a phone interview on Monday.
The first batch of 6,900 doses of Sinovac vaccines received by the region last Friday was intended for hospitals in Tacloban City and Palo, Leyte.
""Once we are finished here in Tacloban, our next batch is hospitals in provinces especially those that are catering for Covid-19 patients,"" Sabalberino added.
On Friday, Sabalberino led the ceremonial vaccination at the Eastern Visayas Regional Medical Center (EVRMC) with the chief of hospital, Dr. Salvador Evardone, as the first recipient in the region.
The EVRMC has 1,327 health workers and 200 service contract workers such as security guards and janitorial service personnel.
The ceremonial vaccination of Evardone is to show health workers of the biggest tertiary hospital in the region that their chief is convinced of the quality and efficacy of the vaccines, Sabalberino said.
""We encourage everyone to get the vaccine because it is safe. It is approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) which means it is safe and good for people ages 18 to 59 years old,"" Sabalberino added.

MANILA – The vaccine rollout should not be a reason to be complacent and the public must still adhere to minimum health standards, testing czar Secretary Vince Dizon said on Sunday.
The Covid-19 vaccine is an additional protection but safety protocols must still be followed.
""What we all have to understand, hindi porke nagsimula na tayo ng pagbabakuna eh eto na 'yung solusyon natin sa Covid. Hindi po. (It's not because we started the vaccination, it would be the solution against the Covid-19 pandemic.

""Prevention, detection, isolation, and treatment should continuously be observed,"" he added.
Wearing a mask and face shield as well as physical distancing are the most effective ways to avoid the Covid-19 infection, particularly in the areas where surge of cases is happening, Dizon reminded.
He said detection in high-risk areas, like the National Capital Region and Regions 4 (Calabarzon), Region 7 (Central Visayas) and 11 (Davao Region) and Cordillera Administrative Region, must be intensified.

TUGUEGARAO CITY – The head of Cagayan Valley Medical Center (CVMC) on Sunday received his first dose of CoronaVac, the vaccine produced by Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company Sinovac, to be officially listed as the first inoculated front-liner in the region against Covid-19.
Dr. Glenn Mathew Baggao told the Philippine News Agency that he willingly took the first jab to erase doubts on the efficacy of the vaccine.

Saying that he did not feel any immediate side effects, Baggao said the vaccine donated by the Chinese government is “safe and would further protect recipients.”

The 59-year-old doctor said he was qualified to receive the CoronaVac, noting that the vaccine is not intended for those 60 years old and above and 18 years old and below.

CVMC nurse Kathleen Allam administered the vaccine on Baggao while Dr. Rio Magpantay, Department of Health-Cagayan Valley regional director, and Dr. Leticia Cabrera, DOH division chief, monitored the inoculation.

Baggao said side effects like dizziness are just “normal"" reactions to the vaccine, adding that they intend to inoculate 100 to 200 health workers per day.

He hopes that the vaccination would finally put the Covid-19 virus under control.
Cagayan Valley received 10,800 doses of CoronaVac on Friday. After Baggao, the region's medical front-liners will be inoculated starting on Monday.
Magpantay said safety measures have been put in place for those who are in the master list of vaccine recipients, as well as a post-vaccination facility for those who have been inoculated.

The PNP, he said, initially received 800 doses of CoronaVac vaccine and additional 400 shots that were used primarily for its health workers.
He said four vials have been declared “spoiled” due “to bubbling/crystals in the vial which is a manufactural defect.”
As of last Thursday, Eleazar said 78 percent of all the PNP personnel are willing to be vaccinated.
He attributed this positive response to the ongoing information dissemination made by the PNP Health Service and the ground commanders.

Dulduco said they expect the delivery of the additional vaccines before the inoculation for the second dose after 28 days.

He said not all of the 3,138 target recipients have so far signified to get the vaccines, but they hope to convince them once the inoculation starts.

“We can still give them the vaccines if they change their minds after one day, two days, or even after a week,” he said.

Oco said they will start the vaccination on Monday and it will be conducted simultaneously region-wide based on an advisory issued on Friday night by the DOH-12.

She said all six vaccination sites have completed their simulation exercises and finalized their contingency preparations.

“We’re targeting to vaccinate 16 individuals per hour and complete the inoculation within seven days,” she said.

She reiterated that the vaccination would not be mandatory, and everyone has the option of whether to get them or not.

But Oco said they are continually encouraging all the target health workers to accept the Sinovac vaccines, which she guaranteed as safe and effective against Covid-19.

She said studies showed that the vaccine provides 50 percent protection from having symptoms of the disease and 100 percent from developing into a severe case.

“That’s a huge benefit for those directly handling our patients and our health care system as a whole,” she said.

 Rivera said the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines and the upcoming inoculation of local health workers is a “game-changer” for the city.

“It’s a major step towards our hope that we can already go back to normal activities soon as well as our target to fully reopen our economy,” he said.

As of Friday evening, the confirmed Covid-19 cases in the city already reached a total of 2,021 and with 78 related deaths but 1,823 of the patients have fully recovered.

The 120 active patients, mostly with mild symptoms and asymptomatic, are currently undergoing observation and treatment in seven local hospitals and two temporary isolation units. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

MANILA – Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) Secretary Silvestre Bello III on Saturday announced that they will issue an advisory on the issue of vaccination in workplaces early next week.
“We will issue an advisory, not an order on Monday. We will advise everyone that nobody can be forced to undergo vaccination without his or her consent and any policy that is requiring vaccination for work will be declared illegal,” he said in a Laging Handa briefing.
Bello said this is to make employers aware of this rule.
On the other hand, he urged workers to report to the department employers or companies that are requiring employees to get the vaccine before they will be allowed to enter the workplace.
“They can report it to our DOLE offices, we have city, municipal, provincial and regional offices and they can also call our hotlines: 1439 and 1438,” the Labor chief said.
Bello, however, said they have yet to receive any complaints from employees regarding the issue.
“We have not received any complaint yet. In fairness, the president of the Employers’ Confederation of the Philippines had said they will not implement such because they know that it has no legal basis and you cannot force the workers to get vaccinated, we don’t have the vaccines yet,” he said.

LAOAG CITY – Four top doctors in Ilocos Norte took the lead in receiving Sinovac shots against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on Saturday in the hope of boosting the people's confidence in the vaccine.
Dr. Norman Rabago, Ilocos Norte vaccination head, and Dr. Walberg Samonte, medical director of the Governor Roque B. Ablan Sr. Memorial Hospital (GRBASMH) here, volunteered to be injected in public to set as an example to the 87 potential vaccinees who registered in the hospital.
At the Laoag City General Hospital (LCGH), Dr. Crizelda C. Derpo, a medical and infectious specialist, got the first Sinovac vaccine injection.
The ceremonial vaccination rollout was witnessed by some employees of the city government led by Mayor Michael Keon and 61 other health care worker-vaccinees of the hospital.
Dr. Eliezer John Asuncion, the hospital administrator of the LCGH, said more than 170 health care workers registered for the vaccine rollout but only 62 vaccines were initially allocated for the Laoag hospital.
In Batac City, some 750 health care workers led by Dr. Jose Orosa, chief of the medical professional staff of the Mariano Marcos Memorial Hospital and Medical Center, signed up for the vaccination program but only 80 were expected to get their shots.
Before the simultaneous vaccination rollout in the three Covid-19 referral hospitals of Ilocos Norte, Governor Matthew Joseph Manotoc said the Sinovac vaccine has been tried by leading doctors in the country and there has been no significant side effect observed.
“I believe the benefits outweigh the risk and we just need confidence in taking the vaccine,"" Manotoc said, adding the first vaccination rollout in Ilocos Norte is indeed a “happy day” as it gives new hope for the people to move on to the new normal.

MANILA – The city government of Manila has completed the vaccination of 1,499 medical front-liners on Friday with the full allocation of the jabs given to the city by the national government.
Manila received a total of 3,000 doses of the China-made CoronaVax vaccine, which is good for 1,500 individuals.
However, Manila Mayor Francisco ‘Isko Moreno’ Domagoso reported that they found one CoronaVac vial already broken when they opened the box. The incident was already reported to the Department of Health (DOH).
Since the city started its Covid-19 vaccination drive on Tuesday, Domagoso was happy to announce that no adverse reactions on vaccine recipients have been reported yet.
“Apat na araw lamang ay nailunsad natin ng maayos ang vaccination rollout. Salamat sa Diyos, its been four days wala pang napaulat na masamang epekto sa mga nabakunahan na ng Sinovac. Alam kong yan ang ipinag-aalala nyo (In four days, we were able to efficiently rollout our vaccination program. Thanks to God, it’s been four days and nobody has reported any adverse reaction from the Sinovac vaccine. I know that is your worry),” Domagoso said.
Domagoso also thanked the Manila Health Department and all the medical front-liners who cooperated for the successful Covid-19 vaccination rollout.
He said that he was happy for those who opted to receive the Sinovac vaccines.
Medical front-liners who decided late on receiving the China-made vaccine now that the allotted doses for Manila have been consumed will have to wait for the next vaccination schedule.
Despite his previous commitment that he will get himself vaccinated publicly with the CoronaVac jabs, Domagoso said he respects and will continue to follow the national government's vaccination priority policy.
Domagoso explained that Manila’s Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna-Pangan got vaccinated with the CoronaVac despite being a politician because she is a front-liner, being a medical doctor.
Meanwhile, Domagoso assured that the remaining 1,500 doses of the Sinovac vaccines are properly stored.
“Yung natitirang 1,500 ay nakatabi sa ating storage facility para sa second dose ng vaccine after 28 days sa mga nabigyan na (The remaining 1,500 are in our storage facility for the second dose after 28 days for those who have received their first dose),” said Domagoso.

MANILA – The government has assured that the priority framework of the vaccination rollout of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) jabs will be strictly followed.
In a statement on Friday night, National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the framework prioritizes medical front-liners and health care workers, to be followed by senior citizens and other vulnerable sectors. 
Galvez also thanked government officials, civil society organizations, and other personalities for volunteering to get inoculated in public to boost the people’s trust and confidence in the Covid-19 vaccination campaign.
""We value your support and appreciate your intention,"" he said. ""Indeed, seeing our leaders getting inoculated will significantly affect the perception and decision of our countrymen on the vaccine program.""
However, due to the limited global supply of vaccines, Galvez said the government would have to adhere to the recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and President Rodrigo Duterte's directive to strictly allocate the Covid-19 vaccines to health care workers.
""The allocation of vaccines must strictly follow the priority framework issued by the Inter-Agency Task Force (for) Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) to ensure that those who have the highest risk of exposure and death will be protected,"" he said.
Galvez noted that the prioritization primarily targets to protect and preserve the country's health care system amid the health crisis.
""The same priority groups have also been identified by the World Health Organization (WHO) with respect to the vaccine rollout of almost 44 million doses from the COVAX facility,"" he said.
Galvez said all doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from the WHO-led COVAX facility must be given to the priority groups, starting with health care workers and medical professionals.
""Giving the vaccines to other sectors when not all health care workers have been vaccinated will jeopardize succeeding deliveries from COVAX,"" he said.
Galvez said all Covid-19 vaccines that are set to arrive within this month would be strictly allocated to health care workers nationwide.
""Initial deliveries for April will also follow this allocation until we have completely inoculated nearly two million individuals under this sector,"" he added.
Succeeding sectors in the priority list, including those who will participate in boosting public trust in the vaccination campaign, will be served once the country receives the vaccine supplies for the second and third quarters of the year.
""By respecting and following the priority framework, we will be able to reduce Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, protect the populations most at risk (from) the disease, slow down the transmission rate, and minimize social and economic disruptions.

ILOILO CITY – A doctor at St. Paul’s Hospital Iloilo, one of the four recipient hospitals of the Sinovac vaccines, has urged the public to trust the China-donated vaccines public and welcome the immunization program of the government as it is now up and running.
Dr. Ella Mae Divinagracia, infection control head of the hospital, said the vaccine was given emergency use authorization, hence they have full trust that it was studied thoroughly.
“We have full trust in this vaccine. We believe that receiving this vaccine will offer a 100-percent (protection) against severe Covid-19,” said Divinagracia, one of the first 20 recipients in the ceremonial vaccination held at St Paul’s Hospital here Friday.
Also receiving their first doses were seven other doctors, six nurses, three St. Paul of Charity (SPC) sisters, a medical technologist, a staff member at the Housekeeping Department, and an employee assigned at the Rehabilitation Department.
“At St. Paul’s, we are thankful for this. We consider this as a gift to receive the first batch of the vaccines from the government through the DOH (Department of Health),” she said.
Divinagracia added that the vaccines, along with the observance of minimum health standards, could “add up to their protection” at the hospital, especially because they were the first institution with doctors who got infected.
The hospital is one of the Covid-19 referral hospitals based in this city.
As of Friday morning, more than 300 of their employees have registered for the vaccination rollout that will go full swing on March 8.
The hospital has reserved 1,500 doses with the DOH and has so far received 400 vials.
Due to the limited supply, Divinagracia said they would prioritize their health care workers.
The hospital has been doing simulation exercises and is thus prepared for any eventuality that may occur after the immunization.
A process is being observed to ensure the smooth flow of the inoculation.
She said after the pre-assessment and registration, the vaccinee’s vital signs will be taken.
If he has a risk for a possible reaction, he will be placed under 30-minute monitoring, longer for those who have allergies, she added.
“We hope to have the same experience in Manila but if there are severe reactions, we are ready,” Divinagracia said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Ma. Sylvia Teresa de Pili, chairman of the Internal Medicine Department of the hospital, made history as the first doctor and the first of the 20 recipients to get inoculated in Iloilo.
“I don’t feel anything unusual,” she said when interviewed after receiving her dose.
Second to get vaccinated was Sr. Thessa Marie Ramoso, one of the three SPC nuns who volunteered for the ceremonial vaccination.
Aimee A. Sillo, officer-in-charge of the hospital’s Human Resource Department, said she would recommend that front-liners have themselves immunized regardless of the brand of the vaccine.
“I am a front-liner, a nurse by profession. During this Covid pandemic, it’s really a must for all of us to be vaccinated (against) Covid-19 regardless of the (vaccine) brand. The main intention of the vaccine is to eradicate Covid-19. No matter what brand, okay gid (it's okay),” she said.
Meanwhile, Divinagracia said she hopes the public would receive whatever brand is available because they have no idea when the next vaccine would come.
While the AstraZeneca vaccines have already arrived, she said they don’t know yet if there is an allocation for Iloilo.
“We hope that the public will also be able to recognize the role of the vaccine in preventing against the Covid-19,” Divinagracia added. (PNA)

BAGUIO CITY – Two of the first eight hospital workers to be vaccinated in the Cordillera region on Friday were support staff who help in the fight against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
Cyrence Romero, a utility worker at the Baguio General Hospital and Medical Center (BGHMC), said the only thing she felt while being injected was the needle piercing her skin.
Romero said she did not feel drowsy or anything unusual even after she was vaccinated.
“Masaya ako kasi ako yung magiging dahilan na maraming kasamahan ko ang magpapabakuna (I am happy because I will be the reason why many of us would be vaccinated),” she said in an interview on the sidelines of the rollout of the vaccination in the region.
Romero said as a “carer”, her task involves cleaning and collecting the wastes generated at the hospital, including the Covid-19 ward.
She noted that she still needs to maintain self-discipline and stay healthy even though she has been vaccinated.
“Hindi ako confident na hindi ako magkakasakit pag walang self-discipline. Dapat nag-iingat tayo sa mga hinahawakan at parating naghuhugas ng kamay. Dapat din na panatilihin natin na masustansiya ang kinakain natin (I am not confident that I will not get sick if I do not practice self-discipline.

Another vaccinee was ambulance driver, Fernando Tong-an, the first employee of the hospital to contract the Covid-19 virus.
A total of 1,801 vaccinees out of the 2,700 employees of BGHMC have registered and given their consent to receive the SinoVac vaccine.
Dr. Runez said 100 employees were scheduled to be vaccinated on the first day of the rollout.
“We will finish about 100 to 200 vaccinees every day until we finish all those who have initially registered,"" Runez said.

BACOLOD CITY – Mayor Evelio Leonardia said this city will soon be liberated from the scourge of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) and has become “part of history” in the rollout of the vaccination program in Western Visayas on Friday.
“It is significant and meaningful that the first Covid-19 case in Western Visayas was recorded in Bacolod City. So, let it also be put on record and let it be part of history that the first vaccination also happened here,” he said.
Leonardia and Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran led city officials in witnessing the ceremonial vaccination program held at the Bacolod Government Center.
Six medical front-liners in Bacolod were the first to be vaccinated with the Sinovac Biotech vaccine in the region.
“We are on the road to deliverance,” Leonardia said, adding that there is no longer a reason for the public to doubt the Sinovac vaccine after the medical professionals had themselves vaccinated.
The mayor said that most people in Bacolod are adopting a “wait and see” attitude, but after seeing the doctors took part in the rollout of the vaccination program of the city, he believed that more are expected to also have themselves inoculated.
On Friday morning, some 6,270 vials of the Sinovac vaccine arrived at the Bacolod-Silay Airport in Silay City and were brought to the cold room at the Bacolod Government Center Annex Building.
The supply is intended for 3,135 healthcare workers of two Covid-19 referral hospitals in Bacolod - Corazon Locsin Montelibano Memorial Regional Hospital and Dr. Pablo O. Torre Memorial Hospital (Riverside Medical Center).
It is the first batch of vaccines to arrive in Bacolod, which is part of the 600,000 doses donated by China to the Philippines.
Those who were vaccinated were Dr. Miguel Sarabia, president of Negros Occidental Medical Society, and wife Valerie Villarosa- Sarabia, who is a registered nurse, as well as Dr. Hector Gayares Jr., chief executive officer of Adventist International Healthcare System Philippines and medical volunteer of Bacolod City Emergency Operations Center; Dr. Dolores Rommela Tiples-Ruiz, infectious diseases specialist and president of Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Negros Occidental Chapter; Dr. Radela Yvonne Ramos-Cortes, an allergologist; and Dr. Carlos Javier Primicias Jr., a pediatrician.
On Thursday, Bacolod recorded no new case and zero death. It has a total of 5,838 confirmed cases, but only 69 are active. Some 5,581 have recovered and 188 deaths. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

Share",Joann Villanueva,2021-03-05 19:20:00,"MANILA – The Philippine Stock Exchange index (PSEI) ended the week flat while the peso finished sideways against the US dollar due mainly to the within-expected inflation print for February 2021. 
 The main equities index ended the trade down by 0.02 percent, or 1.12 points, to 6,881.37 points. 
 All Shares slipped by 0.11 percent, or 4.68 points, to 4,158.54 points.
 Half of the sectoral gauges ended the week up, including the Services index, which rose by 1.05 percent; Financials, 0.27 percent; and Property, 0.06 percent. 
 On the other hand, Mining and Oil fell by 2.45 percent, Industrial by 0.54 percent, and Holding Firms by 0.34 percent. 
 Volume totaled nearly 4 billion shares amounting to PHP7.73 billion. 
 Losers led gainers at 135 to 87, while 45 shares were unchanged. 
 Luis Limlingan, Regina Capital Development Corp. head of sales, attributed the flat close of the main index to the within-expected rise of the domestic inflation rate last February to 4.7 percent from 4.2 percent in January. 
 “Sentiment was rather cautious throughout most of the trading but turned into bargain hunting as investors assessed the statement of Fed (Federal Reserve) Chairman Jerome Powell,” Limlingan said.
 He was referring to the interview during the Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit wherein Powell said economic prospects have improved but the Fed is still far from fulfilling its dual mandate. 
 Meanwhile, the peso remained strong against the US dollar after ending the day’s trade at 48.56 from its 48.62 close on Thursday.
 Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort identified other factors on Friday’s foreign exchange trading, apart from the acceleration of the domestic inflation rate in February.
 Ricafort said these include the end of the government’s retail treasury bond offer, market optimism on the arrival of more coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines, and the correction of the US stocks markets amid the rise in the 10-year US Treasury bond.   
 “More Covid-19 vaccine arrivals and rollouts would increase the likelihood of a nationwide MGCQ (modified general community quarantine) sooner, thereby improving market sentiment and the overall economic recovery prospects,” he said.
 Ricafort forecast the peso to trade between 48.50 and 48.65 on Monday, and 48.45 and 48.75 next week. (PNA)

BACOLOD CITY – Six medical front-liners in this city were the first to be inoculated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in Western Visayas on Friday.
In a ceremonial vaccination held at the Bacolod Government Center, five doctors and a nurse received the initial doses of Sinovac Biotech vaccine, which were part of the 6,270 vials allocated by the Department of Health to two hospitals in the city that arrived just a couple of hours earlier at past 9 a.m.
City officials led by Mayor Evelio Leonardia and Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran witnessed the historic event.
“It’s a great day for Negros and for Bacolod that the vaccines have finally arrived,” Dr. Miguel Sarabia, president of the Negros Occidental Medical Society, said after taking the first shot administered by Dr. Edwin Miraflor, officer-in-charge of the City Health Office.
“We know that vaccines are the most effective way to stop the Covid-19 pandemic and to stop future epidemics. With the vaccination today, we would like to show to the public that we, your doctors, believe that the vaccine is safe, that is good for our body to be vaccinated so that we can go ‘back to normal’ again,” he added.
Sarabia, an ophthalmologist, took the vaccine together with his wife Valerie Villarosa- Sarabia, who is a registered nurse.
“Why did I have myself vaccinated? I’m a front-liner, I’m 59 years old. I cannot guarantee safety for myself and my patients all the time. The Sinovac vaccine has a 100 percent safety rate for serious Covid-19. It is a very good vaccine, with 100 percent efficacy…This one is a new vaccine for a very deadly virus. We are glad to be the first people (in Bacolod) to receive this gift of life,” he added.
Also vaccinated were Dr. Hector Gayares Jr., chief executive officer of Adventist International Healthcare System Philippines and medical volunteer of Bacolod City Emergency Operations Center; Dr. Dolores Rommela Tiples-Ruiz, infectious diseases specialist and president of Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases-Negros Occidental Chapter; Dr. Radela Yvonne Ramos-Cortes, an allergologist; and Dr. Carlos Javier Primicias Jr., a pediatrician.
Gayares said he took Sinovac as protection against Covid-19 because “it is the safest for me”.
“It’s unattenuated. It’s a dead virus. It has maintained its spike protein. It does not interfere with any other mechanism in my body except to stimulate the immune system to produce anti-bodies. That’s the normal, traditional way of making vaccines and letting the vaccines work in you, and Sinovac used that kind of technology,” he added.
Tiples-Ruiz pointed out that if a person has a choice, the brand of vaccine would matter in deciding to be vaccinated.
“But remember, we have an increase in demand and supply is not enough for everybody. The more people that are inoculated as soon as possible the better. We need to see this as a collective effort to address the Covid-19 pandemic. The safety of the vaccines is assured and the efficacy helps us,” she said.
Ramos-Cortes said that in a way, the brand matters in choosing what vaccine to take, but in times of a pandemic, the choice would be to be vaccinated as early as possible, and anyone should grab the chance to be vaccinated.
“I have no hypertension and I don’t have diabetes so I’m really okay with Sinovac. I would go for it because it’s the first vaccine that’s available for me so I chose to take it,” she said. (PNA)",Philippines News Agency

CEBU CITY – The chief pathologist of the Department of Health (DOH) in Central Visayas has remembered the “fallen heroes” who died while fighting the coronavirus disease (2019) pandemic last year, as she stepped up as among the first healthcare workers who took the China-made CoronaVac jabs in Cebu.
“I want to offer this vaccination that I had yesterday (to my colleagues who died because of Covid-19). I wished they were still alive and they would have been part of this momentous moment,” DOH-7 chief pathologist Dr. Mary Jean Loreche told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) in an interview Friday.
Loreche, who also is the Covid-19 spokesperson in the region, said she remembered sending blood and convalescent plasma for Dr. Karen Senen, pediatrician-neonatologist of Philippine General Hospital (PGH) in Manila when the latter was admitted for the second time due to coronavirus.
Senen was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after contracting Covid-19 while treating other coronavirus-positive patients in Manila.
“I don’t personally know her (Senen) but when she was readmitted the second time and they needed blood and convalescent plasma, I responded and sent to the University of the Philippines-PGH but sadly she didn’t make it,” Loreche said.
In Cebu, a couple who are both well-known physicians here also succumbed to Covid-19.
“It was doubly tragic for the family of Dr. Dennis Ramon Tudtud, one of the eight University of the Philippines alumni who fought and died in the frontlines of the war against the vicious viral adversary. Dr. Tudtud, a prominent Cebu City oncologist, succumb to the virus on March 31, four days after his wife, Dr. Helen Evangelista Tudtud, a pathologist at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC), expired after fighting the virus for 11 days,” an article published at the University of the Philippines’ (UP) website on April 4, 2020 said.
Loreche said she knew personally the Tudtud couple, saying they worked together for the same hospital in Region 10.
Dr. Dennis was a cancer specialist, Loreche said, adding that she handled his patients’ biopsies before treatment. The wife, Dr. Helen was also a pathologist like her.
UP also paid tribute to “eight UP alumni who fell in the frontlines of what has become a global war against the virus”.
“They died alone, with no relatives around to hold their hands as they breathed their last. Some still have to be buried, and others were cremated with no ceremony and no one to bid them goodbye,” the UP article read.
Loreche said she also considered her volunteering to the vaccination roll out to her family which she had not seen for quite a while due to the pandemic.
She also prodded other healthcare workers who refused to be vaccinated with the CoronaVac to remember their colleagues in the profession who died while taking the risk of serving the front-line without the benefit of getting a vaccine.
“And to my children, who patiently waits for my very rare visits in Manila as they understood my super busy work and my avoidance of exposing them to the virus. And to all of our colleagues in the front-lines, our families and countrymen, let’s be vaccinated and help save lives,” she said.
Loreche was among the five officials who took the first dose of CoronaVac in a ceremony at the VSMMC on Thursday.
Dr. Gerardo Aquino Jr., VSMMC’s chief of hospital, led them in the inoculation rollout and was recognized as the first medical front-liner who took the CoronaVac jab in the Visayas and Mindanao.
The doses that Loreche, Aquino, Inter-Agency Task for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) deputy chief implementer Melquiades Feliciano, and two other hospital chiefs were part of the 7,200 doses sent from Manila to Cebu for inoculation of healthcare workers.

GENERAL SANTOS CITY – Local health authorities are targeting to start within the next two to three days the inoculation using Sinovac vaccines among over 3,000 priority health care workers in the city.
Dr. Ryan Aplicador, deputy incident commander of the City Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, said Friday they are all set for the rollout of the vaccination, which will be conducted in six referral hospitals in the area for coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) patients.
He said they expect the delivery of the vaccines anytime on Saturday based on an advisory from the Department of Health (DOH) in Region 12.
A total of 17,940 vials of Sinovac vaccines for Region 12 (Soccsksargen) arrived before noon Friday at the Awang airport in Maguindanao and were brought to the cold storage facility of the DOH-12 in Cotabato City.
“We will start the vaccination either on Sunday or Monday, depending on the availability of the recipients,” Aplicador told reporters.
The City Health Office, in coordination with DOH-12, conducted Friday a series of simulation exercises in preparation for the vaccination activities.
At least six vaccination sites were established within the compounds of the city’s six Covid-19 referral facilities - the local government-run Dr. Jorge P. Royeca Hospital (DJPRH), St. Elizabeth Hospital, General Santos Doctor’s Hospital, Socsargen County Hospital, Mindanao Medical Center,
and GenSan Medical Center.
The local government has set up a cold storage facility for the vaccines at the city gymnasium in Barangay Lagao.
Aplicador, who is also the hospital chief of the DJPRH, said they successfully simulated at least two scenarios for the actual vaccination, specifically with the vaccines already available on-site and another with the supplies coming from the cold storage facility.
He said they also tested the screening process and accurately detected hospital personnel who has just recovered from Covid-19 and ineligible from getting the vaccine for 90 days.
The official said about half of the 542 identified priority DJPRH workers for the vaccination have already signified to get the vaccines.
He admitted that some are still having second thoughts and preferred the other vaccine brands.
“We’re continually encouraging our workers to get vaccinated now and expect that number to increase once we start with the inoculation,” he said.

SPMC officer-in-charge Dr. Ricardo Audan volunteered to take the coronavirus shot to show the public the Sinovac vaccine is safe.
“This is a shot of hope,” Audan said in his brief talk during the launching rites.
“We at SPMC are very blessed to be part of this historic event. Years from now, we would look back at this day. We are the first to bring new hope (in Mindanao) and bring back a normal and secured life,” he added.

Some 86 percent volunteered to get vaccinated, eight percent expressed uncertainty and the remaining six percent refused to get the Covid-19 vaccine.
“Surprisingly, there’s increased confidence in Sinovac among the healthcare workers,” he said. “In order to be a responsible healthcare worker, you have to be vaccinated.”

Sinovac, the first one to arrive, can only be administered up to until 59 years old,” Ordanes said during the Ugnayan sa Batasan virtual forum.“So they became anxious, because as you know, majority of our elderly citizens are already vulnerable and getting vaccinated might harm them instead,” he added.That is why, he said, it is crucial for the DOH to recommend a COVID-19 vaccine brand that would be appropriate for senior citizens.“That’s what we are asking from the DOH. What is the best vaccine for us senior citizens?” Ordanes said.“For me, I think, it would be best if we get vaccinated with a brand that would be recommended by the DOH,” he stressed.The Philippines is reportedly in talks with India for the supply of eight million doses of Covaxin developed by India.

Manila led the way in the formal vaccination roll out of the first batch of the anti-COVID-19 vaccines that arrived in the country.It was held at the Philippine General Hospital, where PGH Director Gap Legaspi himself became the first recipient of the Coronavac made and donated by China’s SinovacBiotech.Later during the day, Manila was fortunate enough to receive 3,000 Coronavac vaccines from the national government and for this, we profusely thank President Rodrigo Duterte, National Task Force (NTF) Deputy Chief Implementer and Testing Czar Vince Dizon, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr.,Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and the DOH family for being highly instrumental in the donation of vaccines given to the city.My ever-supportive Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna, who also happens to be a doctor, was among those who got vaccinated at the Sta. Ana Hospital where we received the vaccines and had them put immediately at our storage facility.Manila Health Department head Dr. Poks Pangan and Sta. Ana Hosptial Director Dr. Grace Padilla, as well as our Manila Infectious Disease Control Center head Dr. Nerissa Sescon, also took the jab and led the event to encourage other medical frontliners to follow suit and erase their hesitation.Much as I would also very much want to get vaccinated, we are adhering to the rules accompanying the donated vaccines which prioritizes the health frontliners as beneficiaries.As of this writing, the vaccines donated by the national government have all been administered to our health frontliners, all in just a matter of days and for this, I thank and commend the MHD personnel who carried out the entire vaccination program successfully and without hitches. We were also able to administer the vaccines to health frontliners from private hospitals and clinics on top of those from our public hospitals.Our many past simulation exercises of our vaccination program really paid off. Proudly, we were able to conclude the entire vaccination processes without any hitches, except for one vial that was found to be broken when our personnel opened the box in which it was put.So far too, no adverse effects were recorded among those who received the initial batch of vaccines.Now, the bad news. The current COVID-19 situation in Manila is very, very alarming. Imagine, 196 positive cases were recorded in just a single day last March 4.This is a first in recent months.Equally alarming is the fact that the occupancy rate of our six city-run hospitals is at 36 percent. Of the city’s 300-bed capacity, the total occupied is 108.At our quarantine facilities, the occupancy rate is at an all-time high of 61 percent.For the 371 bed capacity, the number of patients is 225.The record-high of 196 cases in one day was confirmed by the city government’s own RT-PCR testing that continues to be given for free to those who need it.The surprising spike in the number of persons getting infected is a serious cause for alarm, not only for us in the city government but equally, for the citizens of Manila, although the same thing is happening all over the country right now.The local government will never succeed in any of its efforts to fight COVID-19 without the active participation of Manilans themselves and as always, I appeal for voluntary or self-discipline.I also will not get tired of repeating over and over again my call for all to never, ever let their guard down. Continue practicing the basic, minimum health protocols —wear your masks, wash your hands and watch your distance—at all times.Also, I encourage all of our residents to grab the opportunity to get vaccinated once the opportunity presents itself. Without the vaccine, we are a hundred percent at risk of getting infected and even dying from the coronavirus while with the vaccine, the risk of turning into a severe case is lessened to a great degree due to the protection thatthe vaccines provide.***Gaya ng paulit-ulitkong sinasabi, kailangan ko ang tulong ninyong lahat.

Some 600,000 vials of the jab were donated by the Chinese government to Filipinos late last month.As per the government’s vaccination plan, medical or healthcare frontline workers are top priority for the vaccines.Asked who Palmones was referring to in his remarks, he said, “Some of the medical frontliners of Marikina who refuse Sinovac.” He didn’t specify further.“I hope media will continue (to be an) unbiased player in conveying the real benefits of every available vaccine for the Filipino,” he added.Some 487,200 vials from British-Swede drugmaker AstraZeneca and University of Oxford in England have also since been flown in to the country. This means that the Philippines–a country with one of the longest lockdowns in the pandemic –now has over one million doses of the sought-after vaccines.Palmones pointed out to this reporter that the research team behind AstraZeneca-Oxford in the United Kingdom (UK) were also composed of Chinese nationals.The AGHAM president looked forward to the day that COVID-19 vaccines are fully commercialized like any other medicine so it may reach more Filipinos.“Physical distancing, basic hygiene and wearing of facemask, properly, must become a way of life in the Philippines even after the commercialization of COVID vaccines to prevent new mutations,” he said.

Those who said yes rose from 58 percent to 88 percent; those who said no fell from 10 percent to three percent and those who were not sure decreased from 33 percent to only nine percent.Malaya also urged all local government units (LGUs) to conduct their own town hall sessions and community engagement activities in their respective LGUs utilizing expert speakers from the local medical community.“Now that the vaccines have arrived, all LGUs should start conducting town hall meetings, barangay assemblies to increase demand and vaccine confidence in the grassroots,” Malaya said.Malaya remains hopeful that the series of DILG-DOH town hall webinars will create a “ripple of effects into the overall Filipino population.’’ (Chito A.

Véron said the Philippines will receive vaccines for 22 million Filipinos under the COVAX facility, aiming to inoculate 20 percent of the population and put an end to the acute phase of the crisis.To date, the EU has provided P130 billion (€ 2.2 billion) to help 92 low and middle-income countries, including the Philippines, to help gain access to COVID-19 vaccines. “The EU has both a responsibility and interest to make vaccines available to all”.“The European Union has maintained its goal to work in solidarity for vaccine cooperation and multilateralism – none is safe until everyone is safe,” the EU’s top diplomat in Manila stressed.The first batch of vaccines delivered to Manila is produced by the British-Swedish company Astra Zeneca. At the onset of the pandemic, the EU has invested billions not only into vaccine research but also diagnostics, treatment, epidemiology, protective equipment, as well as modernization of health systems. It was the main contributor behind the development of the first safe and successful vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, making it the first COVID-19 vaccine authorized in the EU.

Next in the vaccination line will be seniors, poor and vulnerable citizens and essential workers.The government earlier declared that all health workers must receive the free inoculations before other priority sectors will be vaccinated.“Kung masusunod talaga, hindi talaga dapat magpabakuna pa si Presidente dahil hindi pa tapos ang mga medical frontliners (If the policy will be followed, the President must not really be vaccinated yet because the vaccination of medical frontliners is not yet complete),” Roque said.The President earlier passed up on getting the Sinovac vaccines despite the recent delivery to the country. The Chinese-made vaccines have not been recommended for health workers, and instead may be used for healthy persons age 18 to 59.The 75-year-old Duterte instead opted to wait for another Chinese brand upon the advice of his doctor.

Tomas, said.There is still a possibility of containing the spread of the so-called “super-COVID variants,” the South African B.1.351 in particular, if the Pasay City government will undertake quick steps along with the city’s residents in containing the infection from spreading, said Fr. Nicanor Austriaco, a molecular biologist from the Providence College in the US and a visiting professor in the University of Santo Tomas.“We still have a window to eliminate the B.1.351 from circulation. I am hoping that Pasay contain the spread. If the LGU can eliminate the B.1.351, then we are safe. Otherwise, we will have to talk about other options,” Austriaco said.In its March 1 report, OCTA Research said that the surge in cases of COVID-19 is already “inevitable” and that the only steps the government and the public could take is to reduce the potential number of cases by ensuring the containment of the disease through vaccination and practice of the minimum health protocols.OCTA Research chief Guido David of the University of the Philippines noted that Pasay City and Makati City have registered the highest rate of increase in cases in Metro Manila.“If this trend continues and the national reproduction number remains at around Rt 1.2, the country is projected to have 665,000 COVID-19 cases and 14,000 deaths by end of March. If the reproduction number is reduced to Rt 1, the total number of COVID-19 cases is projected to be 640,000 by month’s end, with 13,500 deaths,” David said.“On the other hand, if the reproduction number continues to increase and new COVID-19 cases continue to escalate especially in the NCR, the projection is 715,000 COVID-19 cases and 15,000 deaths by the end of March,” he added.“This trend has been reversed, with significant positive growth in new cases observed in some LGUs in the region. In this light, based on our analysis of the data and the past trends in the NCR, we believe that a surge in its early stages has already started in some LGUs,” OCTA said.However, it should be noted that this potentially serious surge in the NCR is still in its early stages and can still be mitigated, said OCTA Research fellow Ranjit Rye.He said the inevitable rapid increase in COVID-19 cases could still be managed with the “implementation of appropriate and timely responses to reverse this increasing trend quickly and to prevent this ensuing surge from becoming full-blown and potentially overwhelming the health care system in the NCR.” ",manilabulletin

I am hoping that Pasay can contain the spread. If the LGU (local government unit) can eliminate the B1.351, then we are safe. Otherwise, we will have to talk about other options,” the OCTA expert explained.Citing a yet-to-be-published data from Brazil, Austriaco said Sinovac could be effective against the B1.351 variant. “In terms of long-term goal, you may want to pick Sinovac over AstraZeneca. It will protect you against the variant, while AstraZeneca will not,” he pointed out.Austriaco cited that the detection of the B1.351 in country will not just be about pandemic control, but should also be about the “impact of this variant on our national vaccine strategy that we have just began.”“So we have just began (but) we have already been hit in the stomach by a variant that if it not is controlled or eliminated, will be more difficult for us to vaccinate the 75 million Filipinos in order to acquire herd immunity,” he said.Moreover, University of the Philippines professor and OCTA research fellow Ranjit Rye pointed out that “OCTA is not suggesting either not to take one vaccine or the other.”“There is a solidarity in OCTA to say that the best vaccine is the vaccine that is available now. We need to get our own health workers vaccinated. We need to get through our priority list as far as the vaccine is concerned,” Rye said.“Whether it’s AstraZeneca or Sinovac, it is still better than not getting vaccinated at all. There are differences and nuances to each vaccine but they can be used, they will be effective.

Does everyone have a local vaccination plan and comprehensive medical waste disposal plan? Are our LGUs ready to come up with one once they start rolling out the vaccination program?” she pointed out.“Without a local vaccination plan, these concerns could get out of hand, and we should be anticipatory rather than reactive regarding what threatens to be an environmental and public health hazard,” Binay said.She noted that the way infectious healthcare waste is being processed and handled at a snail’s pace since the pandemic started has been alarming.Binay has filed Senate Resolution No. 656 urging the IATF, in consultation with relevant stakeholders in the public and private sectors, to come up with a concrete plan on the proper handling and management of COVID-19 vaccination medical wastes in order to prevent harmful health risks.“Whereas, based on the Philippine National Development and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines (Interim Plan, January 2021), waste generated at the health care facilities after vaccination may pose harm and risks to the health care workers and communities if not properly managed,” she said in the explanatory note of her resolution.In her resolution, Binay further emphasized that proper planning and implementation of managing wastes generated in the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination is required, considering the complexity of the nature of the vaccines.She noted that the cause of delay is due to the lack of capacity that waste treatment and disposal facilities have.“And partly because waste haulers need permits so the DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources) can keep track of where hospital wastes go,” Binay said.She reiterated the Philippines cannot afford to play catch-up, especially as the plan to vaccinate around 60 to 70 million Filipinos would generate massive amounts of waste.“Our appeal then is for the IATF to make it part of the checklist for LGUs their comprehensive local vaccination plan and infectious medical/healthcare waste plan,” she said.“In a span of two to five years, we expect more than 70 million Filipinos to get vaccinated, because these are double-doses and that would mean over 140 million units for the vaccine paraphernalia alone. We haven’t counted how much tons of concomitant waste would be there,” she said.“I really hope that the IATF and LGUs are prepared once the vaccines start arriving. I hope the IATF would be serious on this too and not to forget it,” she added. ",manilabulletin

But for donated vaccines, nothing in the lawor provisions of the Universal Health Care law dictates that this should undergo HTAC because in the first place, the safety and efficacy evaluation is the mandate of the Food and Drug Administration,” said Duque.“HTAC is really an economic tool to evaluate the cost-effectivenessof the vaccines but because this is not to be procured, the FDA evaluation of risk benefit analysis sufficed,” he added.The HTAC is an independent body, in accordance to the UHC law, that will guide the DOH and PhilHealth “for the development of policies and programs, regulation, and the determination of a range of entitlements such as drugs, medicines, pharmaceutical products, other devices, procedures and services.” ",manilabulletin

Mike Defensor( FILE PHOTO)Instead, Defensor said portions of the slashed funding went to pork barrel funds, apparently for lawmakers.Defensoraired these claims as he accused ACT-CIS Partylist Rep. Eric Go Yap, chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations,of lying before their Lower House colleagues for claiming that the P20 billion slashed from the military and police retirees’ pension fund went to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) fund.Defensor said Yap’s claim is simply “not true”The former made this claim a day after the two solons debated on the floor in connection with Defensor’s allegations about the slashed funding.“The claim of appropriations committee chairman Rep. Eric Yap that P20 billion in military and police retirees’ pension money was diverted to Covid-19 vaccine procurement is not true,” said Defensor.In a privilege speech on Monday, Defensor, former chairman of the House Committee on Public Accounts, accused Speaker Lord Allan Velasco of denying retired personnel of uniformed services at least P20 billion from their pension fund to boost congressional allocations for infrastructure projects.Yap quickly rose to defend Velasco, saying that Defensor was mistaken about his accusations.Yap said it was he who decided to realign the fund to finance the procurement of COVID 19 vaccine.Defensor’s revelation opened a can of worms in the Lower House as Yap accused the administration of former Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano of slashing P70 billion in proposed budgetary allocation for the same pension fund when the 2020 GAA was passed.Yap also blamed Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab, his predecessor as appropriations chief, for the re-aligned pension fund.Ungab swiftly belied Yap’s claim, saying that what the Cayetano speakership re-aligned was P209 billion and not P70 billion.He also decried Yap’s accusations, saying that the re-alignment was decided by Cayetano and then Deputy Speaker LRay Villafuerte behind his back.In his press statement, Defensor said Yap was wrong in claiming that the P20-billion in the 2021 budget was re-aligned for vaccine procurement.“To set the record straight, the vaccine procurement fund approved by Congress, as recommended by the bicameral conference committee (bicam) and carried in the 2021 budget, was P2.5 billion, which is good for just a few thousand doses and which was the amount recommended by the executive branch at the beginning of the pandemic,” Defensor stressed.“That is the amount that is sure of funding, as it is part of the “programmed” portion of the national budget,” he pointed out.According to Defensor an additional P172 billion was allocated by Congress but placed it in the ‘unprogrammed part of the outlay.”This means that the budget will be made available only if there are excess revenues.Instead of relying on excess revenue collection, the Duterte administration decided to resort to “borrowing to finance the COVID-19 response measure”.“Through the bicam, Congress juggled at least P182 billion in appropriations recommended by President Duterte in his version of the budget. None of that, not even a centavo or peso, was added by the two chambers to the Palace-recommended P2.5-billion vaccine procurement fund,” said Defensor. He added: “The huge amount of realignments, including the P20 billion for military and police retirees, went to “pork” and other things, but not vaccine.” ",manilabulletin

I want to become an example to ease the hesitation of other people in getting a vaccine or not. This is really important because this will help us become immune to this virus,” said Labares, a physical therapy graduate of the Cebu Doctors’ University.Aside from boosting the confidence in the vaccines, Gonzales said social media influencers can also help minimize the disinformation going around about COVID-19 vaccines.“We need to boost this advocacy to encourage the Visayan community and the Cebuano community to believe in vaccination because this is a crucial step taken by our government as we gradually reopen our economy,” Gonzales said.

The country’s immunization drive kicked off Monday, a day after these Chinese vaccines, the country’s first supply, arrived in Manila.“Even the doctors, some are not quite keen sa Sinovac but that’s their right. They want maybe the US. It could be AstraZeneca, it could be Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson is US talaga ‘yan. It could be Moderna…Wala kaming objections diyan kung ayaw ninyo (We have no objection to that),” the President said during his televised address Monday, March 1.According to the President, the health workers could wait to get inoculated if they refuse to take the Sinovac vaccine.“Maghintay na lang kayo pag magdating ng bakuna (You may wait for the arrival of the vaccine) of your choice and not the ones being applied now to the people,” Duterte said.“We respect your decision on the matter,” he added.The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier allowed the emergency use of the Sinovac vaccines in the country. The vaccine however has been not been recommended to health workers exposed to COVID-19 patients due to its varying efficacy levels.The local drug regulator later clarified that this was only a recommendation, adding the health workers may still receive the vaccine if they want.The Palace earlier disclosed that the President was “perplexed” after the FDA advised against the use of the Sinovac vaccine on health workers.Duterte even summoned FDA chief Rolando Enrique Domingo to the Palace to explain such “colatilla” on the Sinovac vaccine even though the World Health Organization laid down the 50 percent minimum threshold of vaccine efficacy.The President has passed up the chance to get vaccinated with Sinovac drug and decided to wait for the arrival of another Chinese-developed brand.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Sinovac vaccines last Feb. 22, but it was not recommending the use of the China-made vaccine to medical frontliners who were attending to COVID-19 patients due to its low efficacy rate of 50.4 percent.However, the National Immunization Technical Advisory (NITAG) has recommended the use of Sinovac vaccines for healthcare workers, citing its safety and efficacy to reduce mortality.“Due to the ever-changing government’s pronouncements, we health workers doubted of what is behind the government’s insistence for the Sinovac vaccine. There are better options for vaccine that have the highest efficacy rate. Why the donation CoronaVac with a low efficacy rate is being forced by the government to be vaccinated to us health workers and the people?,” he added.The group stood firm“on their demand for a free, safest and most efficacious COVID-19 vaccine for all because they believe that health workers’ and people’s lives matter most.”“Many from our ranks have been infected and some died in combating the deadly virus.

Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the Philippines’ Declared National Policy Against COVID-19, of the available vaccine supply called EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics from South Korea.Glovax Biotech President Giovanni AlingodHe explained that the EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics was developed in Western New York, USA by POP Biotechnologies and has been approved for Human Clinical Trials. The South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety also approved the combined Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials last January 2021. The firm is just awaiting the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Authority (EUA) for the mass production of the next generation vaccines in South Korea.For the Philippine supply, Alingod said Glovax and Eubiologics are also in the process of applying for an EUA from the Food and Drugs Administration. Should they get the EUA by May this year and successfully convince the government to order the 40 million doses, Alingod said they can bring in the next generation EuCorVac-19 vaccines over a period of six months.He said Eubiologics can only produce 100 million doses annually in South Korea but because of its long established partnership, Glovax was able to secure 40 million doses. In fact, he said, other countries are asking South Korea to supply them with the vaccines at higher prices.But for the Philippines, he said, “It will be 50 percent cheaper than the first generation COVID-19 vaccines.” While the price is not yet revealed, Alingod noted that the vaccine being offered now by the first generation manufacturers costs between P3,600 to P3,900 a dose.Glovax, the only vaccine-focused Filipino pharmaceutical distributor in the country, has partnerships with Korean firm Eubiologics since 2017 and LG Chem in 2005. These two firms are World Health Organization (WHO) Pre-Qualified Vaccine manufacturers.Alingod said they have approached the SM Group for a partnership that will allow the use for free a space in their malls as vaccination centers for their host local government units.Alingod, however, said that the proposed vaccine manufacturing plant announced last Feb. 22, is tied with the Philippine government’s purchase of 40 million doses of EuCorVac-19 vaccines. This means the ambitious project may only be pursued if government purchases the 40 million doses of EuCorVac-19.According to Alingod, the vaccine plant will produce the next generation COVID-19 vaccine and the Pentavalent Vaccine in partnership with Eubiologics and LG Chem, respectively. The plant will ensure that the Philippines has a vaccine manufacturing capability and a facility that could be used for vaccine production in case of new pandemics in the future.They are reportedly in talks with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Board of Investments and the National Development Company, the investment arm of the DTI, for possible funding or minority equity share in the construction of the first ever vaccine plant in the Philippines.There are also other foreign groups interested to help put up the facility, which should be in an economic zone near an international airport. They are initially looking at Clark Special Economic Zone.Alingod, who reportedly started his company by selling his wedding gifts, justified the P7 billion Next Generation COVID Vaccine plant. He said the P7 billion investment includes the construction and the technology transfer costs.The planned vaccine manufacturing plant, he said is a complete technology transfer from Korea and the US from active pharmaceutical ingredients up to formulation and capable of producingany vaccine for new pandemics that may come in the future and make the Philippines self reliant.“Hopefully Eubiologics can help in vaccinating Filipinos and if takes years to vaccinate we can shorten the timeframe if can have own vaccine plant,” he stressed. Should the plan push through, he expects start of construction within the year.“It is estimated that the world could vaccinate all its population in 7 years and the local vaccine plant can help reduce that timeframe especially for the Philippines. This will be the legacy of our President Rodrigo Duterte as it will be in partnership with the DTI, BOI, NDC, Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, and IATF, among different government agencies.”As traditional vaccine manufacturers, Alingod said that Eubiologics and LG Chem have already produced vaccines in the past that were used by UNICEF, unlike other COVID vaccine manufacturers.And as producer of Next Generation COVID vaccine, he said EuCorVac-19 would be more effective to fight the newer COVID strains and other mutations unlike the first generation COVID vaccines which are only 22 percent effective against the new South African strain and other new strains found around the world.The next generation COVID vaccine can also be stored up to 25°C or room temperature up to 3 months and 2°C to 8°C for longer period, unlike the first generation of COVID vaccines which requires freezing temperature that the Philippinesis not well-equipped with.According to Alingod, Glovax is the first and only vaccine company to bring in the first pandemic vaccine in 2009/2010 during the AH1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic.“If anyone could remember, there was also a shortage of the Pandemic Vaccine during the AH1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic,” he said. “With this experience, the proposed vaccine plant can avert the current and future pandemic.”Since 2003, Glovax had brought in more 5 million vaccine doses of various types of vaccines, including Polio, Tuberculosis, Measles, Tetanus, Pentavalent, and Rabies. It is the only vaccine-focused company in the Philippines. ",manilabulletin

Rodriguez Memorial Center (DJNRMC), a Department of Health referral hospital in Caloocan, was the first to take the COVID-19 vaccine in the city following the country’s vaccination program rollout on Monday.PHOTO BY JOSEPH PEDRAJAS/ Dr. Alfonso Famaran received the first dose of China’s Sinovac vaccine shortly after 9:30 a.m. and said he did not feel any pain while being inoculated.“The best comparison dito is…pneumococcal vaccine. Yung pneumococcal vaccine, 30 minutes after, meron ng pain sa injection site. Itong Sinovac, wala eh (With the pneumococcal vaccine, after 30 minutes, I felt pain in the injection site. But with Sinovac, none),” Famaran told reporters after his inoculation.“Tapos yung entry ng vaccine…itong Sinovac [di ko napansin]…tapos na pala. Wala akong naramdaman kasi nilagyan nalang ng band-aid (I also didn’t notice the entry of the Sinovac needle. I was surprised that it’s already done. I did not feel anything until I realized that they were already putting band-aid on my shoulder),” he added.Since he is allergic to penicillin and seafood, the hospital’s medical chief said, he had to be monitored for 30 minutes until he was cleared of possible adverse effects.Testing Czar Sec. Vince Dizon, who also was present in the rollout and received a vaccine shot, agreed with Famaran.“Lahat ng sinabi ni Doc, ‘yun din naramdaman ko (I also experienced what Dr. Famaran experienced),” he said, “Mas masakit yung flu vaccine. Doon, medyo nakaramdam ako ng sakit. Dito wala akong naramdaman at all (Flu vaccine, for me, is more painful. When I got vaccinated against the flu, I felt a bit of pain. But with COVID, I didn’t feel anything at all).”Famaran and Dizon were only among the dozens of frontliners from DJNRMC who received the first dose of vaccine against COVID-19, which arrived in the country on Sunday, Feb. 28.The rollout, which was also led by Caloocan Mayor Oca Malapitan and Department of Health Assistant Secretary Elmer Punzalan, started at around 9 a.m. But by 12 noon, there were hardly any frontliners lined up for vaccination.A personnel at the registration site told reporters that more were expected to come by late afternoon.178 Sinovac volunteersIn an interview with reporters, Famaran said that only 178 of the hospital’s 1,111 priority workers volunteered to get the Chinese vaccine.Asked why only a small number of the hospital’s workers wanted Sinovac, Famaran said, this is because the vaccine has less acceptance rate among their employees.“Ang expected kasi namin is Pfizer-BioNTech, so…mataas yung vaccine acceptance noon sa hospital na ‘to: 95 percent (We were expecting that Pfizer-BioNTech would arrive first. So it has a high acceptance rate of 95 percent),” he said.“Well informed sila sa data eh (Because workers here are well-informed with the data), when it comes to Pfizer-BioNTech,” he added.But both Famaran and Dizon maintained that the Chinese vaccine has “100 percent” efficacy rate or “percentage of protection,” particularly against getting severe cases of COVID-19.“Ang healthcare worker, kapag sya’y nabakunahan ng Sinovac, 100 percent or sigurado syang hindi magkakaroon ng severe COVID-19 (If a healthcare workers is already vaccinated with Sinovac, it os 100 percent sure that he will no longer experience severe COVID-19 case),” Dizon said.Sinovac has 60-70 percent protection against moderate cases, and 50 percent against mild cases, the testing czar added.

Getting vaccinated is a moral obligation of all people,” he said.Galvez said that the public should no longer wait for the “best vaccine,” seemingly referring to other brands with higher efficacy ratings.“There is no such thing as ‘best vaccine’ because the best vaccine is the one that is safe, effective, and readily available to us now. What importance will it be if there is a vaccine that has a high efficacy rating but will come in the third quarter? We should get whatever vaccine arrives first,” he noted.Sinovac reportedly registered an efficacy rate of 65.3 to 91.2 percent based on vaccinations in Indonesia and Turkey although it had a lower rating of 50.4 percent when administered to healthcare workers in Brazil.In the first quarter of 2021, Galvez said around 5.1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be delivered in the country including one million doses of Sinovac jabs that are set to arrive in March alone.Also included in the shipment are 3.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the Covax facility, of which the first batch consisted of 525,600 doses was originally scheduled to be delivered on March 1 but was delayed by one week due to supply shortage and logistical problems.“After this [rollout], the supply of vaccines will start coming in. We will try to get all the available vaccines that we can and give it to our healthcare workers. Our pledge is to finish the vaccination of all healthcare workers in March,” Galvez said.Aside from the vaccination at the PGH, similar vaccinations were also held at the Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital, and V. Luna Medical Center.Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, PGH director, received the first dose of Sinovac jab from nurse Sherlock Santos during the rollout at the PGH. ",manilabulletin

The 75-year-old leader earlier disclosed that his doctor has advised him to wait for a specific vaccine brand due to his old age.“Ako, naghingi ako, personal. Wala silang stock na ano eh. Naghingi ako para sa pamilya ko pati sa akin (I asked for a personal supply. There is no stock yet. I asked for vaccines for family and me),” Duterte said during a press conference Sunday, Feb. 28, after welcoming the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China to the country“I don’t know if we would have enough vaccines for everybody but I think I can accommodate the — itong Cabinet members,” he added during the turnover ceremony held at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City.The President is not among the first recipients of the Sinovac vaccines given by China as he waits for the other Chinese brand recommended by his doctor.“My doctor has in mind. It’s a Chinese brand still pero hindi ito. Siya ‘yong nakaalam ng constitution ng katawan ko (It’s a Chinese brand but it’s not this. My doctors know the constitution of my body),” he said.The President made the remarks a few days after former special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo revealed Duterte’s preference for the Sinopharm vaccine. The newspaper columnist also bared he arranged a phone call between the President and a Sinopharm representative and that the former asked for vaccines for him and his family.Sinopharm has yet to secure an emergency use approval for its vaccines in the country. The Food and Drug Administration however allowed the Presidential Security Group to secure Sinopharm vaccines under a compassionate use license. The Palace earlier said the legal team was studying if the President can get the Sinopharm vaccine under such compassionate use permit.Even though he won’t get the Sinovac vaccine, the President tried to assure the public that such a vaccine is effective in preventing coronavirus illness.“I am giving the guarantee that it is effective. That efficacy is good,” he said.Duterte also encouraged people to get vaccinated, telling them to get their doctor’s advice on which vaccine to take.“Ngayon, ‘yong ayaw magpabakuna, wala akong magawa para sa inyo (Now, to those who refused to be vaccinated, I can’t do anything for you) or you might want at least you know in your lifetime, may kilala kang doktor, magtanong ka na lang sa doktor kung anong mabuti sa iyo (if you know a doctor, ask the doctor what will be good for you),” he said.He noted that although senior citizens like him are “discouraged” from getting the vaccine, he is prepared to get vaccinated. “Pero ako, since I get to go around and meet people to travel, baka kailangan ko (I might need it),” he said.

The Philippine government has set a 5,000-cap on the number of nurses who can be deployed overseas due to the outbreak of the pandemic.Germany made a similar request to hire more Filipino nurses, but Bello said he hasn’t talked to the German ambassador in Manila yet.“Our target should be to improve the environment here for our health workers so they won’t need to leave,” Robredo said in Filipino.Although a lot of people agree that health workers are the “heroes” of the pandemic, Robredo asked how the government is treating them.If the government is recognizing their sacrifices, it should protect them with just compensation and addressing their other needs.“We should look at how we are treating them, so they don’t need to leave,” the vice president said.“Our gratitude to them should not only be in words.

Personal na sasalubungin ni Presidente (We are excited because the vaccines will arrive Sunday. The President will personally welcome the vaccine arrival),” Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said over state television Saturday, Feb. 27.The turnover of the vaccines is set for 5 p.m. Sunday at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.With the arrival of the 600,000 donated vaccines, the national gov- ernment is also expected to kick off its inoculation program this week.Roque said the vaccine rollout can begin by Monday, March 1.“All we need is one day and then we will roll out. So, if it arrives on Sunday, if I am not mistaken, then we can roll out on Monday, dahil excited na excited na po ang maraming kababayan natin (because many of our countrymen are really excited),” Roque said in a press conference Thursday, Feb. 26.The government said it aims to vaccinate up to 70 million or two- thirds of the population this year to help attain herd immunity.

He said these health workers would not lose their priority status if they reject the first available drug.‘Other countries using Sinovac’Aside from the Philippines, two other Southeast Asian (SEA) countries also received their first batch of COVID-19 jabs from China’s Sinovac, namely Indonesia and Thailand.Indonesia – the first country to give Sinovac’s CoronaVac an emergency use approval (EUA) outside China – received their jabs on Dec. 3, and kicked off their inoculation program last Jan. 13, with President Joko Widodo getting the first jab.Thailand, meanwhile, got their Sinovac vaccines delivered on Feb. 24.Like the Philippines, Thailand is also eyeing to roll out its Sinovac jabs by March 1.Outside Asia, countries like Turkey, Chile, and Azerbaijan had already started inoculating its citizens with CoronaVac.‘Safety and effectivity’Countries that conducted clinical trials for Sinovac’s CoronaVac like Brazil, Indonesia, and Turkey yielded different results in terms of the vaccine’s efficacy.Researches in Brazil said the vaccine has 50.4 percent efficacy against “mild-to-severe” cases.In Indonesia, experts said the vaccine had 65.3 percent efficacy, while trials in Turkey showed CoronaVac to be 91.25 percent effective.As for possible side effects, a Sinovac official said persons who have gotten the jab usually feel muscle pain afterward.In a press briefing on Wednesday, Feb. 24, Sinovac Hong Kong general manager Helen Yang assured the Filipino public that CoronaVac has no “fatal” side effect.The World Health Organization said in its “Types of vaccine and adverse reactions” module said inactivated vaccine-like CoronaVac “may not always induce an immune response and the response may not be long-lived.”“Several doses of inactivated whole-cell vaccines may be required to evoke a sufficient immune response,” it added.

Debold Sinas on Wednesday directed all police units to strictly enforce public health guidelines amid the rising cases of Covid-19. The PNP chief also appealed to the public anew for greater awareness and cooperation in the implementation and observance of health protocols. “We cannot afford to lower our guard against the virus, especially at this point when the cure is already within reach,” Sinas said. He added that the police force “will remain vigilant in enforcing public health guidelines and local ordinances that seek to mitigate the effects of the pandemic that has so far infected 600,000 Filipinos, 12,000 of whom have died due to medical complications.” Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros, meanwhile, rejected the proposal to deploy military and police personnel to arrest individuals who breach health protocols. The senator deplored “the militaristic approach” to the pandemic, saying it was “a repeat of the mistakes of the past.” She said it would only delay the swift response needed to deal with the rise in cases which the World Health Organization (WHO) said might require the country to return to a stricter lockdown like in July 2020. “What is this, throwback to 2020?” asked Hontiveros. She noted that during the world’s longest lockdown, police arrested 76,000 people for breaching health protocols from March to July last year. “The cases did not go down and only overwhelmed health workers that they had to beg for a 2-week circuit-breaker,” the senator said in a statement. She lamented that deploying uniformed personnel was an ineffective and anti-poor strategy. She cited the case of the five youths arrested in Laguna at the start of the lockdown who were detained in a dog cage. “There is a way to enforce stricter health protocols humanely and non-violently. It’s 2021 already. Let’s do this the right way,” Hontiveros said. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, on the other hand, said civilians should also do their part “by cooperating with lawful instructions and following the proper health protocols.” “This is the key to minimizing the spread of the coronavirus. We are under a state of public health emergency by virtue of Presidential Proclamation 922,” Lacson said. “The country is still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.

C.: United States President Joe Biden’s massive relief plan is on track to cross the finish line on Wednesday (Thursday in Manila) with a final House vote, stimulating an economy digging out from the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and offering a lifeline for millions of families. The $1.9-trillion package, broadly popular with Americans and approved by the Senate over the weekend, is expected to narrowly clear Congress days before a crucial deadline, culminating a weeks-long negotiation over its cost and scope. If it reaches his desk, Biden — who made the American Rescue Plan his top legislative priority — could sign the historic bill into law by week’s end. But the plan that funds Covid-19 vaccines, preserves unemployment benefits for millions, and sends relief checks of up to $1,400 to most Americans can afford very few Democratic defections. All Republicans are in lockstep against the package, and Democrats enjoy the smallest majority in years in the 435-seat House of Representatives. A Tuesday vote laying out the parameters of the next day’s action on the bill augured its narrow path to success. The tally was 219 to 210 in favor of proceeding, with no
Republicans in support and one Democrat joining their party in opposition. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said he was “110 percent” confident the bill will pass. In an effort to drive home how this sweeping package helps the economy, Biden on Tuesday visited a business billed as Washington’s oldest hardware store, which has benefitted from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) begun under Donald Trump’s administration to help businesses stay afloat during the crisis. “We’re going to continue this,” Biden said of the PPP as he chatted with store owner Mike Siegel. The president took a jab at Trump, though, saying that “a lot of money went to people who shouldn’t have gotten help” through the PPP because some of the beneficiary companies were too large and therefore not supposed to qualify. Biden’s administration will tailor the program so that it focuses on businesses with 20 employees or fewer, he said. Left-wing Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted “Finally, our government is responding to the pain of working people.” The last congressional plan to fight the coronavirus, which has to date left more than 527,000 dead in the United States and brought the economy to its knees, was enacted in December. It expanded unemployment payments by $300 a week, and extended them through March 14. That deadline has loomed as Biden and congressional Democrats crafted their latest package, but it appears they will meet it and extend the benefits until early September. “It’s a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters.",Manila Times

WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe. PHOTO BY J. GERARD SEGUIA According to WHO Country Representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the LGUs should lead in the effort on early detection, quarantine and granular lockdowns to prevent increase in cases that may lead to a regional community lockdown just like last year. “We need to go back to ensuring that public- health measures are fully implemented and that the authorities fully implement the early detection, early quarantining, isolation of cases and, if necessary, limited lockdowns in [villages] with clustering of such cases to prevent further spread,” Abeyasinghe said in a news briefing on Tuesday. The Department of Health (DoH) on Monday blamed an increase in the number of cases in the country on the public’s noncompliance with the minimum health standards, an uptick that was aggravated by the presence of the B117 or the United Kingdom variant and the B1351 or the South African variant of the virus. Both variants have higher transmission rates and, in the case of the South African variant, may affect the efficacy of vaccines being rolled out globally. Abeyasinghe said the WHO is carefully monitoring the variants that have spread across the globe by working with different research institutions to understand how they act. He added that the current increase in the number of cases does not constitute a “second wave” of infection, as the region did not experience a true “flattening of the curve” or a decrease in the number of cases specifically in the National Capital Region (NCR or Metro Manila). “I would not classify this as a second wave… We should have seen a flattening of the curve and in the case of NCR, we did not see a flattening. We always knew that there is a thick chain of transmission although the numbers went down…. [there] were still significant
levels of transmission in the community,” Abeyasinghe said. He added that determination of community transmission of the variants is not possible because of the limited number of variants and that the testing for the variants remains expensive. “The number of variants confirmed is limited…. With limited testing for variants being done, the key issue is interpreting the findings and doing representative sampling and that is what we are doing with the DoH to strengthen, as it is not possible in an economic standpoint variant genome sequencing for every Covid patient,” Abeyasinghe said.

The police and the military had their own vaccination rollouts, with two persons who received their first doses exhibiting “very mild” reactions. In the military, the first to get the vaccine was Col. Fatima Claire Navarro, commanding officer of the V. Luna Medical Center. Her first dose of CoronaVac was also administered by Duque. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and Quezon City Mayor Josefina Belmonte witnessed the rollout at the V. Luna Medical Center. Navarro said she did not feel any adverse effects afterwards and the injection itself did not cause any pain. “I didn’t feel anything different after the vaccination. No feeling of heaviness, nothing painful and even the injection, there was nothing unusual,” she told reporters. She noted that they had studied all vaccines and their possible reactions and found all of them offered “appropriate” protection from the virus. “Now, what’s important is the timeliness,” Navarro said. “It’s important that we will save our fellow countrymen’s lives, our lives and our family’s lives against Covid-19.” Vaccination for military personnel is mandatory. Those who refuse face sanctions under the Articles of War 105. In Camp Crame, BGen. Luisito Magnaye, head of the Philippine National Police’s Health Services Command, was the first to receive the vaccine. He said he did not feel anything unusual, but pointed out that 24 hours were needed to monitor possible effects. At the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, two hospital personnel were taken to the

Those who are fully vaccinated can also visit with unvaccinated people from one other household indoors without masks or distancing so long as the unvaccinated people are not at high risk for severe Covid-19, added CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. Fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who has Covid-19 also won’t need to take a test or quarantine unless they show symptoms — unless they live in a congregate setting like a nursing home or correctional facility. The recommendations came as US states were moving to reopen schools and businesses amid a drop in cases. Some 59 million Americans have now received one or more vaccine doses — about 23 percent of the adult population — and the immunization rate has been steadily rising after a shaky start. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a two-dose series, like the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two weeks after a single-dose vaccine like Johnson & Johnson’s.

AFP PHOTO While the new guidance will come as welcome news, particularly for the elderly who are now free to visit with their healthy children and grandchildren, many restrictions have not changed. The CDC continues to recommend that fully-vaccinated people wear masks and maintain social distancing in public, or in indoor gatherings involving people from more than one household. And the new guidance does not apply to meetings with people who have underlying conditions that place them at higher risk for severe Covid. The health agency also continues to recommend against attending larger gatherings and advises against domestic or foreign travel. Scientists are now very confident that authorized Covid vaccines protect people against severe disease and death. There is also growing evidence that they stop infections — though probably not at the same rate as they stop disease — but more research is needed to get a firmer idea.  ",Manila Times

Undersecretary Bernardo Florece Jr., officer-in-charge of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), said in a statement that the LGUs’ preparation in coordination with the Department of Health (DoH) and compliance with the national deployment and vaccination plan played a key role in the success of the start of the roll-out. “A few days since the vaccination program began, we have seen the significant increase in vaccine confidence among health care workers with some hospitals even running out of stocks,” Florece said. “The local hospitals conducted town halls among their medical workers, conducted simulations, and did an inventory of their resources, so when the roll-out began, they were prepared and there were generally no hitches,” the DILG acting secretary added. Congratulating the LGUs for the good start, Florece said that the greater challenge will come in the next few months when inoculations will begin among the senior citizens and indigent groups. “But the LGUs have shown that it can be done properly and fast,” he said.

Valente, TMT",2021-03-06 00:00:00,"IN a bid to protect and preserve the country’s health care system amid the health crisis, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. assured the public that all jabs for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) to be delivered this March and April would be “specifically allocated” to health care workers. In a statement, Galvez said the government would prioritize health workers in its vaccination efforts until two million of them have received shots to protect them from the virus. “All vaccine supplies that we have received and will be delivered this month are specifically allocated to all health care workers from all regions across the country,” Galvez said. “Initial deliveries for April will also follow this allocation until we have completely inoculated nearly two million individuals under this sector,” he added. Galvez made the statement as he assured the public that the priority framework of the vaccination rollout of the Covid-19 jabs would be strictly followed. He explained that due to the limited supply of vaccines and recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, along with the directive of President Rodrigo Duterte, the allocation of Covid-19 jabs should follow the priority framework issued by the country’s inter-agency task force focused on the coronavirus response. “The framework prioritizes medical frontliners and healthcare workers to be followed by our senior citizens and other sectors. This prioritization primarily ensures that we will be able to protect and preserve our healthcare system as we continue to battle this pandemic,” he said. Galvez said the prioritization of health care workers was emphasized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of the Philippines’ agreement in procuring 44 million doses of Covid-19 shots from the Covax Facility, an initiative focused to provide equitable access to vaccines and which the agency is a leader of. On Thursday, a total of 487,200 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca arrived in the country. The WHO said that 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine would arrive in the country in batches before the end of May. “All the doses from Covax must first be administered to the agreed upon priority groups starting with health care workers . Giving the vaccines to other sectors when not all health care workers have been vaccinated will jeopardize succeeding deliveries from Covax,” Galvez said. Succeeding sectors in the priority list, including those who will participate in boosting public trust in the vaccination campaign, will be served once the country receives the vaccine supplies for the second and third quarters of the year, according to Galvez. “We remind our countrymen especially our co-workers in government that in these trying times, it is our moral obligation to ensure that our healthcare system is protected and will be able to withstand possible spikes in Covid-19 cases,” Galvez said. “By respecting and following the priority framework, we will be able to reduce Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, protect the populations most at-risk to the disease, slow down the transmission rate, and minimize social and economic disruptions. We need to preserve our healthcare institution,” he added. Galvez thanked government officials, civil society organizations, and other personalities for volunteering to get inoculated in public to boost the people’s trust and confidence in the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. “We value your support and appreciate your intention to help us boost the people’s confidence in the vaccines even as volunteering to take the jab in public,” the vaccine czar said. “Indeed, seeing our leaders getting inoculated will significantly affect the perception and decision of our countrymen on the vaccine program,” he added. Amid the continued rise in coronavirus cases, the government is targeting to give free inoculations to 70 million Filipinos to reach herd immunity. Meanwhile, one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Sinovac that the Philippines purchased will arrive in the third week of March. The Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer under the Covax facility may arrive in the country in April.

REUTERS posted on March 3 a must-read report on the pandemic that surveys how virus variants are impacting the views of scientists on Covid-19, and the vaccine rollout in various countries. As reported by Julie Steenhuysen and Kate Kelland, Reuters provides a revealing update on the battle between scientists and SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. I reproduce their report in full: “Chris Murray, a University of Washington disease expert whose projections on Covid-19 infections and deaths are closely followed worldwide, is changing his assumptions about the course of the pandemic. “Murray had, until recently, been hopeful that the discovery of several effective vaccines could help countries achieve herd immunity, or nearly eliminate transmission through a combination of inoculation and previous infection. But in the last month, data from a vaccine trial in South Africa showed not only that a rapidly spreading coronavirus variant could dampen the effect of the vaccine, [but] it could also evade natural immunity in people who had been previously infected. “‘I couldn’t sleep’ after seeing the data, Murray, director of the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told Reuters. ‘When will it end?’ he asked himself, referring to the pandemic. He is currently updating his model to account for variants’ ability to escape natural immunity and expects to provide new projections as early as this week. New consensus
“A new consensus is emerging among scientists, according to Reuters interviews with 18 specialists who closely track the pandemic or are working to curb its impact. Many described how the breakthrough late last year of two vaccines with around 95 percent efficacy against Covid-19 had initially sparked hope that the virus could be largely contained, similar to the way measles has been. “But, they say, data in recent weeks on new variants from South Africa and Brazil have undercut that optimism. They now believe that SARS-CoV-2 will not only remain with us as an endemic virus, continuing to circulate in communities, but will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come. “As a result, the scientists said, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask-wearing and avoiding crowded places during Covid-19 surges, especially for people at high risk. “Even after vaccination, ‘I still would want to wear a mask if there was a variant out there,’ Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said in an interview. ‘All you need is one little flick of a variant (sparking) another surge, and there goes your prediction’ about when life gets back to normal. “Some scientists, including Murray, acknowledge that the outlook could improve. The new vaccines, which have been developed at record speed, still appear to prevent hospitalizations and death even when new variants are the cause of infection. Many vaccine developers are working on booster shots and new inoculations that could preserve a high level of efficacy against the variants. And scientists say there is still much to be learned about the immune system’s ability to combat the virus. “Already, Covid-19 infection rates have declined in many countries since the start of 2021, with some dramatic reductions in severe illness and hospitalizations among the first groups of people to be vaccinated. Worse than flu
“Murray said if the South African variant, or similar mutants, continue to spread rapidly, the number of Covid-19 cases resulting in hospitalization or death this coming winter could be four times higher than the flu. The rough estimate assumes a 65 percent effective vaccine given to half of a country’s population. In a worst-case scenario, that could represent as many as 200,000 US deaths related to Covid-19 over the winter period, based on federal government estimates of annual flu fatalities. “His institute’s current forecast, which runs to June 1, assumes there will be an additional 62,000 US deaths and 690,000 global deaths from Covid-19 by that point. The model includes assumptions about vaccination rates as well as the transmissibility of the South African and Brazilian variants. “The shift in thinking among scientists has influenced more cautious government statements about when the pandemic will end. Britain last week said it expects a slow emergence from one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, despite having one of the fastest vaccination drives. “US government predictions of a return to a more normal lifestyle have been repeatedly pushed back, most recently from late summer to Christmas, and then to March 2022. Israel issues “Green Pass” immunity documents to people who have recovered from Covid-19 or been vaccinated, allowing them back into hotels or theaters. The documents are only valid for six months because it’s not clear how long immunity will last. “‘What does it mean to be past the emergency phase of this pandemic?’ said Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. While some experts have asked whether countries could completely eradicate any case of Covid-19 through vaccines and stringent lockdowns, Baral sees the goals as more modest, but still meaningful. ‘In my mind, it’s that hospitals aren’t full, the ICUs aren’t full, and people aren’t tragically passing,’ he said. Scientific whiplash
“From the beginning, the new coronavirus has been a moving target. “Early in the pandemic, leading scientists warned that the virus could become endemic and ‘may never go away,’ including Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program. “Yet they had much to learn, including whether it would be possible to develop a vaccine against the virus and how quickly it would mutate. Would it be more like measles, which can be kept almost entirely at bay in communities with high rates of inoculation, or flu, which infects millions globally each year? “For much of 2020, many scientists were surprised and reassured that the coronavirus had not changed significantly enough to become more transmissible, or deadly. “A major breakthrough came in November 2020. Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE as well as Moderna Inc said their vaccines were around 95 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 in clinical trials, an efficacy rate that is much higher than any flu shot. “At least a few of the scientists Reuters interviewed said even in the wake of those results, they hadn’t expected the vaccines to wipe out the virus. But many told Reuters that the data raised hope within the scientific community that it would be possible to virtually eliminate Covid-19, if only the world could be vaccinated quickly enough. “‘We all felt quite optimistic before Christmas with those first vaccines,’ said Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London. ‘We didn’t necessarily expect such high-efficacy vaccines to be possible in that first generation.’ “The optimism proved short-lived. In late December, the UK warned of a new, more transmissible variant that was quickly becoming the dominant form of the coronavirus in the country. Around the same time, researchers learned of the impact of the faster-spreading variants in South Africa and in Brazil. “Phil Dormitzer, a top vaccine scientist at Pfizer, told Reuters in November that the US drugmaker’s vaccine success signaled the virus was ‘vulnerable to immunization’ in what he called ‘a breakthrough for humanity.’ By early January, he acknowledged the variants heralded ‘a new chapter’ in which companies will have to constantly monitor for mutations that could dampen the effect of vaccines. “In late January, the impact on vaccines became even clearer. Novavax’s clinical trial data showed its vaccine was 89 percent effective in a UK trial, but just 50 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 in South Africa. That was followed a week later by data showing the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine offered only limited protection from mild disease against the South African variant. “The most recent change of heart was considerable, several of the scientists told Reuters. Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, described it as ‘scientific whiplash’: In December, he had believed it was plausible to achieve so-called ‘functional eradication’ of the coronavirus, similar to measles. “Now, ‘getting as many people vaccinated as possible is still the same answer and the same path forward as it was on December 1 or January 1,’ Crotty said, ‘but the expected outcome isn’t the same.’” My only comment on this is that the cost of vaccinating 50 to 70 percent of a country’s population is unrealistic and prohibitive, particularly if its economy has been shattered by the pandemic and the lockdowns. Vaccinating all humanity must wait until pharmaceutical companies can produce as many vaccines as there are people. Economists must take the field as resolutely as the scientists. yenobserver@gmail.com",Manila Times

Cirilito Sobejana on Friday presided over the ceremonial vaccination of military health professionals assigned to the 4th Infantry Division (4ID), Philippine Army in Cagayan De Oro (CDO) City. Transported from Villamor Airbase in Pasay City to the Lumbia Airfield, the 600 vials of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccine were airlifted via the Philippine Air Force C295 aircraft, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) said in a statement. It was then escorted by military and medical personnel to its destination at the 4ID Headquarters in Camp Evangelista. The vials were the first batch of vaccines that were delivered by the military outside the National Capital Region (NCR), according to Sobejana. About 100 of the 300 medical personnel assigned to the 4ID were expected to be inoculated during the ceremonial vaccination. “We in the Armed Forces especially recognize how significant a progress the vaccination program is in the fight against Covid-19 not only for our troops, who have been serving as frontliners alongside our medical health workers, but most importantly for the needed protection of our fellow Filipinos in highly-vulnerable conditions,” Sobejana said. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also witnessed the event at the 4ID gymnasium. They were joined by representatives from the Department of Health (DoH) and senior military officials. Colonel Jonna Dalaguit, Camp Evangelista Station Hospital (CESH) commanding officer, will head the vaccination campaign for military health workers assigned to the unit, the AFP said. “Because of the tireless effort and perseverance of our public officials from various government sectors, this day became possible for us to come together and witness the arrival of the much-awaited vaccine against the coronavirus,” according to the AFP chief. He said that the AFP was planning distributions to other areas outside Metro Manila through its land, air and naval assets. This is being coordinated with the DoH with regard to the protocol on handling and storage of vaccines, Sobejana said. “We are one with the government and the Health Department in the full force implementation of the National Vaccine Deployment Program. I am urging all members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to join this effort so that we will be able to convey to our people the need for their cooperation in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” Sobejana said.",Manila Times

https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/03/04/campus-press/are-we-in-the-same-boat/847234/,Are we truly ‘in the same boat’?,"Ernie Cecilia, DPM",2021-03-04 00:00:00,"On a cold night in November 2018, my friends Tony and Ludy (Cabañas) and Cynthia (Brawner) showed me around the Washington, D.C. memorial monuments. I stared at Martin Luther King Jr.’s simple monument in awe, and began to recall his legacy. Michael King Jr.
He was born Michael King Jr. on Jan. 15, 1929 in Atlanta and was assassinated on April 4, 1968 in Memphis. As a Baptist minister and social activist, he led the US civil rights movement from the mid-1950s to 1968. In 1964, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. While in a Connecticut tobacco farm, he saw that the races peacefully mixed in the North. In the South, racial segregation was the norm. He wrote to his parents, “Negroes and whites go to the same church. I never thought that a person of my race could eat anywhere.” On Dec. 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger. Parks was arrested for violating the segregation law. King called for the boycott of the transit system. In 1963, he landed in the Birmingham jail for leading more protests. On Aug. 28, 1963, he made his iconic “I Have a Dream” speech in a peaceful interracial assembly of some 250,000 people in front of the Lincoln Memorial. In another protest, King also said, “We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.” King was not the first to say that. America’s 30th President, from 1923 to 1929, once said, “No matter by what various crafts we came here, we are all now in the same boat.” The same boat
Germany and the United Kingdom were at War in Europe. When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill said to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Now that we are, as you say, ‘in the same boat,’ would it not be wise for us to have another conference … and the sooner the better?” Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, I’ve been hearing public officials say that “we are all in the same boat.” Now, I am not sure if that is true. Gillian Tett wrote in the Financial Times, “The cruelty of Covid-19 is that it has not just exposed existing inequalities, but that it is exacerbating them, too.” Tett also wrote about “the three Bs” among people these days – boredom, burnout, and breakdown. But if you look on the positive side, there is a fourth B – blessings. The pandemic has helped increase fortune for a few, and misfortune for many. In 2013, French economist Thomas Piketty wrote a best-selling book, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century.” He referred to capital as the “sum total of non-human assets” that can be owned or exchanged. He argues that “when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income … capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities.” Piketty’s theory explains what’s unfolding before our eyes during this pandemic. Because of existing monetary policies all over the world, people who hold assets have increased their net worth. Those without assets, particularly the “Ninjas” (No Income, No Job or Assets) have seen how their meager wealth, if you can call it that, has shrunk as the recession has caused massive loss of jobs, wages and purchasing power. Whenever public officials say that we are in the same boat, I think we are missing the point. Do they know that many Filipinos today do not have the luxury of having three meals a day? Or that many households have experienced disconnection of water and electricity supply? Non-economic capital
Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002) was a French sociologist, anthropologist and philosopher who was primarily concerned with the dynamics of power in society. He analyzed the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and maintained across generations. Bourdieu emphasized how social classes, especially the ruling and intellectual classes, preserve their social privileges across generations, despite the myth that “contemporary post-industrial society boasts equality of opportunity and high social mobility, achieved through formal education.” In the 1970s, Bourdieu argued that “capital does not need to be viewed just through the lens of economics.” In his book, “Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste” (1979), he argued that “judgments of taste are related to social position, or more precisely, are themselves acts of social positioning.” Like it or not, capital helps acquire power, and power helps amass capital. They augment each other over time. During a crisis, the power of economic capital tends to immensely reward those with other types of capital as well. People with strong economic, cultural, or social capital are the most resilient in both the real and virtual worlds. Those who do not have these types of capital are worst hit and continue to struggle. Emotional capital is a form of cultural capital. It augurs well for people during crisis situations. According to the UK’s Mental Health Foundation (MHF), people with “pre-existing problems have fared dramatically worse” during the Covid-19 pandemic. The MHF reported that “We are all in the same storm, but we are not all in the same boat. [There is] a divergence in people’s experience depending on their social and/or economic context in society. Differences in mental health impact will persist and likely increase.” Disparities
Here’s the main point: Capital, in economic, emotional, social or cultural form, can provide the needed resilience during crisis situations. If you have capital, you’ll be better off than those who don’t. There will be tragic inequities. There’s no easy way to fix them. From the economic standpoint, increasing inequity will likely drag down productivity. From a political perspective, inequity can engender corrosive bitterness between the haves and have-nots. From a moral perspective, inequity in crisis is wrong and must be abated, if not totally eradicated. As the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact different social classes, governments must employ more innovative ways of collecting and analyzing data to better understand and address growing disparities. This could help reduce barriers and ensure a more efficient and equitable means of addressing problems caused by this pandemic, particularly with regards to testing, tracing, treatment, and vaccine administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC has announced that one of its main thrusts is “equitable distribution of vaccines to all Americans, especially those who are marginalized because of race and ethnic origin and the associated poverty that goes with disparate distribution of wealth.” Civilized societies, like ours, are governed by laws. I think it was the late President Ramon Magsaysay who said these related but separate statements, “He who has less in life should have more in law. The little man is fundamentally entitled to a little bit more food in his stomach, a little more cloth on his back, and a little more roof over his head. … for the government exists for the welfare of the masses of the nation. A high and unwavering sense of morality should pervade all spheres of government activity.” When disease, hunger and despair reign, world governments should truly help the many who are poor. Or else, it might become more difficult to protect the few who are rich.

Some 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, but the delivery encountered delay due to “supply problems.” “Opo, iyong Covax facility ay inaasahan po natin na mayroon pa tayong 500,000 plus so sigurado po iyan darating ng Marso (Yes, we are expecting 500,000 plus from the COVAX facility and this will surely arrive this March),” Roque said in an interview over dzBB radio, when asked for the status of AstraZeneca vaccine delivery. “At kaya nga po kampante po ang gobyerno na tuluy-tuloy na po ito at sa lalong mabilis na panahon sana matapos po natin ang mga health workers, 3.4 million po iyan at pagkatapos po sana ay mayroon na tayong makuha para sa mga seniors dahil iyon na po ang ating susunod na target ng ating vaccination (That’s why the government is confident that the vaccination will be continuous and as soon as possible, we hope to finish vaccinating our 3.4 million health workers and after them, we hope to get more for the senior citizens because they are the next target of our vaccination),” he added. THE Philippines formally started its vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on Monday, a day after the first 600,000 doses from Chinese firm Sinovac BioTech Ltd. arrived. Roque had hailed the first day of the government’s national Covid-19 vaccination program as “very successful.” He said frontline medical workers who received the vaccine now have “peace of mind” knowing that they have some sort of natural protection against the virus. “Maligaya po ang ating medical front-liners kasi nga po nagkaroon sila ng peace of mind na bagamat sila po’y exposed dito sa coronavirus, ay meron na silang proteksyon ngayon (Our medical front-liners are happy because they can have peace of mind even if they are exposed to Covid-19, they have protection now),” he said. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised against the use of the Sinovac  vaccine for healthcare workers attending to Covid-19 patients because it only has a 50.4 percent efficacy rate based on data from Brazil. However, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group later recommended the use of CoronaVac even for health workers. Meanwhile, millions of doses are expected to arrive in the Philippines soon. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., for one, said a million state-purchased Covid-19 doses are set to arrive this March. Galvez likewise said at least 5.2 million doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines from the  Covax facility are set to arrive in the second quarter.

Even with the mass inoculation for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) finally underway, the government still has not fully convinced majority of the people to get their shots. Standing in the way are prevailing perceptions about the risks of getting vaccinated and the efficacy of some vaccines. NO FAN OF NEEDLES A personnel at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium in Caloocan City braces for the prick of the needle during the initial inoculation of health workers on March 1, 2021. PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN But a member of the Department of Science and Technology’s Vaccine Expert Panel warned in an online interview with The Manila Times that this was not the time to be choosy when it came to a Covid-19 vaccine because the virus had already mutated. Dr. Nina Gloriani, a microbiologist, believes that any of the three vaccines approved for use in the country is capable of providing protection against infection. Given the green light for emergency use in the Philippines are Pfizer and BioNTech tozinameran’s Cominarty, AstraZeneca’s AZD1222, and Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac.
CoronaVac has the lowest efficacy rate at 61 percent, while Cominarty has the highest at 95 percent. For Gloriani, the detection of Covid-19 variants and mutations in parts of the country means that the government must waste no time in immunizing as many people as it can. The Department of Health plans to vaccinate at least 70 million people before the end of this year to achieve herd immunity, the percentage of the population that has to be vaccinated to reach an acceptable threshold of protection against the virus. “Para sa akin, kung ano ang mauna d’yan, kung high-risk ka for exposure to Covid, you take the vaccine, a 50-percent efficacy is better than zero. Hindi tayo pwedeng mag-wait nang matagal, dahil ang variants nandito na (For me, whatever vaccine is the first to be rolled out and if you have a high-risk exposure to Covid, you have to take it, as a 50-percent efficacy is better than zero; and we cannot wait for too long since the variants are already here),” Gloriani said. The emergence of variants will affect the efficacy of the vaccines, although manufacturers were modifying their vaccine formulations to create booster shots against the mutations, she said. To prevent mutations from affecting vaccine efficacy, the public must continue to practice health precautions such as wearing face masks and face shields, physical distancing and continued hygiene. “Kung ang tao, nag-iingat mabuti, wala nang pupuntahan ang virus kasi ang virus, habang may malilipatan na buhay na cells, dadami s’ya at dadami; at habang siya ay nagre-replicate, mataas ang mutation nya kaya dapat mapigil ang transmission (If people are really being careful, the virus will not be able to transfer itself. So long as it moves to a living cell, it will multiply until it replicates and create a mutation. So, it is imperative that we prevent transmission),” Gloriani said. She added that relying solely on a vaccine’s efficacy rate could be misleading, since the rate could differ widely during clinical trials for a specific sector such as health care workers, adults aged 18 to 59 years old, or senior citizens. “If you test the vaccine in a general population where the exposure to Covid is lower, tataas ang efficacy mo, maiiba iyun,” she explained. Such was the case for the CoronaVac, which posted a 50.4-percent efficacy among health care workers in a clinical trial in Brazil. “At the time of the clinical trial, ang taas ng kaso ng Covid cases sa Brazil…if you are talking about 10,000 na binigyan ng bakuna — kalahati placebo — puro health care workers ‘yun and in a situation na mataas ang cases, mataas din ang possibility or probability na magkaka-Covid sila so mataas ‘yung gan’ung scenario (the Covid cases in Brazil were already high…so if you are talking about the 10,000 people who were given shots — half of which were placebo — all of them were health care workers who were in situations where there prevalent cases, they had a high probability of being infected with Covid, that scenario is hugely [expected]),” Gloriani said. The 50-percent efficacy threshold for Covid vaccines set by the World Health Organization was based on the different attack rates of the virus across the globe. In the end, what counts most is the protection the vaccine provides against the most severe infection. “With a pandemic vaccine, hindi natin expect na mapo-protektahan ang lahat, pati mild, moderate, severe, but what we are after, na ma-protektahan against the severe form of the disease, kasi ayaw natin may mamatay, may ma-critically ill kasi ‘yung health care system, papanik din ang ating resources doon (we still cannot expect to protect everyone, including those with mild, moderate and severe cases, but what we are after is to protect them against the severe form of the disease because we do not want health workers to die or be critically ill and to experience a strain in our health care resources),” Gloriani said.",Manila Times

The Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition unveiled an interactive map that shows 1,172 violent acts and attacks occurred against health workers or facilities last year, “a minimum estimate,” according to the NGO. More than a third (412) of the acts are directly related to Covid-19, it said, citing several examples including in Mexico, where a nurse was attacked and injured by a group accusing her of spreading the virus. In Dakar, three social workers had stones hurled at them by residents who refused to have a coronavirus victim buried near their homes. In Birmingham, England, a health worker was spat at and insulted by a neighbor. The vast majority, 80 percent, of the perpetrators of the violence were civilians, but threats also came from public authorities. In Egypt, health workers who criticized the regime’s handling of the pandemic were arrested by security forces and accused of spreading false information and of belonging to a terrorist group. Insecurity Insight, which developed the interactive map, also recorded 802 attacks in countries at war or on victims of civil conflicts, such as the bombing of hospitals in Yemen and the kidnapping of doctors in Nigeria. “The map shows that violence and intimidation against health care was a truly global crisis in 2020, affecting 79 countries,” said Insecurity Insight director Christina Wille in a statement. Leonard Rubenstein, the president and founder of the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition and a professor at Johns Hopkins University, called on international governments to protect health workers, including by fighting disinformation.",Manila Times
https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/03/02/news/deal-reached-to-get-california-children-back-in-classrooms/846702/,Deal reached to get California children back in classrooms,Associated Press,2021-03-02 00:00:00,"ELK GROVE, California: The majority of California’s 6.1 million public school students could be back in the classroom by April under new legislation announced Monday by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders. Critics panned the plan as inadequate. Most students in the nation’s most populous state have been learning from home for the past year during the pandemic. But with new coronavirus cases falling rapidly throughout the state, Newsom and lawmakers have been under increasing pressure to come up with a statewide plan aimed at returning students to schools in-person. If approved by the Legislature, the plan announced Monday would not order districts to return students to the classroom and no parents would be compelled to send their kids back to school in-person. Instead, the state would set aside $2 billion to pay districts that get select groups of students into classrooms by the end of the month. Crucially, the legislation does not require districts to have an agreement with teachers’ unions on a plan for in-person instruction. That’s a barrier that many districts, including the nation’s second-largest district in Los Angeles, have not been able to overcome. It also does not require all teachers be vaccinated, as teacher unions had urged and that could take months given the nation’s limited supply of vaccine. The legislation would make it state law that 10 percent of the state’s vaccine supply be set aside specifically for teachers and school staff. “You can’t reopen your economy unless you get your schools reopened for in-person instruction,” said Newsom, who announced the deal with state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon at an elementary school in the Elk Grove Unified School District just south of Sacramento. The district, one of the first in the country to halt in-person learning last year because of the coronavirus, plans to return to in-person instruction later this month. The state’s two largest teachers unions mostly praised the agreement, with California Federation of Teachers President Jeff Freitas calling the prioritization of vaccines for teachers “a huge victory.” Kevin Gordon, a lobbyist representing many of the state’s school districts, called the plan “a grand slam home run,” saying it “dismantled every impediment to reopening that we’ve had so far.” The announcement comes at a critical time for Newsom, who could face a recall election later this year fueled by anger over his response to the pandemic. Kevin Faulconer, the former Republican mayor of San Diego who already has announced his candidacy, said the plan Newsom announced “isn’t even close to good enough for our kids and teachers.” In this Feb. 25, 2021 file photo, Assistant Principal Janette Van Gelderen (left) welcomes students at Newhall Elementary in Santa Clarita, California. AP PHOTO “For months, Newsom has ignored science and left public schools across our state shuttered while private schools are open,” Faulconer said. “For him to tout this as an accomplishment after months of inexcusable failures shows how out of touch he is, and why he should be recalled.” In addition to the $2 billion, the legislation would give all school districts access to $4.6 billion to help students who have struggled with learning from home. Districts could use this money to add another month to the school year or they could spend it on counseling and tutoring for students who need the most help. To get their slice of the $2 billion, districts in counties under the state’s most restrictive set of coronavirus rules — known as the purple tier — must offer in-person learning for transitional kindergarten through second grade, plus certain vulnerable students in all grades. This includes students who are disabled, homeless, in foster care, learning English, don’t have access to technology or are at risk of abuse and neglect. Counties in the next group, known as the red tier, must offer in-person instruction for all elementary school grades, plus at least one grade each in middle and high schools. With new coronavirus cases falling, Newsom said he expects most counties to be in the red tier by the end of the month. Districts that meet the March 31 deadline get full compensation based on a complicated formula, while those that meet the standards after April 1 get less money. Districts that fail to have children back in classrooms before May 15 won’t get any money. The bill does not say how long students must be in the classroom each week. That concerns Jonathan Zachreson, founder of the parent group Reopen California Schools, who says districts could offer classroom instruction for a few hours one day per week and still get the money. He predicted many parents will get excited reading headlines from Monday’s announcement, only to end up frustrated. “It does not compel any school district to open other than just bribing them with extra money,” he said. “We need to have higher standards for what in-person learning means.” Newsom dismissed those concerns, saying he is “confident people won’t be gaming the system that way.” Cecily Myart-Cruz, head of United Teachers Los Angeles, said she worries the state plan would benefit schools in wealthier neighborhoods where the coronavirus is less prevalent. “This would send extra dollars to affluent areas that are able to reopen because of low infection rates, leaving students from low-income communities of color behind,” she said. Megan Bacigalupi, a parent advocate with Open Schools California, said she worried there was no urgency to get middle and high school students back to classrooms, noting the agreement does not require all of those students to return for in-person learning. “Framing this as a reopening deal is blind to the fact that there will be kids that will not be back in school this year,” she said. California Teachers Association President E. Toby Boyd praised the legislation for recognizing the union’s safety concerns, which were broadcast to state residents in television ads that started running last month. But he criticized the plan for only requiring coronavirus testing in schools located in counties where the coronavirus is the most widespread.",Manila Times

https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/28/opinion/editorial/confident-of-rebound-despite-challenges/846098/,Confident of rebound despite challenges,The Manila Times,2021-02-28 00:00:00," Economic managers, along with others monitoring the country’s pulse, remain confident of a healthy rebound this year. This is welcome news, given that gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 9 percent in 2020, mainly because of the response against the coronavirus pandemic that has killed some 2.5 million people worldwide. FIRST FOR THE YEAR (Clockwise from top left) Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Gov. Benjamin Diokno, BDO Capital & Investment Corporation President Eduardo Francisco, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd and former finance secretary and Asia Pacific Credit Suisse Managing Director Jose Isidro Camacho speak during The Manila Times’ economic forum, Rising from the ashes: From Pan-Asian to pan-global, on Feb. 26, 2021. SCREENGRABBED FROM THE EVENT At The Manila Times economic forum on Friday, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd sees a GDP growth of between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent this year, the same forecast that was announced earlier. Central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno said inflation would be “benign” despite moves to ramp up consumer spending and the cost-push price increases seen recently. Former Finance secretary Jose Isidro Camacho, now the Credit Suisse Asia-Pacific managing director and vice president in Singapore, pointed out that the Philippines stood to benefit from its inclusion in Asean or Association of Southeast Asian Nations. That regional bloc, he added, was expected to grow 6 percent this year. And finally, Eduardo Francisco, BDO Capital and Investment Corp. president, said Philippine firms were generally healthy enough to weather the pandemic’s effects. Assumptions and caveats For the most part, we agree with the rosy outlook. But as in any forecast, certain assumptions were made. There were also a few caveats mentioned by the forum’s speakers, particularly related to the Covid-19 vaccines and the quality of recovery expected, that policymakers and other national leaders should not ignore. First, Secretary Dominguez mentioned that Congress needed to pass as many as 14 pieces of legislation certified as “priority” because of their role in economic recovery. Among the priority bills is Guide — Government Financial Institutions Unified Initiatives to Distressed Enterprises for Economic Recovery. Urgent amendments were also needed in the Foreign Investment Act, Public Service Act and Retail Trade Liberalization Act. These, the secretary added, would complement the country’s participation in the RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the largest multilateral trade agreement in the world. Whether Congress will buckle down to work on these proposals amid the distractions from the upcoming elections is yet to be seen. We should be vigilant against and intolerant of delays. Speaking of RCEP, Mr. Camacho was bullish about that multilateral agreement but explained that the dividends from it would not be seen soon. Meanwhile, the government has to do better in acquiring Covid-19 vaccines. We agree. As we pointed out many times in this space, the Philippine economy is consumption-led. Personal spending accounts for about 70 percent of GDP. And so, an economic recovery effort has to be anchored on easing the quarantine measures and bolstering consumer confidence by ensuring public health safety. The way to do that is to inoculate enough Filipinos to establish herd immunity. Regrettably, vaccines are proving to be difficult to acquire, a situation resulting from the perilous combination of global supply issues and poor administration of this health crisis. Worse, the slow vaccine rollout, which hopefully starts today, exacerbated the wealth gap, as well as the divide between the politically connected and others without similar connections. That matters and not only because viruses do not discriminate according to income brackets and political camps. Of course, there is labor. Most workers will not qualify to be among those on the priority list of people to be inoculated. If workers remain unprotected from the virus, restarting industries will be a struggle. There are also small enterprises, which are more vulnerable to the economic fallout. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) account for more than 96 percent of all registered firms in the country. MSMEs also employ 62.4 percent of the labor force, and they contribute 35.7 percent of the value added and 25 percent of export revenues.
To be fair, the Duterte government’s mantra is to “heal as one.” That sounds reassuring, but not everyone appears to be on the same page, so to speak. Instead, many seem more Darwinian — that is, survival of the fittest in terms of wealth and privilege. National leaders need to address these inequities, if the rosy economic forecasts mentioned earlier are to be realized.",Manila Times

Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. TMT file photo Speaking in Filipino during an interview with state-run PTV 4 on Saturday, Roque said the “change in protocol” also meant that the health workers could wait for their preferred brand. Roque gave the assurance as 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the first batch that the Philippines will be receiving from its manufacturer Sinovac Biotech Ltd., and 525,600 doses from British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca through the Covax Facility will be arriving on Sunday and Monday, respectively. It also came a day after health personnel from the Philippine General Hospital protested against the government plan to inoculate them with the Chinese-made vaccine and demanded that they be given “the safest dose” with the “highest efficacy rate” although they did not name a specific brand. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) had approved the recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and the Department of Health’s Technical Advisory Group to allow the administration of Sinovac vaccines to frontline medical workers. The IATF-EID’s approval comes despite results of clinical trials showing that the Sinovac vaccine only has a 50.4-percent efficacy rate among health care workers exposed to Covid-19. The Palace official clarified that the new rule would only apply to health care workers because of the condition stipulated in the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued to Sinovac. “Pang-health care workers lang po iyan. Sa lahat po, kinakailangan po talaga kung ano ang naririyan ay tatanggapin natin (That’s just for health care workers. So, the rest must accept whatever vaccine is available),” Roque said. Nonetheless, Roque said no one would be forced to take CoronaVac. The FDA had allowed the emergency use of CoronaVac on healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 not including health care workers. On Wednesday, Roque said the government decided to administer the Sinovac vaccine to “economic frontliners” from 18 to 59 years old. He said Cabinet officials and even Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo might also be among the first in line to receive the vaccines from Sinovac. Roque said the government was “excited” over the delivery of the vaccines with President Rodrigo Duterte himself personally attending the ceremony prepared at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City on Sunday afternoon. AstraZeneca, too A day after the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines, the first round of the allocated doses from AstraZeneca from the Covax Facility will be arriving at noontime on Monday, Roque announced late Saturday in a statement. “This forms part of the 44 million doses of Covax to inoculate 20 percent of our population,” he said. Roque thanked the co-leaders of the Covax Facility — World Health Organization, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund — toward this end. The Philippines stands to get 9.4 million doses from AstraZeneca and US drugmaker Pfizer-BioNTech through the Covax Facility, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had said. The FDA has previously granted EUAs to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. MMDA ready In anticipation of the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) announced on Saturday that it was ready to deliver the first batch of vaccines to their destinations. MMDA Chairman Benjamin Abalos Jr. said the vaccines would initially be stored at the Health department’s cold storage warehouse in Marikina City. Abalos said during the Laging Handa public briefing on PTV-4 that the MMDA’s Bus Carousel along EDSA or its adjoining lane would be used to hasten the delivery of the vaccines to at least 30 hospitals. Abalos said based on their simulations, they might be able to make the deliveries from the warehouse to the different hospitals in Metro Manila where the vaccines would be administered earlier than expected and advised motorists passing through the same route to give way to the six 40-foot container vans.",Manila Times

Also under GCQ are, for Luzon, Batangas and some areas in the Cordillera Administrative Region which include Apayao, Kalinga and Mountain Province; Tacloban City for the Visayas; Iligan City and Lanao del Sur for Mindanao, he said. The rest of the country, meanwhile, will be under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). “The above mentioned risk-level classifications will take effect starting Monday, March 1 until March 31, 2021,” Roque added. The new community quarantine classifications came days after Duterte rejected the proposal to place the country under MGCQ until the country’s Covid-19 vaccination program has started. Nine of 17 mayors in the capital region had backed a shift to MGCQ by March, which marks a year since the country was first placed under quarantine. Metro Manila, which accounts for about a third of the country’s gross domestic product, has been under GCQ since August 2020, with stricter lockdowns enforced in the earlier months as Covid-19 infections rose. To date, the country recorded 568,680 Covid-19 cases, with 524,042 recoveries and 12,201 deaths. The country has yet to receive any Covid-19 shot, with which it hoped to launch its vaccination drive this month, and cover up to 70 million people or two-thirds of the population through the year.

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT PHOTO JUST like other governments in the world grappling with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, the Duterte administration’s fight against the deadly virus got off to a rough start but started showing improvements after recalibrating its strategy by balancing the effective control of the disease, as well as the socioeconomic costs. Malacañang has released at least 33 coronavirus-related issuances, including Proclamation 922, which President Rodrigo Duterte signed on March 8 to declare a State of Public Health Emergency to mobilize government and non-government agencies to respond to the impending health crisis. “The declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency would capacitate government agencies and (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community,” the proclamation read. On Mar. 16, Duterte placed the entire Luzon under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) until Apr. 12. On the same day, he signed Proclamation 929 declaring a state of calamity throughout the country after health authorities confirmed that community-based transmission of Covid-19 has already occurred. “Such declaration will, among others, afford the national government, as well as LGUs ample latitude to utilize appropriate funds, including the Quick Response Fund, in their disaster preparedness and response efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 and to continue to provide basic services to the affected population,” it read. Bayanihan laws
To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, Duterte signed Republic Act (RA) 11469, also known as the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act of 2020 (Bayanihan 1), a day after Congress passed the bill on Mar. 24. Under the law, Duterte, for a limited time, was given special powers, including reallocation of government funds to address the prevailing health crisis. With the law in effect, the government was given the authority to expedite and streamline the accreditation of testing kits to facilitate prompt testing and immediate isolation and treatment of patients. Health care workers, considered as among the frontliners in the fight against Covid-19, had to be provided with Covid-19 special risk allowances in addition to their hazard pay. Their Covid-19-related medical expenses were also shouldered by the government. The government was also given the authority to provide compensation of P100,000 to health care workers who contracted severe Covid-19 infection while in the line of duty while P1 million may be provided to health care workers who die while fighting the pandemic. Banks and other financial institutions were ordered to implement grace periods for the payment of loans without incurring interests, penalties, fees, or other charges. In September, he signed RA 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2), which extended Duterte’s special powers for handling the pandemic and provide a P165.5-billion fund to address the health crisis. The largest chunk of the budget was allotted to loans for sectors hit by the pandemic, such as micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises, transport, tourism, and agriculture. It also provided for the government’s Covid-19 health-related response. Cash aid
Among the most salient features of the Bayanihan 1 law was the allocation of P200 billion worth of emergency subsidies to fund the government’s Social Amelioration Program (SAP), which granted a P5,000 to P8,000 monthly cash aid to about 18 million low-income Filipino families affected by the pandemic. The cash aid program was said to be the “largest financial aid package ever granted to Filipino households.” However, the SAP encountered delays in the release and distribution of funds. Despite hiccups, 71 percent of Filipino families said they received cash aid from the government since the start of the pandemic, according to SWS survey conducted from Sep. 17 to 20. Besides the SAP, the government also had other cash aid programs for the most vulnerable sectors affected by the lockdown, such as the Abot Kamay ang Pagtulong (AKAP), Tulong Panghanap-buhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD), and the Covid-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP). Duterte threatened to detain politicians who would engage in corruption amid the prevailing health crisis, saying that the public should never be deceived, especially in these trying times. On Nov. 10, he offered a cash prize worth P50,000 to P100,000 to anyone who could report dishonest government officials and their corruption activities. Test, Trace, Treat
In April, the government started its mass testing initiatives following the accreditation of several hospitals for Covid-19 testing. The government had also started purchasing more rapid antibody test kits, aiming to test 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the country’s 110 million population to get a clear picture of Covid-19 infections in the Philippines. On May 6, Duterte inked Executive Order (EO) 114 institutionalizing the “Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-Asa” program designed to help low-income families in Metro Manila resettle in their home provinces by assisting their transition with support and incentives on transportation, subsistence, and education, among others. “Balik Probinsya” was temporarily suspended to prioritize the short-term “Hatid Probinsya” or the provision of transportation assistance to locally stranded individuals and overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) stranded in Manila due to travel restrictions imposed under community quarantine. To ensure the health and safety of students, the President on July 17 signed RA 11480, which reschedules the start of the school year in case of a state of emergency or state of calamity. The opening of classes for School Year 2020-2021 kicked off on Oct. 5. He also stood by his decision not to allow face-to-face (F2F) classes until a vaccine for Covid-19 is available in the country. Although he initially approved pilot F2F classes in areas with low risk of Covid-19 on Dec. 14, he withdrew this plan a week after a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, emerged in the UK. In his fifth and penultimate State of the Nation Address on July 27, Duterte admitted that there were “lessons to be learned” from the Covid-19 pandemic. “The gains we achieved in the first three-and-a-half years were put to a test when the pandemic suddenly struck the global community. While I am aware that the road toward a comfortable life for all would be far easy if pandemic had not occurred and along the rest of the world we suffered,” he said. However, Duterte said the country was able to withstand the challenges brought about by the health crisis. He also vowed to facilitate the country’s economic recovery. “The global scale and socio-economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been unprecedented. Yet in the throes of this global health emergency, we have been able to withstand the headwinds generated by this coronavirus,” Duterte added. In August, the One Hospital Command system was launched to improve the referral system and interoperability of public and private health care facilities treating patients with Covid-19. In the same month, Duterte said he would volunteer to be among the first to be inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Russia, Sputnik V, to show “great trust.” Malacañang, however, said the President would first have to receive approval from the Presidential Security Group (PSG) before he is permitted to push through. Also in August, he formed a task force headed by the Department of Justice to investigate alleged corruption in the state-run Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) amid the pandemic. He also ordered the implementation of a reshuffle within the state insurance firm following the appointment of new PhilHealth chief Dante Gierran. Equal access to vaccines
On Sep. 23, Duterte, for the first time, participated in the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, where he stressed the importance of ensuring universal access to anti-Covid-19 technologies and products, including a safe and effective vaccine. “When the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor withheld. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy. The Philippines joins our partners in the Asean and the Non-Aligned Movement in raising our collective voice: the Covid-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good. Let us be clear on this,” he said. Duterte reiterated his call for equal access to vaccines in his speech during the 37th Asean Summit on Nov. 12, adding that the immediate priority right now should be “health security.” “We must work together to ensure that all nations – rich or poor – will have access to safe vaccines. No one is safe until all of us are safe,” he said. On Oct. 27, Duterte said he favored a government-to-government transaction in the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines, saying it would prevent the risk of corruption. In November, Duterte signed EO 118 placing a price cap on reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and test kits for Covid-19. In signing the EO, the President recognized the priority of the state to ensure that the general public, especially those from low- and middle-income households, have “equitable access” to quality and affordable health care services, such as Covid-19 tests. Although initially against the payment of reservation fees, Duterte on Nov. 19 approved the recommendation to make advance payments to suppliers of potential Covid-19 vaccines. He agreed to enter into advance market commitments (AMCs) to avoid being among the last countries to acquire a vaccine. He approved the recommendation a day after he noted that the government must get the “best bargain” for the country’s supply of Covid-19 vaccines once available. On Dec. 1, Duterte, through EO 121, granted authority to the Food and Drug Administration to issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Covid-19 drugs and vaccines subject to several conditions. The EUA is expected to speed up the processing time for approval of potential vaccines from six months to 21 to 28 days. Every Monday night, Duterte presides over a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) core members before his talk to the people to give the public updates on the government’s fight against the pandemic. In several speeches, he assured the public that the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines for Filipinos would be free from corruption. The poorest of the poor, the elderly, uniformed personnel, health care workers, and those with comorbidities will be prioritized in the government’s immunization drive. As Covid-19 vaccines remain unavailable, Duterte has repeatedly reminded the public to strictly observe health and safety protocols, particularly the wearing of face masks and face shields, washing of hands, and physical distancing. He cut short his Christmas vacation to meet with government officials on the new strain of SARS-COV-2 found in the UK on Dec. 26. During the meeting, he suggested the creation of a new task force that would focus on the new strain. Duterte later approved a recommendation to temporarily ban “all foreign travelers” from the UK and 19 other countries from entering the Philippines until Jan. 15, 2021. On Dec. 28, he signed the P4.5 trillion national budget for 2021 that includes funds allotted to boost government efforts to respond to the pandemic and provide critical measures to aid the economic and social sectors.",Manila Times
https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/25/campus-press/under-new-management/844967/,‘Under new management’,"Ernie Cecilia, DPM",2021-02-25 00:00:00,"When I was young and silly, I walked the streets in Manila on hot summer days to hunt for a full-time job. After graduating from a university high school in the country’s typhoon belt, I wanted to pursue college education in the university belt in Manila. But I first needed a job to finance my college education. Before I enrolled in college, I literally walked along Taft, Escolta, Dasmariñas, Tetuan, Avenida Rizal and Azcarraga to find a decent albeit menial job. There was no internet, Google or company websites then to make job hunting easy. Every day, I would meet ever changing faces coming my way, as I looked at street signs to my right and left. I would read familiar messages — NO Vacancy, Mail, Wanted Houseboy: Apply Inside, Beware of Dog (or its variation which warns “Forget the Dog, Beware the Owner”), Post No Bill, Do Not Enter, Under Renovation, or Under New Management. I knew what the other signs meant, but I was curious what “new management” would look like. I would often wonder, “Is the new management grumpier and greedier or kinder and more generous than the old one?” Game changer
My first encounter with a Manager reminded me how small I was in the overall scheme of things, especially in the context of my position as messenger (with a lower case “m”). I didn’t know if that was how Managers at that time were taught to behave, but I noticed that most managers would almost always maintain a certain distance between them and their subordinates. Many were autocratic, spoke in measured manner and tone, and could not care less how demeaning they would often treat other people. Fortunately, in 1960, Douglas McGregor wrote a book that helped me change my outlook about management. He was a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1950s and 1960s, and his book was called, “The Human Side of Enterprise.” McGregor proposed that there are two alternative ways by which managers perceive and address employee motivation. According to McGregor, Theory X management assumes that people dislike work and will avoid it if they could; that people are not ambitious and would rather be directed; and that people are gullible, resist change, and should be coerced and controlled if you expect them to help achieve organizational goals. Conversely, Theory Y management assumes that people consider work as natural as play and rest, are responsible and, given the right conditions, will seek responsibility. People can be committed to achieve quality and productivity goals if the right rewards are in place. It was McGregor who first pointed out that a “command-and-control” environment is not effective. In early corporate America, “command-and-control” was the norm — thanks to retired Generals who were rewarded with corporate positions after World War 2. McGregor thought that the essence of “command-and-control” relies on lower needs for motivation, which are mostly satisfied already among the majority of employees. This theory was a corollary to Abraham Maslow’s “Hierarchy of Needs Theory.” When employees lose their motivation, they will tend to dislike their work, avoid responsibility, resist change, etc. That creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Change drivers
Among enlightened managers, McGregor’s simple concept was a game changer. Over the years, when the “profession” of management developed to its fullness in the 1980s and 1990s, a bunch of enlightened Theory Y managers created a critical mass that swayed the practice of management towards how we experience it today. Also, there are significant change drivers that forced the practice of management to change. First is technology. The management practice championed by Frederick Winslow Taylor during the First Industrial Revolution was based on the technology in the days of Henry Ford, who leveraged the production line for utmost efficiency. Today and in the future, the Internet of Things will have a tremendous impact on the way managers will relate with their subordinates. In fact, even the face of management is now changing. In some cases, and where robotics and artificial intelligence have fully set into workplace processes, subordinates are already taking orders from C-3PO (the speaking, walking humanoid robot in “Star Wars”). Lest human managers and supervisors become irrelevant, they must be tech savvy now and in the future. To stay relevant, managers must have empathy and compassion — something that robot supervisors still don’t have. Second is information. As information almost doubles every year, it has become a most important global resource. Managers must have information at their fingertips in order to manage effectively. Enough said! The third is the changing demographics. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of the workplace are between their 20s and 30s. The elderly managers must adjust their management style to make these workplace inhabitants tick. Enough said, too! Managing in the next normal
Management and leadership will continue to change, as the business of doing business changes. In the next normal, managers must be able to adapt to the changing environment or C-3PO will take their jobs. Here are some of the requisites for managing in the next normal: – Caring. The Covid-19 pandemic provided lessons that managers did not learn in Management 101. Henceforth, managers are expected to be deeply concerned about employees’ safety, health and overall well-being. People expect to work in a safe environment that offers them not just ample pay and benefits, but a sense of belonging, social contact and a semblance of normalcy. – Character and integrity. Employees prefer to work with managers who share the same values with them. Managers must live and demonstrate in no uncertain terms the Company’s mission and values, in a way that people can feel and empathize with. While being transparent with organizational and environmental realities, managers must exude optimism and hope, inspire, and motivate their people. – Competence. Skills are the new currency of the future. Emerging managerial roles require an elaborate mix of hard and soft skills. While intelligence quotient (IQ) remains constant, emotional quotient (EQ) can be developed and improved over time. EQ and adversity quotient (AQ) are among the soft skills that will help managers succeed when the going gets tougher. Managers must indulge in intentional lifelong learning in order to stay sharp, smart, and relevant. – Crisis-proofing. Businesses, brands and people that survive during crises are generally purpose-driven. Revisit your purpose; find a niche that is aligned with your purpose. Managers must develop resilient strategies for business continuity and sustainability. In like manner, they should develop even more creative strategies for career continuity and sustainability. Amid the growing uncertainty, managers must learn to adapt to the neck-breaking speed at which changes in the global environment occur. In a recent online management and leadership forum, I told managers to “[c]hallenge your current assumptions about management and leadership in the next normal. When the smoke clears, we could be seeing a different landscape in the workplace that will require a different set of managerial and leadership skills. Upskill and reskill to be relevant.” Obviously, there are new and emerging dimensions in management that were different from what Taylor, Ford, McGregor and Maslow saw during their time. This is the time for “new management” in uncertain times. Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, said, “There are four ingredients in true leadership: brains, soul, heart and good nerves.” The whole world is still in deep trouble. Perhaps, it should be “Under New Management.” Ernie Cecilia is the chairman of the Human Capital Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (AMCHAM); Co-Chairman of the Employers Confederation of the Philippines’ (ECOP’s) TWG on Labor Policy and Social Issues; and past president of the People Management Association of the Philippines (PMAP).

https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/25/campus-press/human-dynamics-in-the-new-normal/844964/,Human dynamics in the new normal,Teresita Tanhueco-Tumapon,2021-02-25 00:00:00,"We are constantly invited to be what we are. – Henry David Thoreau DOES this pandemic call for our shaping a new behavioral pattern, given this new normal? Humankind has been the subject of much research. Studies on human dynamics have caused many hours of thoughtful observations and reflections to draw out what these differences are among us humans. These differences underpin our manner of thinking, feeling and acting. These differences, salient and latent, lie beneath, much like what is below an iceberg, Understanding human dynamics. Our understanding of life, our dealing with relationships, how we perform our responsibilities, face problems, make decisions and choose and implement solutions — all these are influenced by an innate system in each of us. This system impacts on how we think, feel and act. Thus, there are these differences among identical twins, family members, teachers, students and among people within our respective organizations or communities with whom we work. Unless we are aware of our respective differences, we cannot avoid misunderstandings and thus fail in our relationships. For us teachers, we would likely have some unproductive teaching due to our approaches not matching our students’ learning processes. This situation results in minimized learning of our students or worse, in their dropping out from our classes or from the school. The same is true to child rearing or parenting. This explains why children at times become rebellious or would feel unloved, harboring ill feelings up to adult age because we parents fail to understand what anchors their manner of thinking, feeling and acting. Leaders who know the mental framework of their constituents, would be able “to utilize their own and that of their constituents’ distinctive processes and capacities to achieve optimal individual and group performance.” Otherwise, employees become unproductive. Employees would execute work haphazardly because of their leader whose manner of speech and action leaves much to strain relationships. What is human dynamics? Human dynamics is a doctoral subject for students with a major in human resource management or in leadership and organization. Human Dynamics is apt and necessary, especially for leaders and office heads, to understand the human systems that constitute their respective organizations. Understanding human dynamics would have leaders know what continuing professional development is appropriate for employees to recognize, appreciate, and optimally utilize their diverse capacities, and work together harmoniously and productively. Human dynamics would enlighten students by what scholars have drawn from their studies — the inner differences that influence how “people think, plan and learn; experience emotions; communicate and relate with others; and go about engaging in activities and projects.” (www.humandynamics.com › who-we-are) These latent differences are true to “everyone, regardless of age, gender, culture, country or race.” Human dynamics research. Studies refer to three human system principles: the mental, emotional and physical principles. These principles work in tandem as people relate to one another. These are distinctive pathways to living our lives which flourish and contribute best under certain conditions and which could be developed, given we are aware of them. “The mental principle…is related to the mind — to thinking, values, structure, focus, objectivity, and perspective. The more subjective emotional principle concerns relationships — such as communication, connection, organization, empathy, harmony and “putting things together in new ways (creativity).” (https://thesystems.com/human-dynamics-for-the-21st-century/) A person with a well-developed emotional principle “is aware of his or her own feelings without being dominated by them and expresses those feelings appropriately.” The creative imagination, which accesses the inner life and makes connections in new ways, is also an expression of the emotional principle, which results in creativity. The “physical principle covers the process of “doing, making, producing, concretizing, detailing, making operational, utilizing, ensuring practicality, cooperating, synthesizing and systematizing,” operations. (https://dritter55.wordpress.com/2008/0709/a-brief-review-of-human-dynamics/) Human dynamics and new normal issues. Studies show that individuals function well when mental, emotional and physical principles are “developed and integrated.” But “when one or more principles are underdeveloped, a lack of wholeness and relative ineffectiveness exists in certain areas of a person’s life.” (https://dritter55.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/a-brief-review-of-human-dynamics/) “Whereas the mental principle is associated with the mind and thinking, and the emotional principle, with feelings and relating, the physical principle is aligned with the body and the translation into action of what is thought and felt.” (https://dritter55.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/a-brief-review-of-human-dynamics/) Drawing from these principles, how do they impact on the adaptiveness and preparedness of societies to the hazards of the pandemic? “The understanding of the dynamics which unfold during and in the direct aftermath of a pandemic are key to effective and efficient management decisions.” (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11299-020-00256-y) Human dynamics: impact on Covid-19 interventions. An analysis how the interventions adopted by different countries were influenced by the human dynamics of their respective governments — the people involved in coming out with these choices — would render us lessons. As Simon, et al. (1990; Gaissmaier & Gigerenzer, 2012) wrote, human dynamics that anchored their long term perspectives are likely to be shaped by two factors — the individual mind and the structure of the environment. “The former is affected by the perception of the Covid-19 pandemic as a dread risk with changes in behavioral patterns lurking” (Gigerenzer, 2004).“The latter also affects individual behavior as it determines the boundaries for adaptivity.” (Simon, 1990). “The structure of the environment is, amongst others, shaped by policy decisions.” Given the environment and the mindsets of our decision makers, we hope interventions adopted to ease our lives in this pandemic could have “a long-term perspective.” This “might help minimize unwanted (and often delayed) effects.” Error!

The long-anticipated shot could offer the nation a third vaccine option and help speed vaccinations by requiring just one dose instead of two. Food and Drug Administration scientists confirmed that overall the vaccine is about 66 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, and about 85 percent effective against the most serious illness. The agency also said J&J’s shot is safe. The analysis is just one step in the FDA’s evaluation. On Friday, the agency’s independent advisers will debate if the evidence is strong enough to recommend the shot. With that advice, the FDA is expected to make a final decision within days. The Covid-19 death toll in the US topped 500,000 this week, and the vaccination drive has been slower than hoped, hampered by logistical and weather delays. So far, about 44.5 million Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine made by Pfizer or Moderna, and nearly 20 million of them have received the second dose required for full protection. Tests showed the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were 95 percent effective at protection against symptomatic Covid-19. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, is part of the FDA advisory panel that will scrutinize the J&J data on Friday and cautions that none of the vaccines have been directly compared. Still, he was encouraged that one dose of the J&J vaccine appears as good at preventing serious illness as its two-dose competitors. “This is a vaccine to prevent you from going to the hospital and dying at a level that’s certainly comparable” to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, he said. J&J tested its single-dose option in 44,000 adults in the US, Latin America and South Africa. Different mutated versions of the virus are circulating in different countries, and the FDA analysis cautioned that it’s not clear how well the vaccine works against each variant. But J&J previously announced that the vaccine worked better in the US — 72 percent effective against moderate to severe Covid-19, compared with 66 percent in Latin America and 57 percent in South Africa. South Africa recently began giving the J&J vaccine to front-line health workers on a test basis after deciding that a vaccine from rival AstraZeneca had not shown strong enough study results against the particularly concerning variant spreading there. “I was reassured” that despite different variants, the J&J shot still protected against serious illness, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. “That’s pretty robust data.” In case the vaccines eventually need to be updated, manufacturers are working on adjustments to their recipes. Moderna announced Wednesday that it is ready to begin testing experimental doses that better match the South African version of the virus. Across all countries, the analysis of the J&J vaccine showed protection began to emerge about 14 days after vaccination. But by 28 days after vaccination, there were no hospitalizations or deaths in the vaccinated group compared with 16 hospitalizations and seven deaths in study recipients who received a dummy shot. This Dec. 2, 2020 photo provided by Johnson & Johnson shows vials of the Janssen Covid19 vaccine in the United States. Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine protects against COVID-19, according to an analysis by US regulators Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021, that sets the stage for a final decision on a new and easier-to-use shot to help tame the pandemic. PHOTO BY JOHNSON & JOHNSON VIA AP The FDA said effectiveness and safety were consistent across racial groups, including Black and Latino participants. All of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines have been tested differently, making comparisons nearly impossible. It would not be surprising if one dose turned out to be a little weaker than two doses, and policymakers will decide if that’s an acceptable trade-off to get more people vaccinated faster. J&J has another large study underway to see if a second dose of its vaccine works better, raising the prospect that countries could eventually add a booster if one turned out to be warranted. Like other Covid-19 vaccines, the main side effects of the J&J shot are pain at the injection site and flu-like fever, fatigue and headache. No study participant experienced the severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, that is a rare risk of some other Covid-19 shots, although one experienced a less serious reaction. The FDA said there were no serious side effects linked to the vaccine so far, although it recommended further monitoring for blood clots. In the study, those were reported in about 15 vaccine recipients and 10 placebo recipients, not enough of a difference to tell if the vaccine played any role. J&J was on track to become the world’s first one-dose option until earlier this month. Mexico announced it would use a one-dose version from China’s CanSino, which is made with similar technology as J&J’s shot but initially was developed as a two-dose option until beginning a one-dose test in the fall. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines now being used in the US and numerous other countries must be kept frozen, while the J&J shot can last three months in a refrigerator, making it easier to handle. AstraZeneca’s vaccine — widely used in Europe and Britain — is made similarly and also requires refrigeration but takes two doses. If the FDA clears the J&J shot for US use, it will not boost vaccine supplies significantly right away. Only a few million doses are expected to be ready for shipping in the first week. But J&J told Congress this week that it expected to provide 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million by summer. European regulators and the World Health Organization also are considering J&J’s vaccine. Worldwide, the company aims to produce around a billion doses by the end of the year. ",Manila Times

The patient, Gabriella Forgione, wasn’t complaining. The 25-year-old pharmacy worker was happy to be prodded and poked at the hospital in Nice, in southern France, to advance her increasingly pressing quest to recover her sense of smell. Along with her sense of taste, it suddenly vanished when she fell ill with Covid-19 in November, and neither has returned. Being deprived of the pleasures of food and the scents of things that she loves are proving tough on her body and mind. Shorn of odors both good and bad, Forgione is losing weight and self-confidence. “Sometimes I ask myself, ‘Do I stink?'” she confessed. “Normally, I wear perfume and like for things to smell nice. Not being able to smell bothers me greatly.” A year into the coronavirus pandemic, doctors and researchers are still striving to better understand and treat the accompanying epidemic of Covid-19-related anosmia — loss of smell — draining much of the joy of life from an increasing number of sensorially frustrated longer-term sufferers like Forgione. Gabriella Forgione, a 25-year-old patient, holds still as a doctor slides a miniature camera up her nose during tests in a hospital in Nice, France on Monday, Feb. 8, 2021, to help determine why she has been unable to smell or taste since she contracted Covid-19 in November 2020. AP PHOTO Even specialist doctors say there is much about the condition they still don’t know and they are learning as they go along in their diagnoses and treatments. Impairment and alteration of smell have become so common with Covid-19 that some researchers suggest that simple odor tests could be used to track coronavirus infections in countries with few laboratories. For most people, the olfactory problems are temporary, often improving on their own in weeks. But a small minority are complaining of persistent dysfunction long after other Covid-19 symptoms have disappeared. Some have reported continued total or partial loss of smell six months after infection. The longest, some doctors say, are now approaching a full year. Researchers working on the vexing disability say they are optimistic that most will eventually recover but fear some will not. Some doctors are concerned that growing numbers of smell-deprived patients, many of them young, could be more prone to depression and other difficulties and weigh on strained health systems. “They are losing color in their lives,” said Dr. Thomas Hummel, who heads the smell and taste outpatients clinic at University Hospital in Dresden, Germany. “These people will survive and they’ll be successful in their lives, in their professions,” Hummel added. “But their lives will be much poorer.” At the Face and Neck University Institute in Nice, Dr. Clair Vandersteen wafted tube after tube of odors under Forgione’s nose after he had rooted around in her nostrils with his camera. “Do you perceive any smell? Nothing? Zero? OK,” he asked, as she repeatedly and apologetically responded with negatives. Only the last tube provoked an unequivocal reaction. “Urgh! Oh, that stinks,” Forgione yelped. “Fish!” Test complete, Vandersteen delivered his diagnosis. “You need an enormous amount of an odor to be able to smell something,” he told her. “You haven’t completely lost your sense of smell but nor is it good.” The hand of Dr. Clair Vandersteen wafts a tube of odors under the nose of a blindfolded patient, Gabriella Forgione, during tests in a hospital in Nice, southern France, Monday, Feb. 8, 2021. AP PHOTO He sent her away with homework: six months of olfactory rehab. Twice daily, choose two or three scented things, like a sprig of lavender or jars of fragrances, and smell them for two to three minutes, he ordered. “If you smell something, great. If not, no problem. Try again, concentrating hard on picturing the lavender, a beautiful purple bloom,” he said. “You have to persevere.” Losing the sense of smell can be more than a mere inconvenience. Smoke from a spreading fire, a gas leak, or the stink of rotten food can all pass dangerously unnoticed. Fumes from a used diaper, dog’s dirt on a shoe or sweaty armpits can be embarrassingly ignored. And as poets have long known, scents and emotions are often like lovers entwined. Evan Cesa used to relish meal times. Now they’re a chore. A fish dinner in September that suddenly seemed flavorless first flagged to the 18-year-old sports student that COVID-19 had attacked his senses. Foodstuffs became mere textures, with only residual hints of sweet and saltiness. Five months later, breakfasting on chocolate cookies before classes, Cesa still chewed without joy, as though swallowing cardboard. “Eating no longer has any purpose for me,” he said. “It is just a waste of time.” Cesa is among the anosmia sufferers being studied by researchers in Nice who, before the pandemic, had been using scents in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. They also used comforting fragrances to treat post-traumatic stress among children after a truck terror attack in Nice in 2016, when a driver plowed through holiday crowds, killing 86 people. Dr. Clair Vandersteen (right) wafts a tube of odors under the nose of a patient, Gabriella Forgione. AP PHOTO The researchers are now turning their expertise to Covid-19, teaming up with perfumers from the nearby fragrance-producing town of Grasse. Perfumer Aude Galouye worked on the fragrant waxes that were wafted under Cesa’s nose to measure his olfactory impairment, with scents at varying concentrations. “The sense of smell is a sense that is fundamentally forgotten,” Galouye said. “We don’t realize the effect it has on our lives except, obviously, when we no longer have it.” The examinations on Cesa and other patients also include language and attention tests. The Nice researchers are exploring whether olfactory complaints are linked to Covid-related cognitive difficulties, including problems with concentrating. Cesa stumbled by picking the word “ship” when “kayak” was the obvious choice on one test. “That is completely unexpected,” said Magali Payne, a speech therapist on the team. “This young man shouldn’t be experiencing linguistic problems.” “We have to keep digging,” she said. “We are finding things out as we see patients.” Cesa longs to have his senses restored, to celebrate the taste of pasta in carbonara sauce, his favorite dish, and a run through the fragrant wonders of the great outdoors. “One might think that it is not important to be able to smell nature, trees, forests,” he said. “But when you lose the sense of smell, you realize how truly lucky we are to be able to smell these things.”",Manila Times

Gonzales,2021-02-22 00:00:00,"A think tank suggested expanding the coverage of amusement taxes that local government units (LGUs) can impose to include streaming shows as they look for other means to increase their sources of revenues amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a report over the weekend, the National Tax Research Center (NTRC) said local governments need more of these sources to finance their various programs and continue serving their constituents as the Covid-19 crisis persisted. It suggested broadening the scope of the local amusement tax as a way to boost earnings, as “LGUs should not only rely on the fiscal support and allocations from the national government.” Revenue collections from amusement taxes may be insignificant compared to others, but these still contribute to state coffers, the think tank emphasized. Local and national amusement taxes collected reached P887.72 million and P134.50 million, respectively, from 2014 to 2018, according to the report. The cancellation of several entertainment events on account of the pandemic resulted in lower revenues in the Greater Manila Area, where almost half of these came from. The government banned them at the onset of the pandemic, as they encourage mass gatherings that would allow the coronavirus to spread. The estimated revenue loss from taxes collected from SM Prime Holdings Inc. — which operates the Sy Group’s shopping malls, as well as cinemas — alone amounted to P376.39 million at end-September 2020. “As it stands and as construed by the Supreme Court in various cases, Section 140 of the LGC (Local Government Code) of 1991, as amended, is limited only to theaters, cinemas, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement where one seeks admission to entertain oneself by seeing or viewing the show or performance,” the report said. “In this regard, the coverage of local amusement tax may be broadened to include places that may be considered as places of amusement. In addition, the phrase ‘places of amusement’ must be defined appropriately so as to include other establishments that may be considered as such,” it added. While the pandemic suspended or canceled most shows and programs, there are online streaming shows that can be regarded as sources of amusement, according to the NTRC, noting that people are watching them at home amid the state-imposed mobility restrictions. “The LGUs can tap these sites as sources of tax revenues as the country [adapts to] the new normal,” it said. “LGUs need a broader range of revenue tools. These should include revenue sources that automatically grow with the economy, and at present live streaming may be closely considered as an additional revenue source of LGUs,” the think tank added. “However, it is crucial that social and economic issues are taken into consideration so that new funding sources shift costs fairly on those who can most afford to pay.” The administrative aspect of imposing this tax should also be considered, according to the NTRC. “Congress should consider reviewing the LGC of 1991, as amended, to align the limitations and taxing powers of LGUs to modern business models. For instance, expanding the coverage of local amusement tax may be explored by policymakers to provide additional revenue to LGUs,” it said. “Expanding the local amusement tax coverage will give sufficient leeway for the local sanggunian (council) to explore other activities that may be covered by the local amusement tax,” it added.",Manila Times

Of course, it is always better to be prepared. As Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” But with delay after delay in the arrival, the dry runs are becoming less virtuous and more comedic. A Manila health worker shows how to aspire a Covid-19 vaccine from a mock vial, during a mass vaccination simulation activity for senior citizens inside the Legarda Elementary School in Sampaloc, Manila, on 18 February 2021. PHOTO BY MIKE ALQUINTO Indeed, the latest from the Palace is that even President Rodrigo Duterte has grown impatient with the delays. That should have been reassuring, until we remember that he heads the government that is on the receiving end of the blame. Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine from the Covax Facility were supposed to arrive by mid-February, but delivery was snagged because of vague issues surrounding the indemnity agreement. Also, the 600,000 doses of China’s Sinovac Biotech vaccine expected to arrive on February 23 may also be delayed because the manufacturer has yet to secure emergency use authorization from the local Food and Drug Administration. With frustration growing, the government now has to parry more criticisms than usual. Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo, along with other government critics like Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros, pointed out that even less developed countries like Bangladesh have started inoculations. The observation may be factual but perhaps out of context. Such statements only add to the absurd play and are helpful only in scoring cheap political points. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered a broader perspective on the matter. He said he was alarmed by the global disparity of vaccine distribution. He pointed out that 130 countries have yet to receive vaccines, and that only 10 nations have administered 75 percent of the doses available. Guterres also appealed to the Group of 20 or G20 to bear more of the responsibility for financing and implementing vaccination programs around the world, saying the UN will provide them its full support. “If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in the Global South, it will mutate again and again. New variants could become more transmissible, more deadly and, potentially, threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines and diagnostics,” he explained in a story by Agence France-Presse. “This can prolong the pandemic significantly, enabling the virus to come back to plague the Global North.” Those fears are proving to be prophetic. Just on Saturday, The Manila Times reported that two new Covid-19 variants were discovered in Central Visayas. Health experts are still studying these variants, but mutations found elsewhere in the world seem to be more transmissible and virulent, possibly even resistant to the vaccines now being distributed. Consequences of delays Besides more people falling ill or dying, the delays in vaccination will likely spawn black markets and encourage criminal activities. That may already be happening, and if this is true, the situation becomes more complicated for the Duterte government. A few months ago, when media uncovered that the President’s security detail received Covid-19 shots that were smuggled into the country, there were also reports that thousands of Chinese expatriates and Chinese Filipinos had been vaccinated somehow. As we mentioned before in this space, a local black market for vaccines may have already emerged. With people desperate for protection from the pandemic and with the country eager to restart the economy, more may become susceptible to all sorts of schemes. Getting authentic vaccines through unlawful means is one thing, but what if people are duped into paying for fake shots or being injected with placebos? Can buyers tell whether they are getting a flu shot instead of a tested Covid-19 vaccine? Sadly, this issue subsided when President Duterte himself objected to an investigation of the Presidential Security Group (PSG). For the sake of protecting the PSG, there was no directive to look into the vaccine black market. That is yet another act in this unfolding horseplay. The public is distracted by the illusion of movement from simulations, but there is hardly any action. The government needs to get its act together somehow, despite the global issues. More than anything else, that would help bring down the curtains on this tiresome tragedy.",Manila Times

According to Dr. Cynthia Saloma, University of the Philippines-Philippine Genome Center (UP-PGC) director, the E484K and the N501Y mutations were detected in 31 out the 70 samples that came from the region during the sequencing made by the center on February 11. “These are mutations of global concern that were exhibited by variants of concern tulad ng nasa (like in) South Africa, yung sa Brazil and yung sa United Kingdom,” Saloma said in a press conference on Friday. Saloma said the “silent” mutation of the SARS-CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus 2) virus was brought about by changes in the sequence of its deoxyribonucleic or ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA) pairs, and can either cause a loss, gain in function or possibly no change at all. The variants are considered viruses that developed from a specific group of mutations, causing them to behave differently from the strain they originated from. Both mutations can either increase the transmission of Covid-19 and reduce the efficacy of the current vaccines in use, according to Saloma. The cases with these mutations had only exhibited mild symptoms and were cleared. Saloma added that the PGC Genomic Biosurveillance team and the DoH epidemiology bureau will now closely check the genome sequences of the samples and monitor the cases that had been infected with these mutations. Despite the discovery of the new mutations in Central Visayas, Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd said that this may not affect Metro Manila’s planned shift to modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) by March 1 as long as the region is careful in enforcing a more relaxed status. “We have to scale up even more in the light of these variants… our massive promotion to let the public comply with all of our minimum public health standards, and the aggressive early detection by way of testing, tracing and isolation,” Duque said.",Manila Times
https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/19/opinion/columnists/secure-and-insecure-citizenship/842604/,Secure and insecure citizenship,Stephen CuUnjieng,2021-02-19 00:00:00,"I WAS debating whether to write another article on Covid-19 having first read a very intelligent article in The Atlantic and given the misinformation being peddled by others. There are those who for their personal reasons have an ideological bias that overcomes fact and reason, but I decided against another article that would marginally be bringing up new points given all the major ones that have already been set forth. Maybe if it was substantially on points not previously raised or new verified information rather than rehashing whatever one’s bias dictates and quoting prejudiced sources. On the topic, I am not discussing what is the way we should apply our citizenship laws. While I did work at the Romulo Law Office and passed the bar, my legal career ended in 1984, and I do not pretend to be up to date or remember enough of what I was ably taught decades ago. This is about our attitude toward citizenship and contrast that with others. Many may take issue with my observations, but that is what reasoned discourse is about. I have observed that generally, the more secure a country is, the more liberal their citizenship laws. The less differences in citizenship rights between natural and naturalized, the more open-minded their attitude toward citizenship is. Same is true on how straightforward and open the country is to naturalization. An exception to this is Japan, where like the Philippines one only gets citizenship through jus sanguinis (bloodline — so a parent must be a citizen to bestow citizenship on a child) vs jus soli (where you are born). Places like the US and UK give both jus sanguinis and soli. In Japan you have people who legally work and stay there for generations but because of bloodline never become citizens. That would be the case here as well unless you opt for naturalization. Ironically, it often seems the stricter the citizenship laws, the less desirable the country often is for citizenship anyway. These tend to be the jus sanguinis only countries. Jus soli or jus sanguinis
Why do countries like the US (though the nativist and racist Trump talked about changing it and fortunately his losing ends that immediate fear) apply jus soli? Why do they grant citizenship if you were born there and have for immigrants a relatively straightforward path to citizenship? First, these tend to be countries that had high immigration in their formative years and encouraged it (though the US also has swung the other way under Trump and had its shameful racist periods like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Japanese incarceration in times of backlash and xenophobia). Second, they tend to be successful and secure countries that argue if you stay here it is because you want to and believe it, to use the popular phrase, to be “the land of opportunity.” Let us not digress into talk among elites who argue about their privileges and so on here vs there. I am talking about opportunity in spite of challenges overall. Those countries are generally not worried that you are going there to exploit the country. You are going there to be part of it. You have bought into their narrative or at least believe that for all the challenges, the opportunities there are better than back home. My one digression that really gets me angry is when people tout the Philippines as paradise because you can have maids and personal help en masse. Guess what? Maybe it is paradise for those who have maids. It is far from paradise for the ones rendering the service. To many and I agree, it is a sign of advancement and civilization that there are enough opportunities in a country that many do not have to be domestic help and if they do so, are compensated enough so it is at least partially a choice rather than something one does for lack of choice or to survive. A paradise is one that is paradise for all or most. Not some tiny sliver only. When my family and I lived in the US, we had no live-in or full-time help. If you needed or wanted someone to come in to clean the house or mow the lawn you contracted with a service, and they would come over, often as a team and do what they needed to in a few hours and then would come back depending on your schedule weekly or as one needed or scheduled. In New York City, it is often an individual rather than a team given most have apartments. Also, the society is structured so you do not need live-in or permanent help to have a comfortable life. The only exception is if you have very young children; then the need to arrange reliable baby-sitters is a chore and can be a challenge. Hence one often sees parents bringing their infants with them to restaurants, cinemas and the like. Related to this is the comment I often hear which is, why do Filipinos do well when abroad? I think it is in large part that our country, 75 years after independence, has not delivered for its ever-increasing population. In our region, Malaysia and Thailand have and Vietnam is clearly on its way to doing so. I remember being so proud after 1986 and so sad for China after 1989. Let us be blunt, absent surface political rights (and I say surface and superficial because who really benefits and can make use of our democratic rights), who is better off if we take conditions prevailing in 1990 as the starting point? On both an individual and country level — the Philippines or China? The answer except for political dissidents is so sadly and blatantly obvious. To go back to the question, why do Filipinos do well abroad while the country underperforms? I used to say, the biggest vote in the Philippines is not the vote for this or that candidate. It is the vote to leave, which tens of millions of Filipinos have taken and continue to take. In my view, Filipinos do well abroad for two reasons — simply because they are incentivized to do so and generally those who go abroad are the more aggressive and adventurous ones. Let us assume you are in a middle position, not happy but not unhappy. Which type of person chooses to stay and which chooses to try something different elsewhere? Who is willing to be away from their families, friends, comfort zone and environment? The latter might not be smarter or wiser and it may be the wrong decision, but that person is definitely more adventurous and open to new ideas and challenges. Guess what? That is what they say in other countries as well, where there is a diaspora until the home country becomes successful and many return home. Natural-born vs naturalized
An offshoot of this is the different rights of natural-born and naturalized citizens. In the US, I think the only differentiator I know is that only a natural-born citizen can be president and if there was fraud in the naturalization process, citizenship can be rescinded. A natural-born citizen cannot have this citizenship removed or revoked. The US requires certain industries like media and transportation and their CEOs to be American. They do not distinguish between natural and naturalized. When he bought the New York Post decades ago, Rupert Murdoch acquired American citizenship to enable himself to be a publisher. Same thing with elected and appointed government officials below president. There was even some fringe speculation during Watergate after VP Agnew resigned that Nixon appointed Kissinger who was a naturalized citizen as vice president as he could not run for and be elected president but if Nixon resigned, he could become president. Don’t know if that view was accurate and many who detest Kissinger would have been aghast if it had happened, but it did not come to pass. Yet some writers speculated on it. Dual citizens
This is another thing secure countries are relaxed about. Mark Carney was the governor of the Central Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013. Having done an exemplary job and being a dual citizen of Canada and the United Kingdom, he was then made governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. Economist Stanley Fischer, who was born in what is now Zambia (the former Northern Rhodesia) has dual citizenship — Israeli and American. He was chief economist of the World Bank, then from 2005 to 2013 was governor of the Bank of Israel. In 2014, President Obama appointed him vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He stepped down for personal reasons in 2017. Jennifer Granholm is both a Canadian and naturalized American citizen and was born in Canada. She was elected and served as governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011 and has now been appointed secretary of energy by President Biden. What is my point behind these examples? The US, the UK, Canada and Israel did not care if they were dual citizens or naturalized. They just wanted the best and most qualified citizens. Why exclude citizens based on having more than one citizenship or being naturalized? I would suggest in a country like ours, where so many left for opportunity and necessity, why discriminate against them if they want to engage in public service when they return? Recovery of citizenship was a good step but why be so insecure and stop there? The same for naturalized citizens. You must really want to be part of the country if you take an actual step of taking citizenship. If one argues but they left or they got naturalized for opportunistic reasons, my answer is so what? If they are lousy or disloyal, then remove them or vote them out. Are we that insecure? Or jealous?",Manila Times

The UN chief told a high-level meeting of the UN Security Council that 130 countries have not received a single dose of vaccine and declared that “at this critical moment, vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community.” Guterres called for an urgent Global Vaccination Plan to bring together those with the power to ensure fair vaccine distribution — scientists, vaccine producers and those who can fund the effort. The secretary-general called on the world’s major economic powers in the Group of 20 to establish an emergency task force to establish a plan and coordinate its implementation and financing. He said the task force should have the capacity “to mobilize the pharmaceutical companies and key industry and logistics actors.” Guterres said Friday’s meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations “can create the momentum to mobilize the necessary financial resources.” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, whose country holds the Security Council presidency this month, urged the UN’s most powerful body to adopt a resolution calling for ceasefires in conflict zones to allow the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines. Thirteen ministers were scheduled to address the meeting on improving access to Covid-19 including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Britain says more than 160 million people are at risk of being excluded from coronavirus vaccinations because they live in countries engulfed in conflict and instability, including Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia. “Global vaccination coverage is essential to beating coronavirus,” Raab said ahead of the meeting. “That is why the UK is calling for a vaccination cease-fire to allow Covid-19 vaccines to reach people living in conflict zones and for a greater global team effort to deliver equitable access.” Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward said: “Humanitarian organizations and UN agencies need the full backing of the council to be able to carry out the job we are asking them to do.” Woodward said cease-fires have been used to carry out vaccinations, pointing to a two-day pause in fighting in Afghanistan in 2001 that enabled 35,000 health workers and volunteers to vaccinate 5.7 million children under the age of 5 against polio. Britain has drafted a Security Council resolution that Woodward said the UK hopes will be adopted in the coming weeks. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Tuesday that Mexico will stress the importance of equal access for all countries to Covid-19 vaccines at the council meeting. He was sharply critical that countries that produce the vaccine have high vaccination rates while Latin American countries have problems obtaining any vaccines. The coronavirus has infected more than 109 million people and killed at least 2.4 million of them. But many countries have not yet started vaccination programs and even rich nations are facing shortages of vaccine doses as manufacturers struggle to ramp up production. The World Health Organization’s COVAX program, an ambitious project to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world’s poorest people, has already missed its own goal of beginning coronavirus vaccinations in poor countries at the same time that shots were rolled out in rich countries. Numerous developing countries have rushed in recent weeks to sign their own private deals to buy vaccines, unwilling to wait for COVAX. Woodward said Britain supports reserving 5% of COVAX doses as a “last resort” buffer to ensure that high-risk populations have access to Covid-19 vaccines.",Manila Times
https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/18/campus-press/are-supervisors-still-relevant-in-the-next-normal/842225/,Are supervisors still relevant in the next normal?,"Ernie Cecilia, DPM",2021-02-18 00:00:00,"Almost a year ago, Josh Dzieza, investigations editor and feature writer at “The Verge,” wrote an article that could scare today’s Supervisors. The handwriting on the wall looks clear, “In warehouses, call centers and other sectors, intelligent machines are managing humans, and they’re making work more stressful, grueling, and dangerous.” Robo-bosses
Dzieza continues, “The robots are watching over hotel housekeepers, telling them which room to clean and tracking how quickly they do it. They’re managing software developers, monitoring their clicks and scrolls and docking their pay if they work too slowly. They’re listening to call center workers, telling them what to say, how to say it, and keeping them constantly, maximally busy. While we’ve been watching the horizon for the self-driving trucks, perpetually five years away, the robots arrived in the form of the supervisor, the foreman, the middle manager.” Robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) have arrived, and workers in many countries are worried. Dzieza said, “For many of them, their greatest fear isn’t that robots might come for their jobs: it’s that robots have already become their boss.” While many employees detest the thought of being supervised by a robot, a recent survey by Kevin Kruse, CEO of LEADx, revealed that more than 20 percent of workers would want to replace their boss with a generic robot. The LEADx survey results could be unsettling for some supervisors, considering that supervisors have come a long way since the medieval times and have been permanent fixtures in today’s workplace. Origin of supervisor
According to Wikipedia, the word “supervisor” came from the Medieval Latin verb “supervidēre,” meaning “to oversee.” The prefix super (also supra) means “over” or “above”, while the Latin vidēre means “to see.” Literally, to supervise means to see from above. The supervisor is also known by several names — foreman, boss, overseer, monitor, area coordinator or sometimes “gaffer.” In the factory, the supervisor is in a low-level management position. In the academe, the supervisor could be one of the most senior in the staff, such as a Professor who oversees a PhD dissertation. Sometimes, people in the same job grade as the Supervisor are also classified as supervisors, even if they do not supervise other people. Supervisors’ dilemma
Perhaps, supervisors are one of the most misunderstood and stressed people in the workplace. They have productivity-conscious bosses above them and sometimes uncooperative subordinates below them. They’re like the “bibingka,” the Filipino rice cake cooked with fire under it and burning coal on top of it. The first time I was promoted to be a supervisor came as a surprise. I had no training to be one. It seemed that my boss perceived how good I was at doing my clerical tasks. As a reward, I was promoted! Then my headaches began. Here’s why: Like I said, I never had any supervisory skills training before I got promoted. It felt like I was thrown into the pool, and I heard my boss shouting, “Swim!” I was good at technical work, but I never did management or supervisory work. The scope of my job was unclear at first. My friends and fellow employees suddenly became my subordinates. I was not sure if they were ready to accept me as their boss. My sense sometimes told me that some, not all, resented my promotion since many of them had more seniority and longevity in the company. Suddenly, I had two jobs — doing my own and minding the jobs of others. Somehow, I thought that I was programmed to be a rank and file. I had to reprogram my thinking and thought process to be like a manager. It was tough without support from my Manager. To those supervisors who now experience the same dilemma I encountered early in my career, here are some suggestions you might find useful: – Role clarification. First understand your new role — including what you’re supposed to do and what you’re not supposed to do. Ask your boss about his/her expectations and the limits of your authority. Once you’re clear on the parameters with your boss, clarify the same with your subordinates. Whenever possible, take time to discuss this with your subordinates as a group and on a one-on-one basis. Listen to their reactions — verbal and nonverbal — and to what is not being said. – Remain professional at all times. As a new “boss,” you need to establish professional working relationships with your bosses, peers and subordinates. Focus on issues and the tasks at hand, rather than on personalities. Do not shoot the messenger who brings you unsavory news. Be seen as a leader and enabler of others – not bossy, not pushing too hard. – Refrain from office politics. At all cost, avoid corridor or water-cooler politics. Do not side with one party to a dispute that you must arbitrate. Remain neutral, objective and fair always. Don’t get tempted to listen to juicy gossip, lest one day you’re subject of it, too. – Raise your managerial skills. Always sharpen your saw, as Covey said. While the management principles hardly change, the practice is influenced by a number of change drivers in business and in life. Continue to be a student of the art and science of management. Learn the science and adapt it to your working environment. C-3PO as boss?
First-time supervisors must not be wary about lack of supervisory, managerial or leadership skills. They are easily learned from the right sources. What is more worrisome is the development in technology that enables the machines to take over the supervisors’ jobs. The other aspect to worry about is the reaction of workers to the idea of changing a human supervisor with a robot. The younger employees are more willing and ready to trade their current boss with C-3PO. Many employees join a company. But Gallup says employees resign from their bosses. The Gallup survey speaks volumes. Bad bosses are perhaps the major reason for low employee engagement. The LEADx survey says that roughly 30 percent of employees would replace their boss with a friendly humanoid robot-like C-3PO. Recent employee engagement surveys confirm that 30 percent of employees worldwide are disengaged. Coincidence? The LEADx survey revealed the main reasons why employees would replace their bosses with robots: a) they don’t like their boss; 2) their boss is biased; 3) their boss lacks competence; and 4) their boss lacks people skills and empathy. The onus is on supervisors to prove that they are still relevant in the workplace now and in the future. Obviously, humans have characteristics that robots still don’t have, as we write. If the developers and programmers can find a way to program empathy, compassion and love into the DNA of the robots, the supervisors would be among the endangered species. The surveys tend to send a strong warning. People, especially the young, are willing to work with technology, especially in humanoid form, perhaps like Daryl (Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform) in the 1985 movie. People will prefer to have a robot boss if it means getting rid of their bad supervisor. To good supervisors, I say that there’s still a niche for you. As Brian Tracy said, “Only about two percent of people can work entirely without supervision. We call them Leaders.” To the employees, I reiterate my long-time admonition, “Take care of your boss now, the next could be worse — or not human.” Ernie Cecilia is the chairman of the Human Capital Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (AMCHAM); Co-Chairman of the Employers Confederation of the Philippines’ (ECOP’s) TWG on Labor Policy and Social Issues; and past president of the People Management Association of the Philippines (PMAP).

When the sun goes down, the stars will come out. – Anon THE pandemic has punctuated our equilibrium. Applied to various life areas such as in the disciplines — in physics, psychology, economics, management, etc., the term “equilibrium” means balance. Physics-wise, if the resultant of forces on opposite sides of the lever is zero, then there is equilibrium. This pandemic: A punctuated equilibrium. We are witnessing a punctuated equilibrium that has slammed aspects of life. Supply and demand such as for food and health out balance each other; unstable prices of such goods results. Psychology-wise, our mental schemata do not fit the actual environment we are in, be this in our cultural, physical or social environment. Our expectations based on the normal life we knew are incredibly incompatible with the new normal life the pandemic brought about. We need cognitive equilibrium to provide us an intellectual and emotional balance. The social distancing protocols and economic concerns caused by Covid-19 have imposed on us feelings of personal isolation and uncertainty. Obviously, to keep our sanity, we do need equilibrium. Punctuated equilibrium. As we try to calm our nerves in adjusting to this new normal, what can we do to redirect this seismic change? Let us draw understanding of this pandemic from the origin of what paleontologists identified as punctuated equilibrium (PE). The data base explains that there were five PE’s in the last 500 million years. It was a huge meteor or volcanic fury or both, as earth history explains, that caused the ecosystem to change drastically causing the dinosaurs to die. There were a few cold-blooded reptile survivors including crocodiles, but the new ecosystem favored the warm-blooded mammals. Why, because they were able to adapt to the severe weather changes. The PE theory “brings about change,” “after long periods of stability in the characteristics of an organism.” Then comes “short periods of rapid change during which new forms appear.” <dictionary. cambridge.org › dictionary › english › punct…> Similarly, in this pandemic, we are experiencing drastic change. “So, what should be our response to this equilibrium that has been punctuated in our ecosystem? Are we like dinosaurs, or mammals?” Why did the mammals thrive, besides luck? The answer is “Adaptability, adaptability and adaptability.” <www.thoughtworks. com › insights › blog › surviving-o..>. Adapting, would mean a change — a change in us? The equilibrium we need. It is not only a change on market forces that we would seek in the next stage of this pandemic. After a few months of relative calm, “we’ve started to see some striking evolution” of the virus. Biologist Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle wrote of the new strains on Twitter last week. <www.manila times.net › 2021/01/ 20 › news › national>. Unlettered about viruses, most of us did not expect the rise of Covid-19 mutations. They imply an uncertain end of the pandemic, threatening everyone’s psychological health. Gripped with constant fear of contracting the virus or its mutations, we worry over total loss of livelihood, disruption of quality education, a prolonged restriction of social contact, and a host of other uncertainties. Anxiety and/or depression impacts on us both as individuals and on our communities. To lift our spirits, let us count on the positives — the communal spirit of the Filipino which has openly asserted itself many times over. The nimble way is another welcomed change, unlike in prepandemic days, of more government departments in attending to healthcare, education and work interventions to battle with stress and sickness. While physical distance protocol narrows our social life, let’s be thankful for more time we gain for family, creating meaningful relations that we may have failed to nurture due to our professional activities. And thanks for increased awareness to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases emissions. All these positive developments, we hope would be sustained as we, with much uncertainty, try to adapt to the new normal. Redirecting punctuated equilibrium. Unlike the dinosaurs during the biological PT, we are not experiencing evolving physically. Thankfully, we had temporary stability during massive lockdowns, making us quite used to quarantines; some businesses and tourist spots were allowed to open. However, this short-lived seemingly stable phase, being disturbed by the new pandemic strains coming down on hapless victims, is robbing us of hope that some good change is near at hand. The change we hope for, amidst this massive global-wide uncertainty, is a stable state if there will be. Sadly, the PT theory considered, it proved to be short-lived, punctuated. Thus, to calm our fears, let us stay resilient; hold tight to optimism. Nurture a sense of control. Converse with ourselves. Keep tab of [our] own emotions.” Let’s stay connected with our own family and friends. Bond with the wider community. Extend help where we can. Hold on to hope and faith. This is a challenging phase of the equilibrium. But out of this experience, there comes learning that can “help us build a bridge to the future that is beyond this current crisis.” <www.continuousbreakthruz.com› blog › punctuated-e…> Hold on to our faith and hope in Him. “And when such a future comes, let us be ready and willing to embrace the change.” Putting our heart and mind on this change could be the beginning of a creative tension to initiate a healthy transformation. “There will be no normal to come back to because it is us who will have changed! Our perspectives will have shifted.” In such a punctuated equilibrium, there still is a future to build! Email: ttumapon@liceo.edu.ph",Manila Times

The “new normal” classification used to be the fifth, lowest quarantine classification before the IATF removed it in June. According to IATF’s guidelines on the implementation of community quarantine, “new normal” refers to “emerging behaviors, situations, and minimum public health standards that will be institutionalized in common or routine practices and remain even after the pandemic while the disease is not totally eradicated through means such as widespread immunization.” “These include actions that will become second nature to the general public as well as policies such as bans on large gatherings that will continue to remain in force,” it added.

Viruses mutate constantly and it takes just the right combination of particular mutations to escape vaccination. But studies are raising concern that first-generation Covid-19 vaccines don’t work as well against a mutant that first emerged in South Africa as they do against other versions circulating around the world. The good news: Many of the new Covid-19 vaccines are made with new, flexible technology that’s easy to upgrade. What’s harder: Deciding if the virus has mutated enough that it’s time to modify vaccines — and what changes to make. “When do you pull the trigger?” asked Norman Baylor, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief. “This is a moving target right now.” The WHO and FDA are looking to the global flu vaccine system in deciding how to handle similar decisions about Covid-19 shots. Influenza mutates much faster than the coronavirus, and flu shots have to be adjusted just about every year. National centers around the globe collect circulating flu viruses and track how they’re evolving. They send samples to WHO-designated labs for more sophisticated “antigenic” testing to determine vaccine strength. The WHO and regulators then agree on the year’s vaccine recipe and manufacturers get to work. For Covid-19 vaccines, Webby said a critical step is establishing a similar surveillance and testing network to flag the mutations that matter. Today, there’s wide geographic variability in tracking and testing mutated versions. For example, Britain does more testing of the changing viral genome than the United States. Three variants first discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil are worrisome because of combinations of mutations that make them more contagious. On Sunday, US researchers reported a still different mutation found in seven variants that have cropped up in several states. No one yet knows if this mutation makes the virus easier to spread but the report, not yet vetted by other scientists, urges further research to find out. In this Jan. 22, 2021 file photo, empty vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine are seen at a vaccination center at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. AP PHOTO Just because a variant is more contagious doesn’t mean it also will be impervious to vaccination. But the variant first identified in South Africa is raising concerns. Columbia University’s David Ho put blood samples from people given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines into lab dishes with the mutated virus. Vaccine-produced antibodies still protected, but they were much less potent. Preliminary test results of two other vaccine candidates — from Novavax and Johnson & Johnson — soon backed up those findings. Both still protected but were weaker when tested in South Africa, where that variant dominates, than when tested elsewhere. A far smaller test of the AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa has raised questions about its effect. “If the virus were able to make an additional mutation or two, it could escape even more,” Ho warned. If fully immunized people start getting hospitalized with mutated virus, “that’s when the line gets crossed,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia vaccine expert who advises the FDA. That hasn’t happened yet, but “we should get ready,” he added. Moderna is about to explore one option: Could a third dose of the original vaccine boost immunity enough to fend off some variants even if it’s not an exact match? Columbia’s Ho said it’s a good idea to test because people may “still have plenty of cushion” if their overall antibody levels are very high.

AP PHOTO Major manufacturers also are developing experimental variant vaccines, just in case. Covid-19 vaccines produce antibodies that recognize the spike protein that coats the coronavirus. When the virus mutates, sometimes the spike protein is changed in key areas so the vaccine-produced antibodies have a harder time recognizing it. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are made with a piece of genetic code called messenger RNA that tells the body how to make some harmless copies of the spike protein that train immune cells. To update the vaccine, they can simply change the payload: swap out the original genetic code with mRNA for the mutated spike protein. The AstraZeneca vaccine and the Johnson & Johnson shot expected to roll out soon are made with cold viruses engineered to sneak a spike protein gene into the body. Adjusting their vaccines requires growing cold viruses with the mutated gene, a little more complex than the mRNA approach but not nearly as laborious as reformulating old-fashioned flu shots. The Novavax vaccine also in final-stage testing is made with a lab-grown copy of the spike protein that also could be tweaked to match mutations. First-generation Covid-19 vaccines were tested in tens of thousands of people to be sure they work and are safe — research that took many months. Simply changing the recipe to better target virus mutations won’t require repeating those studies in thousands of people, Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s vaccine chief, recently told the American Medical Association. FDA still is finalizing requirements, but Marks said the agency intends to “be pretty nimble.” If an updated vaccine is needed, tests in a few hundred people likely would be enough to tell if it triggers a good immune response, he said. But an even bigger question: If only some places face vaccine-resistant virus mutants, would authorities want variant-only shots or vaccines that protect against two kinds in one jab? After all, flu vaccines protect against three or four different types in one shot. Companies would first have to perform some basic research to be sure a variant-only version properly revs up the immune system, said the Immunization Action Coalition’s John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive. Then a combination shot would need more testing to be sure there’s an equal response to both types.",Manila Times

Experts say it’s likely that some version of the disease will linger for years. But what it will look like in the future is less clear. Will the coronavirus, which has already killed more than 2 million people worldwide, eventually be eliminated by a global vaccination campaign, like smallpox? Will dangerous new variants evade vaccines? Or will the virus stick around for a long time, transforming into a mild annoyance, like the common cold? Eventually, the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 will become yet “another animal in the zoo,” joining the many other infectious diseases that humanity has learned to live with, predicted Dr. T. Jacob John, who studies viruses and was at the helm of India’s efforts to tackle polio and HIV/AIDS.

Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) But no one knows for sure. The virus is evolving rapidly, and new variants are popping up in different countries. The risk of these new variants was underscored when Novavax Inc. found that the company’s vaccine did not work as well against mutated versions circulating in Britain and South Africa. The more the virus spreads, experts say, the more likely it is that a new variant will become capable of eluding current tests, treatments and vaccines. For now, scientists agree on the immediate priority: Vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible. The next step is less certain and depends largely on the strength of the immunity offered by vaccines and natural infections and how long it lasts. “Are people going to be frequently subject to repeat infections? We don’t have enough data yet to know,” said Jeffrey Shaman, who studies viruses at Columbia University. Like many researchers, he believes chances are slim that vaccines will confer lifelong immunity. If humans must learn to live with Covid-19, the nature of that coexistence depends not just on how long immunity lasts, but also how the virus evolves. Will it mutate significantly each year, requiring annual shots, like the flu? Or will it pop up every few years? This question of what happens next attracted Jennie Lavine, a virologist at Emory University, who is co-author of a recent paper in Science that projected a relatively optimistic scenario: After most people have been exposed to the virus — either through vaccination or surviving infections — the pathogen “will continue to circulate, but will mostly cause only mild illness,” like a routine cold. While immunity acquired from other coronaviruses — like those that cause the common cold or SARS or MERS — wanes over time, symptoms upon reinfection tend to be milder than the first illness, said Ottar Bjornstad, a co-author of the Science paper who studies viruses at Pennsylvania State University. “Adults tend not to get very bad symptoms if they’ve already been exposed,” he said.  FILE – In this Nov. 12, 2020, file photo, people walk in a market to shop ahead of the Diwalli festival in New Delhi, India. Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File) The prediction in the Science paper is based on an analysis of how other coronaviruses have behaved over time and assumes that SAR-CoV-2 continues to evolve, but not quickly or radically. The 1918 flu pandemic could offer clues about the course of Covid-19. That pathogen was an H1N1 virus with genes that originated in birds, not a coronavirus. At the time, no vaccines were available. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a third of the world’s population became infected. Eventually, after infected people either died or developed immunity, the virus stopped spreading quickly. It later mutated into a less virulent form, which experts say continues to circulate seasonally. “Very commonly the descendants of flu pandemics become the milder seasonal flu viruses we experience for many years,” said Stephen Morse, who studies viruses at Columbia University. It’s not clear yet how future mutations in SARS-CoV-2 will shape the trajectory of the current disease. As new variants emerge — some more contagious, some more virulent and some possibly less responsive to vaccines — scientists are reminded how much they don’t yet know about the future of the virus, said Mark Jit, who studies viruses at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We’ve only known about this virus for about a year, so we don’t yet have data to show its behavior over five years or 10 years,” he said. Of the more than 12 billion coronavirus vaccine shots being made in 2021, rich countries have bought about 9 billion, and many have options to buy more. This inequity is a threat since it will result in poorer countries having to wait longer for the vaccine, during which time the disease will continue to spread and kill people, said Ian MacKay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland. A couple walk along a boulevard in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2021. Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) That some vaccines seem less effective against the new strains is worrisome, but since the shots provide some protection, vaccines could still be used to slow or stop the virus from spreading, said Ashley St. John, who studies immune systems at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India, said the evolution of the virus raises new questions: At what stage does the virus become a new strain? Will countries need to re-vaccinate from scratch? Or could a booster dose be given? “These are questions that you will have to address in the future,” Kang said. The future of the coronavirus may contrast with other highly contagious diseases that have been largely beaten by vaccines that provide lifelong immunity — such as measles. The spread of measles drops off after many people have been vaccinated. But the dynamic changes over time with new births, so outbreaks tend to come in cycles, explained Dr. Jayaprakash Muliyil, who studies epidemics and advises India on virus surveillance. Unlike measles, kids infected with Covid-19 don’t always exhibit clear symptoms and could still transmit the disease to vulnerable adults. That means countries cannot let their guard down, he said. Another unknown is the long-term impact of Covid-19 on patients who survive but are incapacitated for months, Kang said. The “quantification of this damage” — how many people can’t do manual labor or are so exhausted that they can’t concentrate — is key to understanding the full consequences of the disease. “We haven’t had a lot of diseases that have affected people on a scale like this,” she said.",Manila Times

There is also hate. In this image from video, Michael van der Veen, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, answers a question from Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., during the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Friday, Feb. 12, 2021. AP PHOTO US media recently reported an alarming increase of hate crimes committed against Asians and Asian Americans. These reports follow nearly a year’s worth of news about Black Lives Matter protests against the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, two of the many African Americans killed by law enforcers. Earlier this year, America, along with the rest of the world, was also shocked by protestors storming the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of its presidential elections. They were successful, but only for a short while. Now, the immediate past US president Donald Trump is on trial after his second impeachment. Not a few are also blaming Mr. Trump for the increase in hate crimes. By referring to Covid-19 as the China or Wuhan virus, the former president may have made Asians and Asian Americans the target of violence, as well as bigotry and xenophobia. Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University, told USA Today, “When President Trump began and insisted on using the term ‘China virus,’ we saw that hate speech really led to hate violence.” He added, “That sort of political rhetoric and that sort of anti-Asian climate has continued to this day.” Jeung created a tracker to monitor hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). His website, Stop AAPI Hate, recorded some 2,500 discrimination cases across the United States from March to August 2020. USA Today reported recently that the figure had risen to 2,808 by yearend. Other groups tracking those hate crimes corroborate the trend. The AAPI website said the most common type of discrimination was verbal harassment and name calling, 70.6 percent of the reports. Physical assault, the fourth most common type, represented 8.7 percent of the reported incidents. The victims varied from children to the elderly. The plurality of those reporting the incidents were ethnically Chinese, 40.4 percent and those of Filipino ethnicity, 7.6 percent. The same USA Today story mentioned a Filipino American, 61-year-old Noel Quintana, who suffered facial lacerations after he was attacked on the New York City subway by someone wielding a box cutter. There is worse. Earlier in January, an 84-year-old Thai living in San Francisco died after he was assaulted by someone who earlier shouted, “Go back to China.” Trump trial In fairness to Mr. Trump, he did make at least one public statement appealing for the safety of Asians and Pacific Islanders. But that was obviously too little. Also, it would be wrong to assign all the blame on the former president. Discrimination against Asians in America dates back to when Chinese immigrants were recruited to work on the US railroads. And who can forget the internment of Japanese Americans during World War 2? German Americans and other citizens descended from European countries that fought the United States did not suffer similar persecution. Still, that does not excuse Mr. Trump from stoking hate. He may be on trial for inciting an insurrection, but we hope that the US Senate finds him guilty for symbolic reasons. That may not happen, of course. As local politicians say, impeachment is a numbers game. For now, the Democrats do not seem to have the numbers needed to convict. But we still hope that US senators will vote not based on loyalty to one man but on moral principles and democratic values. As mentioned, perpetrating hate is not among the articles of impeachment. And if even Mr. Trump lost, the majority of the 74 million Americans who voted for him in 2020 still cling to lies, not only about the US elections but also about the pandemic and its economic impact. We recognize that US President Joseph Biden is rolling back many of his predecessor’s policies. By voting guilty, the US Senate reinforces the signal that America can transcend party politics and bring back decency. We hope America heals soon, not only from Covid-19 but also from moral decay.",Manila Times

The country also reported another 758 coronavirus-related deaths. The total number of coronavirus-related deaths in Britain now stands at 116,287. These figures only include the deaths of people who died within 28 days of their first positive test. The latest figures were revealed as Britain’s coronavirus R0 or reproduction number, also known as the R number, has fallen to below one for the first time since July 2020. The figure is now between 0.7 and 0.9, down from between 0.7 and 1.0 last week, according to the British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The R number represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above one, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below one it means the epidemic is shrinking. Meanwhile, Britain is stepping up efforts to speed up vaccine roll-out to bring the pandemic under control. More than 14 million people in Britain have been given the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest official figures. Britain aims to complete the vaccination of the top priority groups, which cover 15 million people, by mid-February. Downing Street has confirmed that all British adults aged 50 and older are expected to be offered a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine by early May. Britain aims to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. England is currently under the third national lockdown since the outbreak of the pandemic in the country. Similar restriction measures are also in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Germany, Russia and the United States have been racing against time to roll out coronavirus vaccines.",Manila Times

Neither of us could do what we do without the other. Unicef’s success is WHO’s success, and we are proud to be your partner on so many issues: Ebola, polio, maternal health, nutrition, infection prevention and control, primary healthcare — the list is long. Never has our partnership been more important than it is now. The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our world in ways we could never have imagined when it started just over a year ago. It’s sobering to think that on this day 12 months ago, more than 3,000 new cases of Covid-19 were reported to WHO. Yesterday (Feb. 10, 2021), 3,000 cases were reported every 15 minutes. The pandemic has held a mirror up to our world. It has shown humanity at its best and worst. It has exposed and exploited the fault lines, inequalities, injustices and contradictions of our world, within and between countries. The pandemic has also become a child emergency, with children bearing both its direct and indirect consequences. Children suffer
Children may be at lower risk of severe disease and death from Covid-19, but they have suffered many of the most severe social and economic consequences and will bear a large burden of the long-term fallout. Many children have missed out on months of schooling and have been exposed to a greater risk of violence. Girls are especially at risk in places where they may never go back to school, as they approach the age when they will go to work or be married. Since the beginning, Unicef has been, and will continue to be, an indispensable partner in ensuring that children are a primary consideration in the global response to Covid-19. Together, we have engaged, empowered and communicated with communities about the risks of Covid-19 and how to stay safe. We have developed joint guidance for the prevention and control of Covid-19 in schools; We’ve supported health workers with improved infection prevention and control, and we’ve supported them to deliver better care and psycho-social support for patients, their families and communities; we’ve procured and delivered essential supplies; We’ve provided the joint analytics that are key to an effective pandemic response; we’ve supported countries to maintain essential health services, including in humanitarian settings; And through the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator and Covax, we are poised for the largest vaccination campaign in history. Vaccines are the shot in the arm we all need, literally and metaphorically. But we must also remember that vaccines will complement, not replace, the proven public health measures that countries around the world have used successfully to prevent and contain widespread transmission. As governments, institutions and individuals, we all have a role to play in stopping this pandemic with the tools we have. The pandemic will subside, but the inequalities that preceded it will still be there. Respond, recover, rebuild
There’s no vaccine for climate change, poverty or malnutrition. None of these challenges can be met by a single agency. Let me outline three areas in which the partnership between WHO and Unicef, bilaterally and through the Global Action Plan on Health and Well-Being for All, must become even deeper and stronger as we work together to support countries to respond, recover and rebuild. First, as we support countries to respond to the pandemic, we must ensure that all people and communities enjoy equitable access to life-saving vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics — rich and poor, urban and rural, citizen and refugee. A year ago, we were defenseless against this virus. Now we can detect it with rapid diagnostic tests, we can treat it with dexamethasone and oxygen, and we can prevent it with vaccines. The urgency, ambition and resources with which vaccines have been developed must be matched by the same urgency, ambition and resources to distribute them fairly. Unicef has played a vital role in procuring vaccines and preparing countries to deploy them rapidly once they receive them. Together, we have supported 124 countries to perform readiness assessments for vaccination. But we face significant challenges. More than 130 million doses of vaccine have now been deployed globally, but 75 percent of them have been in only 10 countries that account for 60 percent of global GDP. Meanwhile, almost 130 countries, with 2.5 billion people, have yet to administer a single dose. Many of these countries are also struggling to secure the resources for testing, personal protective equipment, oxygen and medicines. I have issued a call to action to ensure that by World Health Day on April 7, vaccination of health workers is under way in all countries. Unicef can play a key role in meeting that challenge. As a trusted advocate, you can use your voice and experience in communities to build acceptance of vaccines; You can deploy your unparalleled logistics and supply capacities to deliver vaccines to the last mile. You can negotiate the best deals for the communities you serve. And you can mobilize your networks of national committees to resource this historic effort to save lives and livelihoods. Second, as we support countries to recover from the pandemic, we must support them to maintain essential health services, including routine immunization for children. The pandemic has shown that we can only meet the major crises of our time with a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach. In the same way, the challenges of child development can only be met with a multi-sectoral approach that addresses their access to services, their mental health and well-being, their nutrition, their risk factors for developing NCDs later in life, their educational outcomes, their chances on employment, and their need to be protected from violence. And third, as we support countries to rebuild from the pandemic, we must invest in primary health care. The pandemic has given us a brutal reminder of the importance of primary health care, as the eyes and ears of every health system, and the foundation of universal health coverage. Ultimately, our fight is not against a single virus. Our fight is against the inequalities that leave children in some countries exposed to deadly diseases that are easily prevented in others. Our fight is against the inequalities that mean women and their babies die during childbirth in some countries because of complications that are easily prevented in others. And our fight is to ensure that health is no longer a commodity or a luxury item, but a fundamental human right, and the foundation of the safer, fairer and more sustainable world we all want. History will not judge us solely by how we ended the Covid-19 pandemic, but what we learned, what we changed, and the future we left our children.

Dr. Alethea de Guzman of the department’s Epidemiology Bureau said based on the overall caseload, the national Covid-19 growth rate has dropped a bit and the healthcare utilization rate for all regions is in the safe zone. The number of severe and critical cases has also gone down, from 8 to 9 percent a few months ago to just 5 percent this month. De Guzman said there was a minor surge in the middle of January because of increased mobility and crowd gatherings during the holiday season. The DoH said while that the two-week growth rate and the average daily attack rate have gone down in the past few weeks, three regions — Cagayan Valley, Central Visayas, Soccsksargen (South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani, and General Santos City) and Caraga — posted positive growth rates in the past weeks, placing them under moderate risk. In Cagayan Valley, the increase was observed in Cagayan and Isabela provinces and Santiago City. In Central Visayas, Cebu province, including the cities of Cebu, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue, are experiencing a steep rise in cases. Caraga, Agusan del Norte and Dinagat Island were the only areas with a dropping number of cases. Other priority areas flagged by the DoH are Naga City, Mountain Province, Kalinga, Baguio City, Compostela Valley, Tacloban City, Davao City, Benguet, Makati City, Ifugao, Davao del Norte, Lanao del Sur and Bataan. “Kahit na maliit na numero ito, fina-flag na namin (Even if the number of cases are small, we are flagging this) because spikes in cases can start very small, we do not want them to reach high numbers again,” de Guzman said. The number of Covid-19 deaths rose slightly to 2.11 percent due to the continuing harmonization of data together with the Philippine Statistics Authority, de Guzman said. Meanwhile, Dr. Guido David of the Octa Research Group has warned that if the uptrend in Cebu City continues, the city’s hospital bed capacity will exceed the current 850 beds, with occupancy reaching up to 1,200 by March 1. The country logged 1,734 Covid cases on Thursday, for a total of 543,282 cases. The DoH also said it has traced the lone case of the new Covid-19 variant who listed Liloan, Cebu, as his hometown, in Quezon City, where he is now isolated. The Quezon City government said the 35-year-old male moved to Sucat, Parañaque City and made frequent visits to his manning agency in Malate, Manila. His last visit was on
January 14 after he secured another overseas placement. While waiting for deployment, the man rode a cab and stayed in a hotel in Manila on January 17, where he took a swab test. His results returned positive the same day and his sample was sent to the Philippine Genome Center until January 21, when his agency booked a ride-hailing cab and transferred him to an apartment in Riverside in Commonwealth, Quezon City. The genome sequencing results released on February 5 showed that he was positive for the B117 variant. Three days later, he developed a mild cough. De Guzman said the patient, a former overseas Filipino worker, traveled from Cebu to Manila to process his papers. He added that because of the patient’s mobility, the case investigation now involves several cities where he made his contacts.",Manila Times

https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/11/news/headlines/cebu-on-the-brink/839554/,Cebu on the brink,Red Mendoza,2021-02-11 00:00:00,"Cebu City’s hospital capacity could reach critical levels if coronavirus cases continue to rise, an academic group that tracks the country’s Covid-19 data warned on Wednesday. Octa Research said Covid-19 cases have spiked in Cebu City since February 1, and if the trend would continue, its hospital capacity would reach critical levels in two weeks. From February 1 to 7, the city averaged 123 new cases per day, 30 percent higher than the 94 cases recorded from January 25 to 31. Its positivity rate also increased to 10 percent and its attack rate to 11.11 per 100,000 population. Neighboring Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu cities also saw spikes, with positivity rates above 10 percent. The group warned that the hospital occupancy in the province might reach 70 percent in two weeks if the current transmission rate of R0 (R-naught) 1.4 and a hospitalization rate of 25 to 35 percent holds. Octa said the increase in the number of cases in the city may be attributed to the presence of the more infectious B117 variant, which was detected in Liloan, Cebu. The Department of Health (DoH) acknowledged that there was an increase in the number of cases in the city but said the spike might not be because of the spread of the new variant that originated in the United Kingdom. “Hindi ho natin masasabi na variant lang ang cause. [Maaring] naka aggravate or makasama sya sa (We can’t say that this variant is the cause. There could be other things that have aggravated it or there were other) factors but it is not the only cause of the numbers increasing in Cebu. Marami pa pong factors ‘yan (There are many factors),” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said. She said other factors such as gatherings held during the holidays and delays in consultation, wherein some people take three to five days to consult doctors for symptoms after they got exposed to a close Covid-19 contact, could also be behind the spike. Vergeire said the One Hospital Command in Cebu City is managing the situation to prevent a possible surge in hospital care capacity. Octa said the National Capital Region continues to see a flattening trend in the number of Covid-19 cases despite having an R0 of1.02 and an average of 360 new cases per day. Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) and Central Luzon had decreased their positivity rate to 5 and 4 percent, respectively, while Davao’s case numbers were also decreasing. Meanwhile, the DoH sought the help of the National Bureau of Investigation to locate a patient with the B117 variant who listed Liloan, Cebu as his hometown to determine his date of exit and see if he had indeed left the country. It is also set to sequence more than 700 samples from the National Capital Region, Calabarzon, Cordillera and Central Visayas to see if there were more cases of the new variant. Vergeire earlier said that the vaccines from the Covax Facility, which consists of the first batch of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech tozinameran vaccine, might arrive on February 13. It will only take two to three days upon arrival for the vaccines to be administered to frontliners in health facilities. The Health Technology Assessment Council gave its approval for the use of tozinameran and AstraZeneca’s AZD1222 vaccines. In its assessment reports released on Feb. 2 and 8, 2021, respectively, the council said both vaccines passed its appraisals. On Wednesday, the DoH logged 1,345 new cases of Covid-19, for a total of 541,560 total cases, of which 30,188 are active. Priority The DoH also said it was open to the proposal of Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go to include national athletes in the vaccine priority list. Go urged the government to vaccinate national athletes who would compete in international sporting competitions this year such as the Olympics and the Southeast Asian Games. Vergeire said the DoH was open to the idea, but it has to consult with the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (Nitag) to see if athletes can be prioritized. “Kung hinain natin ito sa Nitag at binigyan natin ng (If we propose this at the Nitag and we would start the) discussions and they would recommend being included, then we will include them,” Vergeire said. She said frontline healthcare workers would be the first to get jabs. “Wala pong ibang sektor ang mawawala sa listahan just because of this request. Ilalagay lang natin sa konteksto, and we will discuss this with experts so we can find the best way possible para maconsider itong mga ganitong (No other sectors will be removed in the list just because of this request. We will just put this into context, and we will discuss with experts so we can find the best way possible to consider this) request,” Vergeire said.",Manila Times
https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/11/opinion/columnists/covid-19-gets-deadlier-and-tougher-to-stop/839484/,Covid-19 gets deadlier — and tougher to stop,Ricardo Saludo,2021-02-11 00:00:00,"IF you think the rapid development and dissemination of vaccines would finally tame the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), think again. Besides the unprecedented challenges and risks of developing, testing, procuring, transporting, storing, and administering vaccines within extremely tight time frames to billions of people — everything never been done before — there’s the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which have been happening since the virus first spread from Wuhan, Central China, over a year ago, may make it deadlier and harder to stop, even with immunization. Indeed, a new British study now undergoing peer review has calculated a 30-percent greater death risk from the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B117, first detected in the United Kingdom last September and found in at least 70 countries, including the Philippines, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in late January. This greater fatality risk could be as high as 35 percent. That means if past coronavirus strains killed 1,000 people a day, the new one could snuff out 1,350 lives, according to the study by the Center for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250959v1). The CMMID researchers estimated “that the hazard of death among SGTF [or B117] cases is 30 percent … higher than among non-SGTF cases after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation level, care home residence, local authority of residence and date of test.” And taking account of misclassification of UK-variant patients, the estimated fatality risk would be 35 percent more. What’s worse, there are signs in a small number of UK cases that the British variant may have a mutation first seen in the South African and Brazilian variants, which makes the coronavirus less vulnerable to antibodies produced by people with Covid-19 or vaccination. If confirmed by more data from a wider range of cases, this additional mutation, called E484K, would make B117, which is already more transmissible by as much as 70 percent, also more resistant to immunization. In short, Covid-19 is getting deadlier and harder to stop. Wear masks and find cures
These findings are still being validated by more research. But strategic risk analysis would point to two likely and worrisome trends. First, more infectious variants like B117 will eventually predominate, since it infects more people and spreads faster than the older strains. Moreover, mutations resistant to antibodies would also become prevalent, since more of such strains survive than past ones. Indeed, as immunization spreads, resistant variants would become dominant sooner since the nonresistant ones would die out faster due to vaccinations. These risk factors underscore the imperative that the world continue mask wearing and other prevention protocols and work not only on vaccines but also cures, especially for severe cases that fill hospitals and morgues. The provision of Covid-19 remedies would also consume far less resources than vaccination. For one thing, severe cases requiring medical treatment constitute just a tiny fraction of the population, while vaccination must cover more than half the nation for it to prevent massive deaths. Moreover, a number of remedies have been developed by repurposing existing medications like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which are often cheap compared with newly developed vaccines. And the side effects of these formulations are already well known, so they can be prescribed with proper safeguards. And if the state expands intensive care units and ventilators nationwide, these facilities would be of use for years and for other illnesses besides Covid-19, unlike vaccines. Hence, in its pandemic responses and budgeting, the government must give as much consideration to medical treatment of the thousands of severe Covid-19 cases as rolling out vaccines for tens of millions of Filipinos, purchased with many billions of dollars in loans which would burden the economy for many years. For this reason, we commend the Department of Science and Technology and its Philippine Council for Health Research and Development for their programs and funding to develop local Covid-19 remedies. One that this writer is involved with is the formulation and testing of a drug combining the anti-inflammatory medicine methylprednisolone and the anesthetic procaine, pushed by Covid cure advocate Ruby Ann Kagaoan and undertaken by the De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute in Dasmariñas, Cavite, and the University of the Philippines College of Pharmacy in Manila. Plainly, with vaccines not only hugely expensive and difficult to deploy, but also unsure of success due to coronavirus mutations, the Philippines must make sure to develop and deploy medication and facilities for severely ill Covid-19 patients, who will continue to be among us, vaccines or no vaccines.",Manila Times

A closely watched visit by World Health Organization (WHO) experts to Wuhan — the Chinese city where the first coronavirus cases were discovered — did not dramatically change the current understanding of the early days of the pandemic, said Peter Ben Embarek, the leader of the WHO mission. But it did “add details to that story,” he said at a news conference as the group wrapped up a four-week visit to the city. And it allowed the joint Chinese-WHO team to further explore the lab leak theory — which former US President Donald Trump and officials from his administration had put forward without evidence — and decide it was unlikely. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is home to many different virus samples, leading to allegations that it may have been the source of the original outbreak, whether on purpose or accidentally. Peter Ben Embarek of the World Health Organization team holds up a chart showing pathways of transmission of the virus during a joint press conference held at the end of the WHO mission in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province on Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Embarek, a WHO food safety and animal disease expert, said experts now consider the possibility of such a leak so improbable that it will not be suggested as an avenue of future study. But another team member, Danish scientist Thea Koelsen Fischer, told reporters that team members could not rule out the possibility of further investigation and new leads. China had already strongly rejected the possibility of a leak and has promoted other theories. The Chinese and foreign experts considered several ideas for how the disease first ended up in humans, leading to a pandemic that has now killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide. Embarek said the initial findings suggest the most likely pathway the virus followed was from a bat to another animal and then to humans, adding that would require further research. “The findings suggest that the laboratory incidents hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus to the human population,” he said. Liang Wannian, the head of the Chinese side, noted that there was no sample of the virus that causes Covid-19 in the lab — and thus it could not have come from there. The mission was intended to be an initial step in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, which scientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat. Transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, Embarek said. The WHO team’s visit is politically sensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. An AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and ordered scientists not to speak to reporters. A WHO-China Joint Study Press Conference is held at the end of a WHO mission to investigate the origins of the coronavirus pandemic in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province, Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Still, one member of the WHO team, British-born zoologist Peter Daszak, told The Associated Press last week that they enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested. Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries. The team — which includes experts from 10 countries who arrived on Jan. 14 — visited the Huanan Seafood Market, the site of an early cluster of cases in late 2019. Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist on the team, said that some animals at the market were susceptible or suspected to be susceptible to the virus, including rabbits and bamboo rats. And some could be traced to farms or traders in regions that are home to the bats that carry the closest related virus to the one that causes Covid-19. She said the next step would be to look more closely at farms. Liang, the head of the Chinese team, said the virus also appeared to have been spreading in parts of the city other than the market, so it remains possible that the virus originated elsewhere.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) The team found no evidence that the disease was spreading widely any earlier than the initial outbreak in the second half of December 2019. “We haven’t been able to fully do the research, but there is no indication there were clusters before what we saw happen in the later part of December in Wuhan,” Liang said. The visit by the WHO team took months to negotiate. China only agreed to it amid international pressure at the WHO’s World Health Assembly meeting last May, and Beijing has continued to resist calls for a strictly independent investigation. While China has weathered some localized resurgences of infection since getting the outbreak under control last year, life in Wuhan itself has largely returned to normal.",Manila Times

According to Galvez, the global vaccination figure has reached 300 million, with seven million people being vaccinated per day.“We are happy that the Philippines is part of those numbers and that we have already administered more or less 44,000 doses,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino.
Galvez said many people were requesting “almost every day” allocations of the vaccines, an indication of their willingness to get immunized against the deadly respiratory disease.
“When we had the vaccination of hospital directors, their level of confidence increased,“ he said.
The Philippines kicked off its COVID-19 vaccination program last Monday, after the arrival of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the vaccine produced by China’s Sinovac BioTech.
The first to get vaccinated was the director of the Philippine General Hospital, Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi.
Also last week, over 400,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered.
Earlier, Malacañang said more than 29,000 individuals had been vaccinated against COVID-19.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1372054/explainer-facts-about-7-covid-19-vaccines-philippines-may-get,Explainer: Facts about 7 COVID-19 vaccines Philippines may get,Cristina Eloisa Baclig,2020-12-15 20:45:00,"MANILA, Philippines — As the country pursues avenues to secure COVID-19 vaccines, prices of available and soon-to-be-available COVID-19 vaccines started to evoke curiosity.
The senators, for one, have begun analyzing the price tags of the seven vaccine brands that the Philippines might obtain for its planned inoculation program.Data released by Senate committee on finance chair Sonny Angara detailed the prices of the different vaccines for two doses per person. The total price of each vaccine is inclusive of the value-added tax (VAT) and the cost of inflation.
It also stated how many Filipinos could be inoculated based on the vaccine’s price and the P82.5 billion budget allotted by the Philippine government for acquiring COVID-19 vaccines next year.
Data from Senator Sonny Angara’s Office
Moderna
According to Angara’s data, Moderna’s vaccine will cost around P3,904 to P4,504 for two doses per person. This is the most expensive among the list of vaccines based on the senator’s information.
Approximately 18,317,051 to 21,132,172 Filipinos may receive this vaccine under the earmarked P82.5 billion budget for COVID-19 vaccines, Angara said.
About Moderna: Moderna is a Massachusetts-based biotechnology company that focuses on drug discovery and development. It also makes vaccines based on mRNA (messenger RNA).
How their vaccine works: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website said the vaccine, also known as “mRNA-1273,” basically uses mRNA, a genetic molecule that carries the instructions for making proteins in our body. This vaccine requires two shots that will be given 28 days apart.
The mRNA in the vaccine will instruct cells to make a harmless spike protein – which can also be seen on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the new variant of coronavirus that causes respiratory disease COVID-19, said the CDC website.
According to the CDC, the protruding spikes and spike fragments in the cell will then be recognized by the immune system and cause an immune response that produces antibodies.
These antibodies stop the coronavirus from attacking other cells by attaching to the virus’s spikes. The antibodies can also mark the virus so other cells can detect and destroy it.Moderna’s vaccine needs to be stored at -20C.
Status development: Moderna announced last month that it has finished the first interim analysis of the Phase 3 study for mRNA-1273. According to the company, the study showed that its vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent.
Issues and concerns: Based on a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Moderna’s vaccine can protect for at least three months.
But according to a report by the New York Times, since the vaccine is new, researchers still have no idea how long the vaccine’s protection will last.
The report added that the number of antibodies and T-cells might reduce months after the vaccination. However, memory B-cells and memory-T cells might retain the information about the coronavirus even after years or decades.
Roll-out: Moderna applied for emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on November 30. USFDA is set to decide on its application on December 17. If approved, Moderna can start releasing its vaccines in the US before the end of the month.
Sinovac
The second-most-expensive vaccine on the data is Sinovac with a price tag of P 3,629.50 for two doses per person. Some 22,730,403 Filipinos may benefit from the vaccine if acquired by the government, according to Angara’s information.
About Sinovac: Sinovac is a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company founded in 2001. Their focus is on the research, development, and manufacture of vaccines against infectious diseases such as H1N1 influenza and COVID-19.
How their vaccine works: Unlike Moderna, which uses RNA in its vaccines, Sinovac’s CoronaVac relies on inactivated pathogens that are grown and killed in laboratories.
Similar to the inactivated vaccines used for polio, this vaccine uses the killed viruses to produce antigens which signal the immune system to attack the virus causing COVID-19.
CoronaVac can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius.
Status development:In October, Sinovac submitted its application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the Philippines to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials for CoronaVac in the country.
READ: After passing PH vaccine panel evaluation, Sinovac seeks FDA OK
COVID-19 policy chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said that the vaccine may be the first to be rolled out in the country, probably by the first quarter of 2021.
Sinovac has yet to report the efficacy rate of CoronaVac.
Issues and concerns:Sinovac has been recently reported to be involved in a bribery scandal. However, the company cleared out its CEO, Yin Weidong, of the accusations.
Roll-out:According to Galvez, they are already finalizing negotiations with Sinovac. He said the pharmaceutical firm vowed to supply vaccines in the country by April 2021. However, Galvez negotiated to get it by March.
Pfizer-BioNTech
Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech’s vaccine costs P2,379 for two doses per person. Data showed that roughly 34,678,436 Filipinos may get the shots based on the government’s allocated fund for vaccine procurement next year.
About Pfizer and BioNTech: US-based multinational pharmaceutical corporation, Pfizer, is also known as one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies.
On the other hand, BioNTech SE is a German biotechnology company that focuses on individualized immunotherapies.
How their vaccine works:Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine is similar to Moderna’s mRNA-1273 in the sense that it uses mRNA to eliminate the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine requires storage with a temperature of -70 degrees Celsius.
Status development:Pfizer and BioNTech concluded the Phase 3 study for their vaccine on November 18. Meanwhile, the USFDA on December 12 granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, and on December 14 started its use in New York City.
The United Kingdom, the first country in the world to conduct mass inoculation against COVID-19 starting December 8, likewise used the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.
On Monday, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Long announced the approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for his country’s mass vaccination program that will likely begin by end-December. Later, Jordan announced it had approved emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine.
Pfizer’s vaccine showed a 95 percent efficacy rate during its study.
Issues and concerns: U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on December 10 issued an anaphylaxis warning on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after reports of three cases of adverse reactions.
According to MHRA, there were two reports of anaphylaxis and one possible allergic reaction after administering the vaccines.
“Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,” MHRA Chief Executive June Raine said in a statement.
“Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against COVID-19 outweigh the risks… You can be completely confident that this vaccine has met the MHRA’s robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness,” Raine assured.
Roll-out: Pfizer-BioNTech began its first shipment of the vaccines to several states in America on December 13.
Gamaleya
Named after the first Soviet space satellite, Gamaleya Research Institutes’s Sputnik V vaccine is worth P 1,220 for two doses per person. According to the data provided by Angara, with its price, the vaccine may be administered to 67,622,950 Filipinos using the P82.5 billion budget.
About Gamaleya: The Gamelaya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology is a Russian medical-research institute founded in 1891.
According to Gamelaya, it “runs one of the unique “virus libraries” in the world and has its own vaccine production facility.”
Aside from their research for the COVID-19 vaccine, they are also working to develop a vaccine against Ebola and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).
How their vaccine works: Sputnik V is a two-part adenovirus-based vector vaccine. It uses a vector (an engineered virus that lacks the gene to reproduce) to send a message in cells to produce spike proteins.
“The gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed while a gene with the code of a protein from another virus spike is inserted,” the institute explained.
“This inserted element is safe for the body but still helps the immune system to react and produce antibodies, which protect us from the infection,” it added.

Sputnik V is stored in a regular refrigerator temperature (in dry form).
Status development: Gamaleya on November 24 announced that it has finished the second interim analysis of clinical trial data for Sputnik V.
READ: Russia vaccine ‘passes early trial test’
“The Sputnik V vaccine’s efficacy is confirmed at 91.4% based on data analysis of the final control point of clinical trials. The Sputnik V vaccine efficacy against severe cases of coronavirus is 100%,” Gamaleya reported.
In October, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) submitted applications to the World Health Organization for an Emergency Use Listing and prequalification of Sputnik V.
According to a report on Monday, Russia is almost done completing its clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine for domestic animals and mink.
Issues and concerns: Some scientists have recently expressed concerns towards Sputnik V due to a “lack of safety data.” However, Russia denounced the criticisms.
Roll-out: Galvez recently said that the Russian vaccine may possibly be available in the Philippines as early as the first quarter of 2021.
COVAX Facility
COVAX Facility, compared to the first four companies on the list, offers a lower price for COVID-19 vaccines. Data showed that it will only cost around P854 for two doses per person. It can vaccinate at least 96,604,215 Filipinos, based on the information of Senator Angara.
About COVAX Facility: COVAX Facility, also known as the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Acces Facility, is a global mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.
It is co-led by Gavi, an international organization created to improve access to new and underused vaccines, along with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization.
The Philippines joined COVAX Facility in July.
How does COVAX Facility work? “The COVAX Facility will make investments across a broad portfolio of promising vaccine candidates (including those being supported by CEPI) to make sure at-risk investment in manufacturing happens now,” Gavi explained.
Since it follows a pooling process, COVAX can ensure rapid access to vaccines.
Status about COVID-19 vaccine: According to the Philippines’ vaccine czar Galvez, about 80 percent of the vaccines in the global market were already taken by rich countries. The COVAX Facility, on the other hand, was able to acquire 2 percent.
This means that the country is “fighting” to secure the other 18 percent of the vaccine supply.
AstraZeneca
AstraZeneca’s vaccine is worth only P610 for two doses per person. This appeared to be ideal for the country’s budget. Given its price and the P82.5 billion allocation of the government for vaccine procurement next year, it can inoculate 135,245,901 Filipinos, Angara’s graph indicated.
About AstraZeneca: AstraZeneca is a British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the development and commercialization of prescription medicine.
Their medicines are targeted for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, inflammation, autoimmune, oncology, infection, and neuroscience diseases.
AstraZeneca collaborated with the University of Oxford to create a COVID-19 vaccine.
How their vaccine works:Like Russia’s Sputnik V, AstraZeneca’s vaccines use a genetically altered virus called adenovirus. This virus, which is not harmful to recipients, will carry spike protein (like the “crowns” in coronavirus). Injecting this, in theory, will help the immune system to recognize and attack coronavirus.
AstraZeneca’s vaccine requires a regular fridge temperature for storage.
Status development: AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford announced on December 8 that it finished the Phase 3 interim analysis for the vaccine.
The researchers noted that the efficacy rate for two doses – with the first dose at half strength – reached 90 percent. While a combination of two full-strength doses only resulted in 62 percent efficacy.
READ: AstraZeneca says COVID-19 ‘vaccine for the world’ can be 90% effective
Issues and concerns: Scientists questioned the vaccine efficacy rate after the reported error in dosage. In a report published by the New York Times on November 25, experts inquired how the combination of half dosage for the first shot and full dosage for the second shot resulted in a 90 percent efficacy rate.
Roll-out:According to the Department of Health (DOH), the government is negotiating with the firm, after AstraZeneca pulled out its application to conduct clinical trials in the country noting it already has enough data for the vaccine tests.
READ: Getting AstraZeneca vaccine still ‘doable’ even with company pullout from trial
“We are already having negotiations with AstraZeneca. So their next step would be the application for an emergency use authorization here in the country if ever and also with the other countries. So ito pong FDA (Food and Drug Administration) process na natin ang kanilang pag-a-applyan (This is the FDA process they have to undergo),” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Monday.
Novavax
Among the seven vaccines in the data presented by Angara, Novovax was the most affordable. Two doses of Novavax vaccine costs only P366 per person, thus, some 225,409,836 Filipinos can receive and benefit from it amid the P82.5 billion budget.
About Novavax: Novavax, a late-stage US biotechnology company, focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of vaccines to prevent serious infectious diseases.
This Maryland company is smaller compared to other vaccine manufacturers. They received a $1.6 billion grant from the US government’s Operation Warp Speed to produce 100 million doses by 2021.
How their vaccines work: According to an article published in the Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Novavax first inserts baculovirus into moth cells.
The baculovirus, a pathogen that attacks insects, will make moth cells produce a protein called spike – which is present in coronavirus.
The spikes are then harvested by scientists and mixed with a “synthetic soap like particle” where the spikes can latch on. A compound called saponin, also derived from plants and trees, is also added to boost the immune response.
The NVX‑CoV2373 vaccine aims to produce anti spike antibodies that can block SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Status development: As of November 30, Novavax said in a statement that it has completed the enrollment of its 15,000-patient UK Phase 3 trial. The company added that has fully enrolled the Phase 2b trial in South Africa.
“Novavax expects its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States and Mexico to begin in the coming weeks. More than 100 trial sites have been selected with some alternate sites in place, should they be needed,” the company added.
Roll-out: Since the vaccine is still in its early trial stages, there is still no expected release date.
However, the Indian pharmaceutical company Serum Institute of India (SII) previously committed to making the Novavax vaccine available in the country once it is developed.

Although he did not detail the number of doses for each brand, Galvez said these 20 million doses would come from Sinovac BioTech, the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility, Novovax, and AstraZeneca.The 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca ordered by the private sector might arrive in May or June, Galvez said.
The Philippine government and the private sector signed an agreement to buy those doses with AstraZeneca in November 2020.
By the second quarter of this year, the government is eyeing to vaccinate economic frontliners.

https://opinion.inquirer.net/136192/covid-19-vaccines-in-the-philippine-context,COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippine context,Gideon Lasco,2020-12-16 05:05:00,"Several months and over 400,000 COVID-19 cases later, the Philippines has begun its long-awaited and promised process of acquiring vaccines as a means to end the pandemic. As early as April, President Duterte spoke optimistically of the prospects of a vaccine. Realistically, however, we must be aware of the realities of vaccination in the recent past in order to truly ensure its success.
Before looking at the advances of COVID-19 vaccine technology, it is important to look at the role immunization has played in the Philippine health care system. Indeed, this has been one of the cornerstones of preventive care for disease not just of childhood (mumps, chickenpox) but eventual adult concerns (HPV, pneumonia) as well. Yet despite the government’s Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and the National Immunization Program (NIP), the country has seen a drop in population coverage, leading to the resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles, diphtheria, and even poliomyelitis in the past decade. The Philippines’ circulating vaccine-derived polio cases in 2019-2020 placed us on a list with African countries struggling to end the transmission of this disease.Many attribute the dismal immunization coverage to the dengue vaccine scandal, but while it doubtless eroded vaccines confidence in the Philippines, our immunization programs have actually been problematic long before Dengvaxia, failing to reach the coverage goal of 95 percent for many years now. The scandal only represented the nadir of what’s already been an alarming trend.
In fact, when it comes to timeliness of vaccination, the 2017 National Demographic and Health Survey showed only a 10.6 percent rate for all vaccines (ranging from 38 to 67 percent per vaccine). The gaps in delivery boil down to the quality and accessibility of our public health system, which, during the recent polio vaccinations, for instance, relied heavily on private sector support. It also faces a lot of challenges when it comes to maintaining the cold chain.
Looking forward to the COVID-19 vaccines, there have been major breakthroughs, the speed and complexity of which have never been encountered before. Of those nearing approval, there are two mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer—both requiring negative temperatures in their delicate handling. There are also the vector-based vaccines from Astra-
Zeneca and Gamaleya’s Sputnik V, as well as China’s inactivated vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac, all of which will only need normal refrigerated temperature.
Beyond the vaccine type, its corresponding handling, and the limitations of our health infrastructure, a major concern is the potential politicization of the acquisition, prioritization, and distribution protocols that will be put in place. There have been conflicting reports on who will be vaccinated first—health workers, vulnerable individuals, the poor, and uniformed personnel—according to different government agencies. There is also a need to address people’s concerns about the vaccines, from fears of being made “guinea pigs” to misconceptions about side effects and efficacy.
Surprisingly, there are reports of politicians having already received the vaccine, even if no emergency use authorizations have been granted by the local FDA. The vaccine “czar,” Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., also mentioned that equitable access to the vaccine will only be achieved by 2022—an election year, which may bring about a predicament not unlike that of Dengvaxia in 2016, which some quarters allege was funded and launched for political considerations. These issues once again raise the danger of politicizing vaccination, especially if the process for prioritization will have potential interference from vested interests. With the urgency called for by the still uncontrolled pandemic, the success of not just the COVID-19 vaccine, but also of the entire vaccination institution in our country, hangs in the balance.
In the end, however, the solution for COVID-19 goes beyond vaccination. The World Health Organization reminds governments of the continuous need to strengthen their countries’ health system to provide for adequate testing, tracing, quarantine, treatment, and monitoring, aside from the provision of essential services. States must invest in public health to strengthen the infrastructure for pandemic preparedness, and to ensure the well-being of all, now more than ever.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1399299/covid-19-vaccine-bill-now-up-for-dutertes-signature,COVID-19 vaccine bill now up for Duterte’s signature,Christia Marie Ramos,2021-02-23 22:07:00,"MANILA, Philippines — A bill seeking to speed up the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the country and establish an indemnity fund now only needs the signature of President Rodrigo Duterte.
This, after the House of Representatives, adopted the Senate’s version of the proposed Covid-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021.During the House session on Tuesday, the lower chamber approved a motion to adopt Senate Bill No. 2057 as an amendment to House Bill No. 8648, passed on Monday.
READ: House OKs bill expediting Covid-19 vaccine purchase, creating indemnification fund
With the House’s concurrence with the Senate bill, a bicameral conference committee will no longer be needed to reconcile the disagreeing provisions of the chambers’ respective versions of the measure.
Under Senate Bill No. 2057, the national government, local government units (LGUs) and the private sector will be authorized to procure COVID-19 vaccines through the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) and the Department of Health (DOH).
READ: Senate OKs bill expediting vaccine purchase, creating indemnity fund
LGUs, on the other hand, will be allowed to directly procure the ancillary supplies and services necessary for the storage, transport, and deployment of the vaccines.
The measure will also exempt LGUs from certain provisions of the existing procurement laws.
Among the laws covered by the exemption are the Government Procurement Reform Act, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and the Local Government Code.
“The bill will provide legal cover to the LGUs, many of which have intimated to us their concern about possible adverse findings by the Commission on Audit and even graft cases that may be filed against their officials,” Senator Sonny Angara, sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.A significant number of LGUs have started preparing for the rollout of their respective vaccination programs and are waiting for the bill’s enactment to exempt them from the legal requirements regarding the procurement of goods, the senator noted.
For the private firms, their procurement of Covid-19 vaccines will be done in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through a multiparty agreement.
Meanwhile, a national indemnity fund will be established under the bill to compensate any individual inoculated through the Covid-19 vaccination program, in case of death or for the treatment of possible severe adverse effects.
The bill authorizes a P500-million augmentation, sourced from the Contingent Fund of the 2021 national budget to the existing funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth), which will manage the indemnity fund.
“The indemnity fund will cover the indemnification agreements with the vaccine manufacturers, which the NTF has started fulfilling. This removes one major stumbling block to the delivery of the vaccines to the country,” Angara said.
According to the senator, another provision of the bill seen to help bring in more Covid-19 vaccines and other critical supplies to the country is the exemption of its purchases from taxes and duties.
Vaccine cards
Under the bill, the DOH, LGUs and private entities will be required to issue “vaccine cards” to individuals who have been inoculated.
The cards will contain basic information about the individual; the manufacturer and brand of the vaccine administered; the date of vaccination; the date of last RT-PCR testing; and the facility’s names where the vaccine was received and the health professionals who administered the vaccine.
Senator Francis Tolentino introduced an amendment to the bill ensuring that the “vaccine card” to be issued by LGUs will not be considered a mandatory requirement in educational, employment, and similar government transaction purposes.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1383971/govt-to-issue-covid-19-vaccine-passports-doh,Gov’t to issue COVID-19 vaccine passports — DOH,Cathrine Gonzales,2021-01-15 12:49:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Filipinos who will be vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will be issued vaccine passports by the Philippine government, the Department of Health (DOH) said Friday.“Itong vaccine passport na ito, meron po tayo. Magkakaroon po tayo ng ganyan, and as we have said in the previous na mga pag-uusap, magkakaroon po tayo ng data registry for all recipients,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in an online press briefing.
(We will have a vaccine passport, and as we have said in previous talks, we will have a data registry for all recipients.)
According to Vergeire, a QR code will be given to every individual who would be vaccinated against COVID-19.
“This would be something of a unique identifier for a specific person who will receive the vaccine, and dito magkakaroon din po sila ng card na nagsasabi na sila ay nabakunahan, either with one dose or two doses. This will serve as their certificate that they have been vaccinated,” she added.
(This will be a unique identifier for a specific person who will receive the vaccine, and they will have a card that will indicate that they have been vaccinated, either with one or two doses.)
Vergeire said she believes that the vaccine passport, once it is widely implemented, will be part of protocols for border control in different countries.
In December last year, Ang Probinsyano party-list Rep. Ronnie Ong filed House Bill No. 8280, or the Vaccination Passport Act, which seeks the issuance of vaccine passports for those who will receive vaccine shots during the country’s mass vaccination program against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1385907/duterte-will-get-vaccine-shot-in-private,Duterte will get COVID-19 vaccine shot in private,Leila B. Salaverria,2021-01-20 04:53:00,"MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte will be given the COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes available in the Philippines, but he will be vaccinated behind closed doors, Malacañang said on Tuesday.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the public would be informed if the vaccine had been administered to Mr. Duterte.Roque was answering a question about the President’s willingness to take the first shot of CoronaVac, the COVID-19 vaccine made by the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech.
‘No problem’
He said he had talked to Mr. Duterte about the question and the President had responded, “No problem, I will take the vaccine as soon as it is available.”
The President knows he has to be inoculated against COVID-19, Roque said.
“But he said it does not have to be shown to the public. He is taking the route of the British sovereign because the decision of Queen Elizabeth and her husband was to make their vaccination private,” he added.
Mr. Duterte has expressed his preference for CoronaVac or Sputnik V, the vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Russia.
The Philippines is expected to receive next month the first 50,000 doses of the 25 million doses of CoronaVac it is planning to buy.
Also expected next month is the first batch of the vaccine made by the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer. The Pfizer vaccine is the first to be granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
China is also donating 500,000 doses of CoronaVac to the Philippines, with Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian vouching on Tuesday for its safety and promoting it as “very suitable” for tropical countries.
Emergency use permit
The Department of Health (DOH), however, said any donated vaccine could not be used in the country without being granted emergency use authorization by the FDA.Sinovac has applied for emergency permit for CoronaVac with the FDA, but the regulator has found the company’s papers incomplete.
The government aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of the country’s population, this year.
The Philippines has one of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in Asia.
On Tuesday, the DOH reported 1,357 additional coronavirus infections, raising the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country to 504,804.
The DOH said 324 more patients had recovered, bringing the total number of COVID-19 survivors to 466,249. But the death toll rose to 9,978 with the deaths of 69 more patients.
The deaths and recoveries left the country with 27,857 active cases, of which 86.1 percent were mild, 6.1 percent asymptomatic, 0.42 percent moderate, 2.7 percent severe, and 4.7 percent critical.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1397525/pfizer-sinovac-deliveries-to-ph-face-more-delays,"Pfizer, Sinovac deliveries to PH face more delays",Leila B. Salaverria,2021-02-19 05:32:00,"MOCK VACCINATION About a hundred elderly people take part in a dry run of COVID-19 vaccination at Legarda Elementary School in Manila on Thursday. The practice is held in preparation for the rollout of Pfizer and Sinovac vaccines expected to arrive this month, but the deliveries will be delayed due to paperwork for indemnification required by the World Health Organization-led vaccine pool for Pfizer and by China’s requirement of emergency use authorization for Sinovac. —RICHARD A. REYES
The delivery of Pfizer and Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines to the country, scheduled for this month, is facing more delays.
Even if the Philippines has submitted the indemnification agreement required by the COVAX vaccine pool of the World Health Organization (WHO), Pfizer-BioNTech still has to submit its own indemnification agreement that also has to be signed before the delivery can start, according to WHO representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe. “What the Philippines signed is the COVAX indemnification agreement. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for an indemnification agreement coming from the manufacturer, in this case it’s Pfizer-BioNTech,” Abeyasinghe said at the televised public briefing on Thursday.Agreement not sent out
The Pfizer-BioNTech agreement has not been sent out to any of the countries involved in the early rollout, Abeyasinghe said.
He said COVAX and the GAVI vaccine alliance were working closely with Pfizer-BioNTech to make sure it would send out the indemnification agreement.
The indemnification agreement would absolve manufacturers of liability in case of adverse effects of vaccines, which have been authorized only for emergency use.
Carlito Galvez Jr., who is in charge of the government’s vaccine program, said the Philippines had signed the indemnification agreements for COVAX and the different manufacturers, and only needed Pfizer and AstraZeneca to submit their own indemnification agreements.
Galvez said there were two kinds indemnification agreements for COVAX, a generic one and a specific indemnification clause that must be signed by both the manufacturer and the Philippine government.
He noted that the delay in the delivery of vaccines from COVAX is not just in the Philippines but worldwide.
The Philippines is expecting an initial delivery of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from COVAX this month. These were supposed to arrive mid-February but were delayed, with officials citing the need to sign the indemnity agreements.
The Philippines is also awaiting the delivery of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine donated by China, but these may no longer arrive on Feb. 23 as had been expected.
Still no FDA approvalChina would deliver the vaccines to the Philippines only if the drug maker, Sinovac Biotech, got an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), according to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.
“I have received information that unless the [emergency use authorization] is delivered today, the delivery on the 23rd may be delayed,” Roque said.
But it would be better to wait for the permit so that the vaccines could be used immediately once these arrived, he said. And if the application for the permit is denied, then at least the Philippines knows it could not use the Sinovac vaccine, he added.
The FDA said it could not give a time frame for the grant of emergency use authorization to Sinovac.
“We are still evaluating their latest submissions. I can’t give a time frame until all submissions are evaluated,” FDA chief Eric Domingo told the Inquirer in a text message.
The delay triggered comparison between the Philippines and the poorer South Asian country Bangladesh, which has already started vaccinating its citizens.
But Galvez said the vaccines used in Bangladesh were donated by its neighbor India.
“We cannot inject donated vaccines without an [emergency use authorization],” he said.Despite these developments, Galvez said he believed it was still possible for the country’s vaccination drive to start this month. “Realistically, February is still possible,” he said.
The emergency use authorization for Sinovac could be issued and the COVAX vaccines could be delivered, he said. Galvez said his team would meet with officials from Pfizer Global on Friday.
Vaccines from South Korea
As for the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said his team was negotiating with AstraZeneca Philippines, expecting that the vaccines to be procured by the government and those to be donated through COVAX would be supplied by AstraZeneca Thailand.
The team, however, learned a few days ago that the vaccines would come from AstraZeneca South Korea instead.
Galvez said Serum Institute of India, which also manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine, was ready to supply the Philippines, but it was following a manufacturing system that had designated countries to supply.
“This means there is a supply problem,” he said.
Under the government’s plan, the initial rollout of the vaccines is expected in the first quarter of the year, with workers in government-run hospitals, elderly people, and uniformed personnel as the priority groups.
Some 5 million to 10 million doses are expected to arrive in the first two quarters of the year, Galvez said. The full rollout is scheduled in the third quarter, when the bulk of the vaccines is expected to be delivered.
The government aims to vaccinate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year.
Galvez also said there was still time to train vaccinators for the rollout since the vaccines would not arrive in the country at the same time.
He said he had directed local governments to prepare vaccination sites and to recruit and train people to administer the vaccines. —WITH REPORTS FROM MARICAR CINCO, PATRICIA DENISE M. CHIU AND JEROME ANING

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1393660/duterte-warns-govt-employees-dont-you-dare-delay-covid-19-vaccines,"Don’t delay flow of COVID-19 vaccines, Duterte warns gov’t workers",Gabriel Pabico Lalu,2021-02-08 23:22:00,"MANILA, Philippines —President Rodrigo Duterte issued a stern warning on Monday night to all government employees: “Do not hinder or obstruct the smooth flow [of COVID-19 vaccines], which you can see now, from the time of arrival to the time of clearance.”In his pre-recorded briefing, Duterte said people not involved in the transport and storage of the vaccines should not interfere as only the Inter-Agency Task Force against Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF) was authorized to take charge of anything related to the vaccines.
He mentioned the Bureau of Customs, saying partly in Filipino: “Your only job at Customs is to look [at the documents]. You have no business opening [the shipments].You are not allowed to do that. I am not allowing you, anybody there at the airport, to open [them].”
Duterte told Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the IATF chief implementer who oversees the vaccine procurement and the immunization program, to tap Philippine National Police (PNP) to provide escorts to help in speeding up the transport of the vaccines to local governments.
He also urged officials involved in the delivery of the vaccines from the country’s ports of entry to review their roles during dry-runs that the government would conduct.
“What they call ‘hagad’ will provide the fastest way of doing it,” he said, using a colloquial term for members of the Highway Patrol Group.
The Philippines last lagged behind its Southeast Asian neighbors in getting COVID-19 vaccines.However, the IATF assured that the vaccines would arrive soon —sometime this month to early March.
Local governments, especially those in Metro Manila, have been constantly preparing their vaccination programs so by the time that the vaccines arrive, they can efficiently administer them to their citizens.
Meanwhile, the IATF has been moving from local government to another to ensure that they would be ready for the storage, delivery, and administration of the vaccines.
Duterte reiterated that government employees should heed the orders of the IATF officials — Galvez, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.“They call the shots there — nobody else — in the matter of ensuring the smooth operation of this vaccine, reaching it to its ultimate beneficiary, the people,” Duterte stressed.
As of Monday, the Department of Health said there were over 27,000 active COVID-19 cases, with 499,772 recoveries and 11,231deaths.The government is optimistic, however, that numbers will go down as vaccinations start, moving towards attaining herd immunity by immunizing over 70 million Filipinos.

MANILA, Philippines — The first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines developed by British-Swede drugmaker AstraZeneca has arrived in the Philippines on Thursday.The plane carrying 487,200 vaccine doses from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility landed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) past 7 p.m.
It will later be towed to Villamor Air Base where government officials, including President Rodrigo Duterte, will welcome its arrival.
“I am pleased to inform you that the shipment of 487,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccines arrived tonight. After the ceremony these will immediately be delivered to storage for repackaging to prepare for immediate distribution to our frontliners,” Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, chairman of the NTF Covid-19, which is the chief implementer of all IATF resolutions.After the ceremony, the vaccines will be transported to Metropac, Marikina City.
This is the second batch of vaccines to arrive in the Philippines, following the 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses donated by the Chinese government, which arrived last Sunday, February 28.
The vaccines were initially set to arrive on March 1 but were delayed due to global supply problems.
The number of doses set to arrive was also at 525,600 but was reduced due to cargo limitations as the vaccine will be delivered using a commercial flight, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. explained.
The Philippines is expected to receive about 5.5 million to 9.2 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses this year through the COVAX facility.

“That’s why there are negotiations with the British government, China, India, and also with Russia that, if possible, they could deliver more during the first quarter,” Galvez said in Filipino.
“And we’re negotiating that, even if it becomes a bit more expensive, just as long as there’s early delivery in the second quarter and in the first quarter,” he added.
Galvez did not identify the vaccine manufacturers.
Due to the shortage of supplies for the first and second quarter of the year, Galvez said the main rollout for the Covid-19 vaccines would be in the third and fourth quarter.
The Philippines will receive 161 million doses of Covid-19 shots by the end of 2021, Galvez noted.
The government plans to start Covid-19 vaccinations as soon as the Sinovac vaccines – of which 600,000 doses were donated by the Chinese government — arrive.

MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has signed into law a measure that would expedite the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines and establish a P500-million indemnity fund, Malacañang confirmed Friday.
“We are confident that the signing of this landmark piece of legislation would expedite the procurement and administration of vaccines for the protection against Covid-19,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement.Otherwise known as the “Covid-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021,” the new law authorizes the national government, local government units (LGUs), and the private sector to procure vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the respiratory illness, through the National Task Force Against Covid-19 (NTF) and Department of Health (DOH).
It also allows LGUs to directly procure the ancillary supplies and services necessary for the storage, transport, and deployment of the vaccines.
Further, it exempts LGUs from certain provisions of existing procurement laws such as the Government Procurement Reform Act, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and the Local Government Code in their bid to obtain Covid-19 jabs.
Another salient point of the new law is the P500 million national indemnity fund to compensate any individual vaccinated against Covid-19, in case of death or for the treatment of the vaccine’s possible adverse effects.
The indemnity fund will be managed by state insurer Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and will be sourced from the contingent fund under the 2021 national budget.
According to the government, the lack of an indemnity deal earlier has delayed the delivery of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines that were initially expected to arrive in the country in mid-February.

“As of yesterday, a total of 8,559 individuals have received the first doses of the Sinovac vaccine, which were administered from March 1 to March 3 in 32 different sites in the National Capital Region,” Nograles said in an online briefing.The Philippines began its COVID-19 vaccination program after receiving 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine, CoronaVac, donated by the Chinese government.
Of the 600,000 doses, Nograles said 189,600 have already been delivered in various vaccination centers across the country.
“At this point, we acknowledge that we have countrymen who still have reservations about receiving vaccines; but we believe that our kababayan should take their cue from the doctors, nurses, and medical personnel who have received the first doses of the vaccine,” Nograles said.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said the government is eyeing to vaccinate all health workers in the country within this month.
The Philippines expects to receive on Thursday night 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines donated from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1382852/by-the-numbers-covid-19-vaccine-supplies-ph-govt-lgus-will-get,"BY THE NUMBERS: Covid-19 vaccine supplies PH gov’t, LGUs will get",Cristina Eloisa Baclig,2021-01-12 20:10:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines is set to join other nations across the world in launching a mass vaccination of citizens in the face of a continuing pandemic and emergence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes the potentially deadly respiratory illness COVID-19.
National and local governments recently released details of their respective Covid-19 vaccine acquisition projects that may come into fruition possibly within the first quarter of this year.International pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as UK’s AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac Biotech, and Covovax which is developed by US biotechnology company Novavax, have already sealed deals with the national government and local government units (LGUs).
Negotiations for vaccines developed by US-based pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Moderna, China’s Sinopharm, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute were still ongoing.
What appears to be clear for now, based on the pronouncements of National Task Force (NTF) against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. and presidential spokesman Harry Roque, is that Sinovac’s vaccine will start arriving by February and it would be the only option for Filipinos until June.

AstraZeneca
Over 30 provinces and cities have already set aside funds to buy Covid-19 vaccines. The cities of Makati, Quezon, and Taguig in Metro Manila have announced earmarking P1 billion each for the procurement. And all pledged to offer the vaccines to priority constituents for free.

Specifically, some LGUs allocated funds to procure the following number of doses from AstraZeneca:
NCRMakati City – 1,000,000 doses
Manila -City 800,000 doses
Quezon City – 750,000 doses
Valenzuela City – 640,000 doses
Caloocan City – 600,000 doses
Pasig City – 400,000 doses
Las Piñas City – 300,000 doses
Pasay City – 275,000 doses
Parañaque City – 200,000 doses
Muntinlupa City – 100,000 doses
Navotas City – 100,000 doses
LUZON
Dagupan City – 160,000 doses
Ilocos Norte – 120,000 doses
Vigan City – 100,000 to 120,000 doses
VISAYAS
Iloilo City – 600,000 doses
Ormoc City – 270,000 doses
MINDANAO
Zamboanga City – 400,000 doses
Oroquieta City – 120,000 doses
Other LGUs like Mandaluyong City, San Juan City, Taguig City, Baguio City, Bacolod City, and Davao City did not disclose the number of doses they have secured from AstraZeneca due to the nondisclosure agreement they signed with the company.
Private sector firms have also secured deals with the UK-based vaccine manufacturer via a tripartite arrangement with the national government.
First off is the agreement signed between 30 private companies, the Philippine government, and AstraZeneca for 2.6 million vaccine doses – half of which would be for its regular and contractual employees while the other half would be given to government medical front-liners.
Second is the deal between over 200 companies, the national government, and AstraZeneca for 3 million doses– half of which for its workers while the other would be donated to the national government.
Covovax
On Sunday, Galvez said the government has signed an agreement with Serum Institute of India (SII) for the supply of 30 million doses of Covovax vaccine.
He added that the number of doses is still extendible to 40 million.

Sinovac
Roque on Monday said the national government has secured from Sinovac 25 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine.
Roque also said the first batch of Sinovac vaccine or some 50,000 doses could arrive in the country by next month.
COVAX Facility
Galvez likewise detailed that there will be 40 million Covid-19 vaccine doses from the COVAX Facility, which the government eyes to administer to 22 million Filipinos.
In December 2020, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire announced that the COVAX Facility has guaranteed Covid-19 vaccine for 20 percent of the country’s population.
The COVAX Facility, also known as the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Acces Facility, is a global mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide.
It is co-led by Gavi, an international organization created to improve access to new and underused vaccines, along with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization.
The Philippines joined the COVAX Facility in July.
Additional 60 million doses
During the hearing of the Senate Committee of the Whole on January 11, Galvez disclosed a “potential” signing this week for the procurement of additional 60 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines.
“[W]e cannot disclose all the other, but we are potentially signing the term sheet of more or less another than 60 million within the week,” Galvez said.

Pfizer, Moderna, Gamaleya
As for other drug manufacturers’ vaccines, government officials said negotiations continue.
Galvez said he could not disclose yet how many doses the government is planning to procure from Pfizer but assured it’s a “very sizable amount.”
He also cited 25 million doses of Russia’s Gamaleya or Sputnik V vaccine that the government expects to obtain.
“We are still negotiating with Moderna, they are allocating us more or less 15 to 20 million dosages. The private sector under Enrique Razon already committed to help us in bringing Moderna to the Philippines,” the vaccine czar said.
“So the private sector is helping out so we can immediately lock in on the negotiation,” he added.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1397725/who-considering-3-covid-19-vaccines-in-solidarity-trials-dost,WHO considering 3 Covid-19 vaccines in solidarity trials — DOST,Cathrine Gonzales,2021-02-19 15:56:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering three Covid-19 vaccines for its solidarity trials, but the date on when this activity would commence remains uncertain, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) said Friday.“We were told that they [WHO] are down to three choices of vaccines and we will know soon kung kailan po mag-uumpisa itong trials [when the trials would start],” DOST Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara said in an online press briefing, but did not disclose which vaccines are being considered by the WHO.
According to Guevara, the occurrence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and other factors in the vaccines have contributed to the delay in the conduct of solidarity trials.
She said the country’s team for the solitary trials is ready and has been preparing for the activity since September last year.
“We have been in touch with the WHO solidarity vaccine trials global lead and we were informed that the vaccine selection from their end still has to be finalized,” she added.
“Malaki ang naging epekto kasi nitong paglabas ng variants at nakita din nila ‘yung mahirap kapag double dose ang ating mga vaccines [The occurrence of variants had a large effect and they saw that using double dose vaccines would be difficult], so they are trying to find better alternatives to the vaccines that are available,” she added.
As for preparations for the trials in the Philippines, Guevara said one of the challenges is the increased requirement in the number of staff for the initiative due to the increased number of trial sites and participants.
She noted that Covid-19 cases in Metro Manila are also changing, causing difficulty in identifying the final list of trial sites.
“The study vaccines are not yet released by the WHO including the final trial protocols and standard operating procedures, causing delay in the implementation of the trial,” she added.
Currently, available Covid-19 vaccines are only being administered through emergency use authorization (EUA), which allows the limited use of vaccines that are deemed safe and effective based on review of interim data of Phase 3 clinical trials.Guevara reiterated that the EUA is different from a product registration, which is being issued for new and approved vaccines that were proven safe and effective based on review of complete data from Phase 3 trials.
Outside the WHO solidarity trials, there are also vaccine manufacturers that have applied to conduct their independent clinical trials in the Philippines.
Guevara said Belgium-based Janssen Pharmaceuticals has already started its phase 3 clinical trials in the country, while trial site preparations are ongoing for Chinese firms Clover Biopharmaceuticals and Sinovac Biotech.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines is aiming to purchase some 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and inoculate at least 50 million Filipinos in 2021, National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Wednesday.
But Galvez noted that it would still depend on the global supply, noting that developed countries already secured 80 percent of the vaccines worldwide.“Based on our current negotiations, we will be able to purchase at least 148 million doses from more or less seven manufacturers. However, it will be dependent on the global supply,” Galvez said in a televised briefing.
“Sa ilalim po ng Philippine National Vaccine roadmap, babakunahan po natin ang humigit kumulang 50 to 70 million na Filipino sa loob ng taong ito [we will vaccinate more or less 50 to 70 million Filipinos within the year],” he added.
Galvez said the Philippines is already in “advanced stages of negotiations” with pharmaceutical companiesNovavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Sinovac and Gamaleya.
“We hope to close the deal with these companies this month,” he said.
Apart from these negotiations, Galvez said the Philippines is guaranteed to receive COVID-19 vaccines for 22 million Filipinos from the Covax Facility.

MANILA, Philippines — Sinovac will deliver “sooner” the 600,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine that the Chinese government has promised to donate to the Philippines, the drugmaker’s general manager said Wednesday.
“Actually, the products [are] already there, we are managing the procedures of making the delivery and we will expect Philippines will be one of the important countries we’re going to supply the products,” Sinovac general manager Helen Yang said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel when asked when its vaccines will be delivered to the country.Yang did not state a specific date for the vaccines’ arrival, though she said “it will be soon.”
“We’re working very hard in order to make it happen. We’ll try our best. We will do it sooner,” Yang said.
On Monday, Sinovac’s vaccine secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA, however, did not advise Sinovac’s vaccine to be administered on senior citizens and health workers treating Covid-19 patients.
The country’s National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), a group of medical experts, is said to be discussing the prioritization scheme on vaccination considering FDA’s recommendation.

Galvez did not identify the vaccine manufacturers that are involved in supplying the Philippines with the Covid-19 vaccines.
But previously, the government already announced having secured vaccines from China’s Sinovac, British drugmaker AstraZeneca, U.S. companies Pfizer and Moderna, and the Serum Institute of India.
“All in all, by this February, second week, we’re trying to come up with the supply agreements with the vaccine manufacturers and we will also include the two remaining contracts we are negotiating,” said Galvez.
“We are expecting up to 146 to 148 million doses. This is excluding the COVAX [facility where] we are assured to have more or less 40 million doses,” he added.
The Philippines is expecting to receive at least 5.6 million Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca within the first quarter of the year, Galvez said.
Some 50,000 Covid-19 vaccines from Sinovac are also expected to arrive this February.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1401679/cavite-allots-p750-m-for-covid-19-vaccines,Cavite allots P750 million for COVID-19 vaccines,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,2021-03-02 00:12:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Cavite provincial government has allotted P750 million for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for its more than 1.5 million residents, Gov. Jonvic Remulla said in a Facebook post on Monday.
Remulla said provincial officials had started talks with British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca over its COVID-19 vaccine, which would be for those aged 18 to 59 years old.“Astra Zeneca is proven 60-91% effective in preventing COVID-19,” Remulla said in his post.
According to him, they are waiting for a response from American pharmaceutical firms Moderna and Pfizer about buying vaccines suitable for senior citizens — that is, those aged 60 and above.
Previously, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines might be delayed for about a week due to supply problems.
However, the initial batch of AstraZeneca vaccines came from the first round of allocated doses from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility. This would include 525,600 doses of COVID-19 vaccines.
Other vaccines that local government units procured separately from the national government will come later.
The Philippines started vaccinating government health workers and other frontliners on Monday, a day after the arrival of the Chinese government-donated COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac Biotech.Among the first to get inoculated were Philippine General Hospital Director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director-General Eric Domingo, and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos.
The government aims to vaccinate 70 million Filipinos in a bid to achieve herd immunity — that is, when a big enough percentage of the population becomes immune from the virus, either through vaccination or prior infection.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1399844/only-19-of-adult-pinoys-ok-with-getting-covid-19-vaccines-46-not-willing,46% of adult Filipinos unwilling to get COVID-19 vaccine; only 19% willing,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,2021-02-25 00:58:00,"MANILA, Philippines —Only 19 percent of adult Filipinos are willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 46 percent are unwilling even if a safe and effective vaccine is available.
This is the finding of a survey done by OCTA Research, a group of top academicians studying the coronavirus pandemic.According to the survey, the intent to get vaccines is lowest among respondents in Balance Luzon, which is at 14 percent, followed by the Visayas at 20 percent, Metro Manila at 25 percent, and Mindanao at 26 percent.
Meanwhile, the number of those who would reject COVID-19 vaccination is highest in Balance Luzon and the Visayas at 47 percent, followed by Mindanao and Metro Manila at 43 percent each.
Roughly a third, or 35 percent, were undecided if they would get vaccinated. Most of these were in Balance Luzon at 39 percent, followed by Metro Manila at 31 percent, the Visayas at 33 percent, and Mindanao at 32 percent.
The top reason for not getting the vaccine, given by 73 percent of respondents, was a concern for the safety of the vaccines, followed by doubt about their efficacy.
Concern for vaccine safety was higher in Mindanao at 78 percent and in Balance Luzon at 76 percent, compared to Metro Manila at 69 percent and in the Visayas at 64 percent.
One alarming figure that the study found out is that 9 percent do not want to get the vaccine because they believe it is not needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
The two other reasons for not wanting to get vaccinated were “the vaccine is not free,” given by 6 percent of respondents, and “the vaccine is expensive,” given by 6 percent.
The OCTA Research survey shows little variance between various socioeconomic classes’ in their sentiments towards the COVID-19 vaccine. Those willing to get vaccinated are 23 percent in Classes A, B, and C; 18 percent in Class D; and 23 percent in Class E.
Those unwilling to get vaccinated are 45 percent in Classes A, B, and C; 46 percent in Class D; 44 percent in Class E.This is not the first survey on COVID-19 vaccination conducted by OCTA Research. Last January, the group released another study saying that only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents would want to get vaccinated.
Aside from issues with COVID-19 vaccine procurement, the government is always questioned about its efforts to disseminate proper information about vaccines while assuring the public about its safety and efficacy.
In a radio interview last January, Vice President Leni Robredo said that the government must craft an efficient communication plan that would clear up concerns with the COVID-19 vaccines.
While Malacañang rebuked Robredo for her suggestions — saying that these were already being carried out — the Vice President’s camp questioned why surveys done by different polling firms indicated low appreciation for COVID-19 vaccines.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1367283/duterte-grants-fda-authority-to-issue-emergency-use-of-covid-19-vaccines,Duterte grants FDA authority to issue emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines,Krissy Aguilar,2020-12-02 15:43:00,"MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has allowed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to grant emergency use authorization (EUA) to expected COVID-19 vaccines that will be made available in the Philippines.
In Executive Order No. 121 signed Dec. 1 and made public Wednesday, Duterte authorized the FDA director-general to issue a EUA to COVID-19 drugs or vaccines.The President also authorized the FDA director-general to “accept the regulatory decision of the [World Health Organization], [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], or other internationally recognized regulatory authorities.
With the FDA allowed to issue EUAs, the process of approving COVID-19 vaccines will be shortened from six months to 21 days.
According to the EO, conditions for the issuance of EUA to COVID-19 drug or vaccine are the following:
Based on the totality of evidence available, including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose or treat COVID-19;
The known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine when used to diagnose, prevent or treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug or vaccine if any; and
There is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the drug or vaccine for diagnosing, preventing or treating COVID-19
Earlier, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III asked the President to grant the FDA with EUA to “cut the red tape.”
Pfizer and Moderna are among the pharmaceutical firms who already applied for an EUA of their COVID-19 vaccines before U.S. health regulators.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 vaccines of China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute have already secured EUA from their respective governments.

MANILA, Philippines — If reports turn out true, Malacañang said Monday it is “good” that some 100,000 Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (Pogo) workers in the Philippines were already vaccinated against COVID-19 as this means there are now less possible carriers of the virus.
“Wala po akong impormasyon. Kung totoo man, eh ‘di mabuti. [So] 100,000 less possible carriers of the COVID-19,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in an online Palace briefing when sought to comment on the matter.(I don’t have any information. But if it is true, then good. [There will be] 100,000 less possible carriers of the COVID-19.)
“Regarding the 100,000, unless they came back to China and had the vaccination here in China as to whether they were brought out of China, I cannot confirm or deny. I certainly don’t know,” Philippine Ambassador to China Jose “Chito” Sta. Romana said in the same briefing.
Chinese Filipino civic leader Teresita Ang See reportedly bared that some 100,000 Pogo workers in the Philippines have been inoculated against COVID-19.
This, despite the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given no approval yet on any vaccine.
Meanwhile, the FDA already launched an investigation on the vaccination of some government officials, members of the Presidential Security Group and other military men.
The National Bureau of Investigation was also ordered to look into the possible smuggling of unregistered COVID-19 vaccines in the country.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1389022/covid-19-vaccines-dont-cause-infertility-say-yale-professor-student,"Covid-19 vaccines don’t cause infertility, say Yale professor, student",Cristina Eloisa Baclig,2021-01-27 19:23:00,"MANILA, Philippines — As the country starts to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines, some myths and fears with the immunization shot still linger.
Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr., in a televised meeting on Tuesday, also cited the misinformation posted on social media by “anti-vaxxers” (people who disagree with the use of vaccines for a variety of reasons) as one of the causes of low confidence among Filipinos with receiving jabs of the incoming doses of vaccines.“This is a problem that needs to be addressed. We know that you will be of great help because the willingness of our countrymen to get vaccinated is decreasing due to the adverse effects of certain brands,” Galvez said, speaking in Filipino.
“At the same time, anti-vaxxers have a strong social media presence. This is a big challenge,” he added.
The Philippines is not the only country that is experiencing this. Anti-vaxxers are also a huge problem in the United States, especially now that they have started their inoculation campaign with batches of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccines.
In a New York Times article published on Tuesday, Akiko Iwasaki, Waldemar von Zedtwitz Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, and Yale M.D.-Ph.D student Alice Lu-Culligan debunked a specific rumor — which they believe discourages women to get vaccinated against Covid-19.
Myth: Covid-19 vaccines can make women infertile
According to Iwasaki and Culligan, the rumor claims that certain vaccines can cause infertility “by generating antibodies that not only target the coronavirus spike protein, as designed, but also inadvertently react with a protein in the placenta called syncytin-1.”
The vaccines’ antibodies, according to rumors, can attack the syncytin-1 and affect the development of the placenta because the coronavirus spike protein allegedly has a similar structure to the human protein.
Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna uses mRNA, a genetic molecule that carries the instructions for making proteins in our body, to instruct cells to make a harmless spike protein similar to those of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These spikes and spike fragments in the cells will be recognized by the immune system and cause an immune response that produces antibodies that hinders the virus from attacking other cells.
Explainer: Facts about 7 COVID-19 vaccines Philippines may getIwasaki and Culligan said that the “confusion is understandable,” since the US pharmaceutical companies Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna did not include research on pregnant and lactating women during their clinical trials.
“But the valid concerns about this information void have been eclipsed by targeted misinformation campaigns led by vaccine skeptics who are weaponizing women’s health issues to advance their agenda. These falsehoods are being spread to amplify our legitimate anxieties and undermine trust in vaccination,” they added.
Fact: Covid-19 vaccines are non-evasive to pregnant women
An analysis by the Yale professor and student found that there was no similarity between the viral spikes and the placental protein. They also noted that there have been no official and scientific reports yet citing Covid-19 vaccines as a cause for infertility.
In fact, they stated that some women were still able to get pregnant after receiving jabs of Covid-19 vaccines — either after contracting the disease or during the clinical trials of the vaccines.
Both Iwasaki and Culligan added that the vaccines might also benefit both the lactating mother and the infant. They also quashed the myth that pregnant women and their baby can get Covid-19 from the vaccines.
“[V]accines induce protective immune responses in the mother, creating antibodies that are passed to infants via breast milk and serve to protect them,” they said in the article.“[I]t is unlikely that the vaccine can cross into breast milk. Even if they did, they would not pose a threat to the health of a nursing baby; if ingested, these components would be digested and degraded in the gastrointestinal tract,” they added.
However, they emphasized that the Covid-19 can indeed make pregnant women more susceptible to severe illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the dreaded disease can increase the risk of preterm labor (which means that the baby might be delivered too early or before the 37 weeks of pregnancy is completed.)
“For any woman who is pregnant, nursing or trying to conceive, contracting Covid-19 is almost certainly more dangerous than getting immunized. And ultimately, mass vaccination, combined with physical distancing and wearing masks, provides the only way that we can end the pandemic and protect all women, men and children from the disease,” Iwasaki and Culligan said.
Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine in PH
The Philippines’ vaccine czar said the country might be able to acquire and rollout Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech by February via the COVAX Facility.
Last week, Galvez announced that there will be at least 40 million doses from the COVAX Facility. But, contrary to his earlier statement, he stated that the coming vaccines might be manufactured either by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, COVAVAX of the Serum Institute of India, or Johnson & Johnson.

MANILA, Philippines — Some 38,400 doses of vaccines developed by British-Swede pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, the National Task Force against COVID-19 said.
These vaccines were from the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX facility, a global vaccine pool that ensures equitable access to COVID-19 jabs in developing countries.The additional AstraZeneca vaccines are part of the 525,600 doses promised by the COVAX facility to the Philippines.
But on March 4, only 487,200 doses arrived in the country.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had explained this was due to the cargo limitations as the vaccines were transported via a commercial flight.
The Philippines is expecting to receive at least 5.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility in the first quarter of the year.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. signed the term sheet on behalf of the government. The vaccines will be available starting the third quarter of 2021.SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has partnered with Novavax, a U.S.-based biotechnology company for the development and commercialization of its Covovax vaccine.
Covovax is in third-stage trials and expected to be approved for use by international regulators.
“The vaccine will be used to vaccinate 15 million vulnerable and poor Filipinos. The vaccine is stable at 2°C to 8°C, the standard temperature that is within the existing cold chain system in the Philippines, thus allowing its distribution to the remotest barangays,” said Dr. Luningning Villa, medical director of Faberco Life Sciences Inc., SII’s Philippine partner.
The price of the vaccine is expected to be finalized soon between the government and SII.
So far, the Philippines has secured 2.6 million doses of vaccine from British drugmaker AstraZeneca through a tripartite agreement with local private firms. The vaccines are expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021.
The government is also in talks with other drugmakers such as Pfizer and Moderna of the United States, Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm of China, and the Gamaleya Institute of Russia.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1393695/1st-batch-of-vaccines-in-ph-next-week,First batch of vaccines in PH next week,Jerome Aning,2021-02-09 05:01:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The initial batch of COVID-19 vaccines from the global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX is expected to arrive in the country by mid-February, Malacañang said on Monday as it gave an assurance that the government would be ready to launch its vaccination drive next week.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the government expected to hear from COVAX any time now on the exact date of the vaccines’ delivery, and said all preparations were in place once these arrived in the country.“The COVAX facility said it will arrive mid-February and as far as we’re concerned, as you can see from the report of the mayors, we are ready to begin the vaccination and we are ready to do it by Feb. 15,” Roque said at a press briefing.
He said the Philippines would be given notice of the impending delivery two to three days before the vaccines are loaded in the aircraft so that it would have time to prepare to receive these at the airport.
Initially from Pfizer
The initial shipment from the global procurement pool would be 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which would require subzero temperatures for storage, he said.
They would be kept in the Department of Health (DOH) warehouse before being distributed to COVID-19 referral hospitals, he said.
He also said Pfizer would be responsible for bringing the vaccines to the areas where these would be used.
President Rodrigo Duterte, who earlier expressed preference for the Chinese or Russian vaccine, will be given priority in the vaccination because he is a senior citizen, Roque said.
It is also important for him to get the shot to inspire public confidence, he said.
“We expect him to be among the first. Whether it is done publicly or privately will be his decision,” he said.
The DOH on Monday said local governments in Metro Manila and metropolitan Cebu and Davao must have set up their vaccination operation centers by Feb. 10.Speaking at an online briefing, Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje, who is in charge of the DOH public health service team, said the centers would be in charge of the vaccine rollout in local areas with contingency measures in place to address any problem.
“They will help us see the entirety to the implementation of the vaccine rollout. There will be planning, policy [awareness], dissemination of guidelines—there will just be one source of our information. There will be logistics [employees] who will be in charge of the vaccines, if the ancillaries are there,” Cabotaje said.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson
MANILA, Philippines — The national government has announced that it is already prepared for the expected rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in the country this month.
The government has also recently approved and ratified its plan for mass immunization against Covid-19. The detailed list of the priority population for the scheduled inoculation has also been released last week.While it seems like everything is underway for the country’s vaccination program, several doctors and medical experts clarified that there is a certain group of individuals who are not advised to receive jabs of Covid-19 vaccines.
Who should not receive shots of the Covid-19 vaccine?
According to Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, a pediatric infectious disease expert and Department of Health (DOH) technical advisory group member, there is currently only one contraindication to Covid-19 vaccination.
“Currently yung nag-iisang contraindication is yung anaphylaxis or a severe allergy to a previous dose,” Lim said in an online briefing on Monday, explaining that those who will experience this contraindication will not be allowed to take further doses of Covid-19 vaccine.
(Currently, the only contraindication is anaphylaxis or a severe allergy to a previous dose of Covid-19 vaccine.)
The guidelines set by the Philippine Society of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (PSAAI) stated that: “Patients who have experienced an immediate allergic reaction, whether mild (e.g.rashes) or severe (e. g. anaphylaxis) to Covid-19 vaccine after the first dose should not receive the second dose.”
“Patients who have a history of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to certain vaccine excipients such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) (which can also be found in colonoscopy preparation, or laxatives) or to polysorbate (which can be found in vascular graft materials, surgical gels, PEGylated medications) should not receive the Covid-19 vaccines.”
The persons mentioned by PSAAI, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), should not receive vaccine shots either from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, since PEG is a component of the mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine.
The patients are also advised by PSAAI to be referred to an allergist for further evaluation.
“Patients who have experienced an immediate allergic reaction, such as urticaria, angioedema, difficulty of breathing, regardless of severity, to any OTHER vaccine or
injected therapy must be evaluated by an allergist to assess possible allergic reactions to PEG or polysorbate. All vaccinated patients should be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination,” PSAAI added.“Wala pa naman tayong nababakunahan so di natin masasabi,” said Dr. Carmela Kasala of the Philippine Pediatric Society, adding that it is crucial to monitor for any adverse effects following the first round of Covdi-19 vaccination in the country.
(We have yet to start vaccinating people so it is hard to say.)
“Yung mga on the second round natin kung nag react siya sa unang vaccine na binigay sa kanya, ‘di na po pwede ibigay yung pangalawang shot kasi baka maging fatal pa yung mangyari but this is very rare,” Kasala added.
(During the second round of vaccination, if the person severely reacted to the first dose, he/she can not get the second dose or shot because it might become fatal — although that kind of situation is very rare.)
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) enumerated the following conditions that may disqualify a person from getting the coronavirus vaccine, specifically the Pfizer-BioNTech product:
extreme allergic reactions
pregnant and breastfeeding women
children
Can immunocompromised persons get Covid-19 vaccines?
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Friday said that immunocompromised individuals cannot receive jabs of Covid-19 vaccine due to adverse effects.
“‘Yong mga immunocompromised, ‘yong kanilang immune system na mahina o may tama, ay hindi natin pwedeng bigyan ng bakuna,” he told reporters in an ambush interview.
(Immunocompromised individuals, those whose immune systems are either weak or have taken a hit we cannot give them vaccines.)
Duque cited previous reports that some elderly people with underlying health conditions in Norway have died after getting inoculated with vaccine from the PfizerBioNTech.
However, according to the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), a committee which acts as a scientific and clinical advisory body to the WHO, there is no evidence yet linking the reported deaths of elderly people and PfizerBioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine.
“The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of BNT162b2,” GACVS said in a statement last month.
“Reports are in line with the expected, all-cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub-population of frail, elderly individuals, and the available information does not confirm a contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events,” the committee added.
Health reform advocate Dr. Tony Leachon and kidney specialist Dr. Carlo Trinidad also disputed what they described as an “irresponsible” and “misleading” statement by Duque.
“Sec. Duque should rectify and qualify this misleading information. We will deprive the people who will surely benefit from vaccination,” Leachon said in a Twitter post on Friday.
“I think [Duque is] confused or tired. Perhaps he must consult his vaccine expert panel.As long as these are not live attenuated vaccines, they hold no specific risk to an immunocompromised patient, other than any factors specific to the individual that could be a contraindication,” Leachon said in a separate Tweet.
Meanwhile, according to Trinidad, “Pfizer trials included patients with baseline comorbidities such as those with CANCER, AIDS, DIABETES, LEUKEMIA, LIVER DISEASE.”
Based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), Covid-19 vaccines that use mRNAs such as PfizerBioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are “unlikely to pose a safety risk” for transplant patients since it is not a live vaccine.
“[B]ecause immunocompromised people may be at risk for severe COVID-19, CDC recommends these groups may still receive the vaccine if there are no contraindications,” the US-based medical association explained on its website.
“Transplant recipients should be counseled that the effectiveness and safety profile of these vaccines for them are not currently known,” IDSA added.
On the other hand, oncology patients, which IDSA said “many of whom are immunocompromised either by virtue of their disease of cancer or their treatment, e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplant,” can also get Covid-19 vaccines if they have no contraindications to vaccination.
However, since there are still limited data on the vaccines’ safety profile and efficacy in immunocompromised populations, IDSA suggested counseling patients before taking vaccine shots for Covid-19.
IDSA likewise clarified that patients with autoimmune diseases can be inoculated against Covid-19.
“Autoimmune disease is not a contraindication for the mRNA vaccines. The study populations for both mRNA vaccine trials included participants with autoimmune disease.”
“No imbalances were observed in the occurrence of symptoms consistent with autoimmune conditions or inflammatory disorders in clinical trial participants who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine compared to placebo.”
What about other allergic reactions and conditions?
CDC said those who have a food allergy, pet allergy, environmental allergies, and allergies to oral medications (including the oral equivalents of injectable medications) can and should get Covid-19 vaccine shots.
The agency explained that allergic reactions “not related to vaccines, injectable therapies, components of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines (including PEG), or polysorbates” are not considered a contraindication or precaution to Covid-19 vaccination.
“Hindi po totoo na contraindication kung may mag allergies kayo o asthma o may food allergy or drug allergy, hindi po totoo na hindi niyo pwedeng ma-receive ang bakuna. Pwede po [kayo mabakunahan],” Kasala emphasized.
(It is not true that yous should not get Covid-19 vaccine if you have allergies, asthma, food allergy, or drug allergy. You can still get vaccinated.)
“‘Wag po matakot. Isipin natin mas maraming benepisyo sa paglagay sa bakuna kesa sa wala tayong bakuna,” she added.
(Do not be afraid. Just think about it, there are more benefits in receiving Covid-19 vaccines than having none.)
Also included in PSAAI’s “special group” who can receive Covid-19 vaccines are:
Patients with allergic reactions (of any severity) to food, inhalant/environmental allergens, insects, latex, oral medications, not related to vaccines and their components, can receive Covid-19 vaccines.
Patients with immunodeficiency and autoimmune disease (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Bell’s palsy) may also get vaccinated but they should be informed that there is still not enough data available to establish vaccine safety and efficacy in these conditions.
Patients with well-controlled asthma and on inhaled corticosteroids, and those with allergic rhinitis on intranasal corticosteroids can receive the Covid-19 vaccine.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1398130/dost-appeals-for-more-vaccine-trial-volunteers,DOST appeals for more COVID-19 vaccine trial volunteers,Leila B. Salaverria,2021-02-21 05:18:00,"The government is calling on Filipinos to take part in clinical trials, especially one that is already ongoing and two others that are set to start soon, as a way of helping produce an effective vaccine for COVID-19.
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which is based in Belgium and owned by Johnson & Johnson, has started its clinical trial in the Philippines for its single-shot vaccine.Two Chinese companies, Sinovac Biotech and Clover Biopharmaceutical, are in the final stages of preparations for their trials in the country.
“We encourage our countrymen to join clinical trials if your barangay is chosen as one of the sites of the clinical trial, because we need to find a vaccine that is effective and safe and efficacious,” said Undersecretary Rowena Guevara of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
At the moment, Janssen is recruiting and screening participants, said Guevara.
Those who would pass the screening would be given the vaccines and their condition would be monitored, she said.
Adverse effects
In case of adverse effects in independent clinical trials, the vaccine developers would shoulder the cost of treatment, she said.
In the case of the World Health Organization (WHO) solidarity trial, the WHO would provide global insurance to the volunteers.
The Philippine government would not shoulder any of the costs, Guevara added.
The DOST earlier said Janssen would likely conduct trials in the cities of San Pablo and Cabuyao in Laguna province, La Paz in Iloilo province, and Metro Manila.
Johnson & Johnson said Janssen’s vaccine was found to be 72-percent effective in its United States trials.The company also said the vaccine was “85-percent effective overall in preventing severe disease and demonstrated complete protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death as of Day 28.”
Janssen’s vaccine is a single shot unlike the vaccines produced by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which require two jabs to be fully effective.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on Saturday said the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines was due to their requirement of a government assurance that they would not be hailed to court in the same way that Sanofi Pasteur was following the Dengvaxia fiasco.
Indemnification fund
“All of us are getting impatient. But the manufacturers, Pfizer, Astrazeneca, became afraid and want to have assurance that what happened to Dengvaxia would not happen to them, when the manufacturer of that vaccine was sued,” Roque said during his appearance at a television noontime show.
Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. on Thursday said that it already had an indemnification agreement with AstraZeneca.
“For the information of everyone, in our initial negotiations, Pfizer wasn’t asking for that, just only now, that’s why we were a bit surprised because the only one that insisted on what we call indemnity clause was Johnson & Johnson,” Galvez said.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Saturday said the passage of a law creating an indemnification fund would speed up negotiations for COVID-19 vaccines.
Vergeire said the indemnification agreement with vaccine manufacturers was the main challenge for the country at the moment.
Urgent measure
President Duterte certified as urgent the measure to create an indemnity fund to help those who would experience adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccines.
Speaker Lord Allan Velasco has committed passage on Monday of his House Bill No. 8648, which provides, among others, an indemnification fund.
Vergeire explained that all drug manufacturers required an indemnification agreement because the vaccines were still under development, and they would not want any liability for their emergency use.
Other countries already have existing laws for indemnification, she noted.
“The reason we are having more difficulty in negotiation is because we do not have a law to support this indemnification agreement. This is why we are urging Congress to approve this law so that the negotiations would move more quickly,” Vergeire said at Saturday’s Laging Handa briefing.
Informed consent
But while the law is not yet in place, she said the Philippines negotiated with vaccine manufacturers to come up with specific documents to address their concerns, such as the informed consent form that would include the liability waiver statement.
“We are ensuring [to] them that no liability will be charged against them in case there would be adverse events,” she added.
Once the indemnification agreement has been ironed out, and especially if the indemnification fund law has been passed, negotiations with vaccine manufacturers and with the COVAX facility would move swiftly, Vergeire said.
“And that would facilitate the arrival of the vaccines into the country,” she added.
Vergeire also said the Dengvaxia issue was “beside the point.”

“We have money, but it’s in the bank. The problem is that rich countries bought all the supplies. There’s a scramble [for vaccines] now,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino.According to him, procurement laws have not made it easy for the country to get vaccines, as the government could not“play” with public funds.
But he said that Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the chief implementor of the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, had already talked with the Chinese firm — that is Sinovac Biotech — from which the government would buy vaccines.
In September, Duterte slammed pharmaceutical companies, particularly those in Western countries, for asking for advance payment for COVID-19 vaccines still under development.
In November, he changed his mind, allowing concerned government agencies to enter into advance market commitments with private vaccine developers and make advance payments.

These areas are Metro Manila, the Cordillera Administrative Region, Calabarzon, Davao Region, and Cebu City, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in an online Palace briefing.“Natukoy na natin ang priority eligible population and areas for COVID-19 vaccination. Una, ‘yung mga matataas na lugar kung saan maraming COVID,” he said.
(We identified the priority eligible population and areas for the COVID-19 vaccine. First are the areas with the many cases of COVID-19.)
In terms of sectors, the priority for vaccination is health care workers, uniformed personnel, and indigent citizens.
The Philippines is eyeing to procure some 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to inoculate 50 to 70 million Filipinos in 2021.
So far, the government has signed deals with China’s Sinovac, the Serum Institute of India, and British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

https://business.inquirer.net/318309/adb-poor-infrastructure-seen-to-slow-covid-19-vaccination-in-rural-ph,ADB: Poor infrastructure seen to slow Covid-19 vaccination in rural PH,Ben O. de Vera,2021-02-23 15:44:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Poor infrastructure and the lack of cold storage facilities in the countryside would slow down the Philippines’ vaccination program, which targets to inoculate the entire population by 2023, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Tuesday.
Citing earlier projections from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), ADB said in a report that it would take the Philippines up to the fourth quarter of 2023 to finish vaccinating the rest of its population after prioritizing vulnerable groups.Compared to other Asean countries, vaccination rollout in the Philippines would lag behind Singapore’s plan to finish inoculation by the fourth quarter of this year, Vietnam’s by the second quarter of next year, Brunei Darussalam and Thailand in the third quarter of 2022, Malaysia in the second quarter of 2023, and Indonesia by the third quarter of 2023.
The Philippines’ timetable to vaccinate the entire population was the same as in Bangladesh, Nepal, Samoa, and Tonga.
A picture shows the logo of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) displayed outside its headquarters in Manila on September 2, 2010. AFP FILE PHOTO/TED ALJIBE
Poorer Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste may take up to 2024 or beyond to vaccinate all of their respective populations.
“In the Philippines, it is difficult to access rural and remote communities due to unpredictable weather, security concerns, and poor infrastructure. Inadequate provision of transportation has seen health care workers resort to hiring private motorcycles and pump boats to deliver and administer vaccines,” the ADB brief titled “Getting Ready for the COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout” read.
“Refrigerators in health centers in rural areas are subject to intermittent power supply with no backup power source. Vaccine wastage also occurs owing to a lack of skilled personnel,” it added.
Citing 2020 data by logistics firm DHL, ADB said cold chain logistics in the Philippines scored four out of five as the highest score in terms of preparedness for facilities that required conventional temperature requirements or about 2-8 degrees Celsius, which AstraZeneca vaccines, for instance, needed as storage temperature.
But in case vaccines needed stringent temperature requirements of as low as negative 80 degrees Celsius, cold chain facilities in the Philippines scored only two out of five. Pfizer vaccines, in particular, need to be stored at as low as negative 70 degrees Celsius.
In an earlier report, ADB said the Philippines faced constraints in vaccine financing as “the government estimates that P82.5 billion (about $1.7 billion) will be required to provide vaccines to approximately 55 percent of the country’s population—still short of its plan to vaccinate all Filipinos by 2023.”
Citing the vaccine allocation plan prepared by the Department of Health (DOH), ADB had said the Philippine government targeted to vaccinate 25.35 million Filipinos in 2021, 44.63 million in 2022, and 41.77 million in 2023 since by that time the Philippines would have a total population of 112.89 million.To help buy vaccines, ADB earlier realigned $25 million out of its $125-million health system enhancement to address and limit (Heal) COVID-19 project loan extended in August last year so the Philippines can settle $50 million in advance payments in January this year for six vaccine supply agreements.
In all, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) last December released to DOH P2.76 billion or $55 million from two earlier loans renegotiated with the ADB and the World Bank.
Together with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which would chip-in $300 million, the ADB’s $400-million contribution to the second health system enhancement to address and limit Covid-19 (Heal 2) will finance the bulk of the $764.17-million project cost mainly to procure Covid-19 vaccines, the Inquirer reported last week.
Together with the forthcoming World Bank loan amounting to $500 million, the three multilateral lenders would inject a total of $1.2 billion into the Philippines’ nationwide vaccination program upon approval by their respective boards all expected in March.

MANILA, Philippines — Apart from China’s Sinovac, the Philippines is also eyeing to roll out in February Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine via the COVAX facility, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Tuesday.
“Baka mauna ang Pfizer because the COVAX facility will be deploying the early rollout of Pfizer so iintayin din namin ‘yun sa February,” Galvez said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel.(Pfizer might be first because the COVAX facility will be deploying the early rollout of Pfizer so we’re waiting for that this February.)
Galvez said they are meeting with the COVAX facility this morning to apply for its scheduled early rollout next month.
The COVAX facility is a platform that aims to ensure rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for people in all countries.
The COVAX facility already guaranteed COVID-19 vaccines for 20 percent of the Philippines’ population, the Department of Health said.
Earlier, the country already secured 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac.
Some 50,000 doses of this vaccine will arrive in the country also by February.

“Mayroon pong dalawang klase ng bakuna (There are two types of vaccines) that can be available by February already,” she added.

Vergeire, however, refused to divulge more information on the vaccines.
“Antayin po natin si (Let us wait for information from our) vaccine czar. I hope you understand he is the one authorized to provide this kind of information,” she said, referring to Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who is also the chief implementer of the government’s national action plan on the pandemic.The Philippines earlier signed a deal with the Serum Institute of India for 30 million doses of the Covovax COVID-19 vaccine.
The vaccines will be available by the third quarter of 2021.
The country has also secured 2.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca through a tripartite agreement with local private firms.
The vaccines are expected to arrive by the second quarter of the year.
Some local government units have also signed agreements with the national government and AstraZeneca for the supply of the inoculation shots.
The government is likewise in talks with other vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna of the United States, Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm of China, and the Gamaleya Institute of Russia for the vaccination program.RELATED STORY:

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1385899/ibp-says-there-is-legal-basis-in-public-outcry-for-covid-19-vaccine-prices,Public has legal basis to demand disclosure of COVID-19 vaccine prices,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,2021-01-20 03:35:00,"MANILA, Philippines — There’s a “compelling legal basis” to grant the people’s request for the publication of COVID-19 vaccine prices even in the face of a pandemic, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) said in a statement issued on Monday.
“Transparency is helpful in establishing facts, dispelling doubts and suspicions, countering propaganda, minimizing political posturing, curbing corruption, promoting accountability, nurturing cooperation, and in enhancing trust in our country’s governance,” Domingo Cayosa, IBP national president, said.“It is good to let the people know more about the COVID 19 vaccines, the decisions to be made for them, and the public funds therefor.A well-informed citizenry will ‘heal as one,’ BETTER and FASTER,” he added.
According to Cayosa, Constitution has two provisions that mandate the government to make full public disclosure in transactions that involves the public interest — in this case, vaccines against a pandemic.
These provisions are Article II in Section 28 and Ariticle III in Section 7.
Cayosa cited a case between former Solicitor General Francisco Chavez and the National Housing Authority which the Supreme Court decided citing those provisions.
Quoting the decision, Cayosa said: ‘These provisions of the Constitution seek to promote transparency in policy-making and in the operations of the government, as well as provide the people sufficient information to exercise effectively other constitutional rights.”
But Cayosa also mentioned that Executive Order No, 2 — signed by President Rodrigo Duterte himself — which provides a legal presumption favoring access to information.
“Executive Order No. 2 which was signed by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on July 23, 2016 provides that ‘There shall be a legal presumption in favor of access to information, public records and official records’,” Cayosa said.
“The Freedom of Information E.O. acknowledges that ‘the incorporation of this right in the Constitution is a recognition of the fundamental role of free and open exchange of information in a democracy, meant to enhance transparency and accountability in government official acts, transactions, or decisions’.It states that ‘the Executive Branch recognizes the urgent need to operationalize these Constitutional provisions’,” he added.
Secretary Carllito Galvez Jr., vaccine czar and chief implementor of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), and other government officials have maintained that they could not divulge prices of the CoronaVac — the vaccine made by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac BioTech. It is one of the vaccines that will be used by the national government.The huge discrepancy between the selling prices of CoronaVac in the Philippines and in other countries prompted questions on whether the Philippines’ procurement is riddled with corruption — leading to calls for the publication of prices.
Last Sunday, Sen. Panfilo Lacson mentioned in a series of tweets that the Sinovac vaccine cost around $5, or around P240, per dose in some instances, but it costaround $38, or around P1,800, in the Philippines.
Galvez still refused to reveal the price of the vaccines, saying that it would endanger the government’s deal with Sinovac, to which it was bound by a nondisclosure agreement.
He did say that the vaccine cost was no more than P700.
Sen. Sonny Angara insisted, however, that the original vaccine price — which had skyrocketed to over P3,600 per two doses — was revealed by the Department of Health around November.
During his taped briefing on Monday, Duterte defended Galvez, assuring that the vaccine procurement was not riddled by corruption. He also justified the government’s adherence to the nondisclosure agreement, as it had been an “industry practice.”

MANILA, Philippines — Moderna, Inc. has agreed to supply the Philippines with 13 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, with the deliveries coming in mid-2021.The biotechnology company said it will work with regulators in the Philippines for necessary approvals prior to the distribution, as its vaccine is currently not yet approved for use in the country.
Moderna said a separate agreement with the Philippine government and the private sector for the supply of an additional seven million doses of the vaccine is also anticipated.“We thank the Government and the private sector for their collaboration to bring the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna to the Philippines,” Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, said in a statement Saturday.
“We appreciate the confidence in Moderna, and our mRNA platform demonstrated by the Government of the Philippines. We remain committed to making our vaccine available on every continent to help end this global pandemic,” he added.Philippine ambassador to the US Jose Romualdez earlier said the Philippine government, along with the private sector, has secured up to 20 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine.
According to the World Health Organization, the COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna has been shown to have an efficacy rate of approximately 92 percent against the disease, starting 14 days after the first dose.

ROBINSON NIÑAL JR./PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO
MANILA, Philippines — The national government has approved and ratified its plan for mass immunization against Covid-19 a year since the pandemic began in the country.
In a memorandum dated Jan. 26 but was released to the media this Saturday, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious DiseasesResolution No. 95 or the “Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for Covid-19 Vaccines” was approved.The memorandum was signed by National Task Force (NTF) against Covid-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr., as well as Defense Secretary and NTF chairperson Delfin Lorenzana, and Interior Secretary and NTF vice chairman Eduardo Año.
The memorandum ordered all agencies of NTF, its regional local Covid-19 task forces and all regional and local Covid-19 vaccination operations centers, local task forces and local Covid-19 vaccination operation centers to implement and adapt the vaccination plan.
The country’s vaccination plan, which was released by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), cited that P82.5 billion has been allocated for funding sources of the Covid-19 vaccine deployment program.
Under the 118-page vaccine plan, all regional offices and local government units are enjoined to put up vaccination operations centers (VOC) as soon as possible.
“The implementing units such as government hospitals (both private and public), private clinics, government agencies, rural health units) shall forward all concerns and reports to the City/Municipal Health Offices. The City/Municipal Health Offices, in turn, are required to report all concerns and updates to the VOC,” read the vaccine plan.
“All reports and unsettled issues of a VOC shall be raised to the overseeing VOC. The overseeing VOC, on the other hand, shall provide feedback and provide recommendation to the reporting VOC,” it added.
Masterlisting
The vaccine deployment plan also includes masterlisting or the linelisting and registration of the population before the vaccination process.
“This could be done through an online or offline platform developed by the DICT, and DOH’s KMITS and EB. From the masterlist, eligible populations for specific vaccines will be culled out and accessed by appropriate regions or LGU for registration, scheduling, mapping-out on appropriate vaccination sites and advisory,” read the Covid-19 vaccine plan.The LGUs are required to undergo profiling and screening of eligible target populations for the registration of mass immunization.
The masterlisting are as follows:
Group A includes frontline health workers, senior citizens, indigent population and uniformed personnel.
Group B includes other frontline workers and special populations.Group C, meanwhile, is the remaining population.
Consent for Covid-19 vaccine recipient
The country’s mass inoculation plan also underscored informed consent for citizens who will get vaccinated. It said informed consent is “ethical and legal requirement.”
Recipients must know the adverse effects as well as potential unknown risks of the Covid-19 vaccines.
“In the current situation, it will be important to make clear to potential recipients of a COVID-19 vaccine that the duration of immunity conferred is currently unknown and may not be equally effective across all age-groups. The benefits and risks that are disclosed will depend on what is known about them at the time consent is given,” read the vaccine deployment plan.
Post evaluation on vaccines
Also included in the vaccine plan are vaccine safety monitoring and management of adverse effects “after the first dose of vaccine was administered.”
“The role of vaccine safety monitoring during COVID-19 vaccine introduction is to facilitate the early detection, reporting, notification, investigation and analysis, and feedback of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), to ensure appropriate and timely case management and response,” read the vaccine plan.
“These activities shall assist vaccinees and ensure them of prompt and timely response should an AEFI occur,” it added.

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director-General Eric Domingo himself said earlier the Philippines might receive unregistered coronavirus vaccines donated by China as long it would be used under the supervision of the Department of Health (DOH).“Pero desisyon po nila (DOH) iyon kung tatanggapin po nila at gagamitin nila (But it’s up to them if they would accept and use it),”Domingo was quoted as saying.

The issue was brought up and discussed by senators during Tuesday’s session.
“Another suggestion, Senator(Francis)Tolentino, is the vaccine that they are authorizing to be used even without their official authority be used on them first,” Sotto, who was presiding over the session, interjected.
“Sila ang unahin yung nag-import at saka yung nagsasabi na pwede na,” the Senate leader added.
(Give it first to the importers and those allowing [the use of unregistered vaccines.)
Before this,Tolentino suggested the issuance of a Compassionate Special Permit for Covid-19 vaccines to be used for health workers.
“There’s another way for FDA to do this.Rather than issuing an emergency use authorization (EUA),they can issue a compassionate special permit, Mr.President,” he said.
“A compassionate special permit is allowed for unregistered Covid-19 vaccines and it can be distributed anywhere in the Philippines even without an EUA,” the senator added.These proposals came about afterSenatePresident Pro Tempore Ralph Recto raised concerns about the safety of health workers and other frontliners who would be inoculated with unregistered vaccines.

Recto stressed the health workers deserve the“most effective and safest vaccine” available in the market. This way, he said, more Filipinos would be encouraged to get vaccinated against Covid-19.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic
MANILA, Philippines — While other countries have begun inoculating their citizens against the coronavirus disease, the people of the Philippines are still waiting at the sidelines for the first doses of the vaccine from various drug manufacturers to arrive.
The government, through the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has so far given its emergency use authorization (EUA) to three COVID-19 vaccine developers — the United States’ Pfizer-BioNTech, United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca-Oxford University, and most recently China’s Sinovac.The EUAs were granted to speed up the process of receiving doses of vaccines even as these medicines have not been globally approved for commercial use. In the local setting, the EUAs will help push forward the country’s inoculation drive, which has been held back by a series of delays and the limited supply of vaccines.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., also the lead of the National Task Force against COVID-19, has been busy of late fending off brickbats for the delay in the arrival of the vaccines, on which hinged a number of things — jumpstarting the slumped economy, shift to the less restrictive modified general community quarantine,and the reopening of in-person school classes, to name a few.
Amid all these, the country has yet to receive a single dose of vaccine, that even President Rodrigo Duterte has been said to have expressed his impatience over the delays.
“More than 100,000 Pfizer/BioNTech doses have also been allotted to the Philippines through the COVAX initiative,” said Katharina Buchholz, a data journalist for Statista, analysis by market and data consumer company.
“But these can only be delivered after the Philippines have enacted a framework for compensating those who might potentially suffer from side effects of the vaccine. The mandatory condition that will absolve Pfizer of direct responsibility highlights the bureaucratic hurdles of receiving some coronavirus vaccines,” she added.
The Department of Health (DOH) Tuesday reported that the country has a total of 564,865 Covid-19 cases. Of the sum, 29,817 are active cases and 522,941 are recoveries. Around 12,107 individuals have succumbed to the disease.
In numbers: Vaccination drive in other Asian nations
Based on the Feb. 23 data compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, over 700 million vaccine doses have already been administered in Asia.
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations
Data showed that Israel has been vaccinating its population faster than any countries in Asia and globally. As of February 20, 82.8 doses ofA vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine while a fully vaccinated person has received the maximum required doses.
Vaccination progress in Asia
According to recent data by Statista, more than a dozen of countries in Asia had already started its vaccination drives during the past weeks.
However, the firm noted that some countries are seeing a slowdown in administering vaccines to portions of its population. This includes China, which developed its own vaccines. The consumer company saidChina’s vaccination is currently atat a rate of 2-3 doses administered per 100 people.
“[T]he campaigns are also still in the early stages,” Buchholz said.
Covid-19 have been administered in the country for every 100 people.
India, which started inoculating its people last month, also seemed to be at a slow pace when it comes to its vaccine rollout.
“[I]ndia’s rollout has been somewhat slower at currently 0.8 doses administered per 100 people despite the fact that the country has also developed its own shot and is currently producing the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine under the name Covishield. Some Indians have shunned the locally developed variety Covaxin since third stage trial results are still outstanding,” Buchholz added.
Meanwhile, the firm observed in its report that vaccine diplomacy, donation, and gifts from countries where the vaccines are developed helped several countries to to kickstart their inoculation drive.
“The Seychelles have used China’s Sinopharm vaccine since January 11 and have now already given out 66 doses per 100 people, also using Covishield from India. The Maldives, which like the Seychelles received the Covishield vaccine as a gift, counted almost 14 doses per 100 people since starting the campaign on Feb 1, according to Our World in Data.”
The donation effort of the locally produced University of Oxford vaccine is also benefiting Mauritius, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, among others. China has also donated its vaccines to Cambodia, Laos and Pakistan, while Indonesia is a paying customer to the Chinese.”
Acquired vaccines per country
Our World in Data showed that the countries in Asia have acquired and/or administered Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik V, and Covaxin.
Vaccines from US-based multinational pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech has reached the following Asian countries:
Bahrain
Cyprus
Israel
Kuwait
Lebanon
Oman
Qatar
Saudi Arabia
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Japan
Singapore
Pfizer-BioNTech uses mRNA (messenger RNA) in its vaccines. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mRNAis a genetic molecule that carries the instructions for making proteins in our body.
This vaccine requires two shots that will be given 21 days apart. It should be kept in a storge with a temperature of -70 degrees Celsius. Pfizer’s vaccine showed a 95 percent efficacy rate during its study.

Similar to Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna’s “mRNA-1273” uses mRNA in its vaccine. Moderna’s vaccine needs to be stored at -20C. Twodoses should be administered with 28 days apart.
Israel received Moderna’s vaccines which has a 94.5% efficacy rate.
China’s Sinopharm vaccine, which reportedly has a 79% efficacy rate, is used in the following Asian countries:
Bahrain
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
China
Macao
Pakistan
Cambodia
Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, developed the CoronaVac which likewise uses RNA and relies on inactivated pathogens that are grown and killed in laboratories.
This is being used in:
Turkey
China
Indonesia
CoronaVac can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius.
China’s Sinovac Biotech previously received backlash for reportedly having only a 50.4 percent efficacy rate at preventing symptomatic infections in its late-stage trial in Brazil.
Meanwhile, British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca uses a genetically altered virus called adenovirus.
This virus, which is not harmful to recipients, will carry spike protein (like the “crowns” in coronavirus). Injecting this, in theory, will help the immune system to recognize and attack coronavirus.
Among the Asian countries that are using this vaccine are:
Azerbaijan
Oman
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bangladesh
India
Maldives
Nepal
Pakistan
Sri Lanka
Myanmar
AstraZeneca’s vaccine requires a regular fridge temperature for storage.
The researchers noted that the efficacy rate for two doses – with the first dose at half strength – reached 90 percent. While a combination of two full-strength doses only resulted in 62 percent efficacy.
Gamaleya Research Institutes’s Sputnik V vaccine, a two-part adenovirus-based vector vaccine, uses a vector (an engineered virus that lacks the gene to reproduce) to send a message in cells to produce spike proteins.
“The gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed while a gene with the code of a protein from another virus spike is inserted,” the institute explained.
“This inserted element is safe for the body but still helps the immune system to react and produce antibodies, which protect us from the infection,” it added.
Sputnik V, which was found to have a 91.4% efficacy rate, is administered in:
Azerbaijan
Iran
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Pakistan
Aside from AstraZeneca, India also uses India-based firm Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in the country’s inoculation drive.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1397573/duterte-growing-impatient-over-delayed-arrival-of-vaccines-palace,Duterte growing impatient over delayed delivery of Covid vaccine — Palace,Krissy Aguilar,2021-02-19 08:01:00,"MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte himself is already growing impatient over the delay in arrival of Covid-19 vaccines, Malacañang said Friday.“Si Presidente, nagsalita na. Siya po mismo naiinip na,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in an interview over state-run People’s Television Network.
(The President has spoken. He himself is getting impatient.)
“Kinakailangan dumating na ang mga bakuna kaya naman siguro dahil nagsalita na ng ganyan ang Presidente, e gagalaw na nang mas mabilis ang lahat,” Roque added.

(The vaccines should arrive by now and since the President has already spoken, perhaps everyone will not move quickly.)
Doses of American drugmaker Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility were initially expected to arrive in the country mid-February but encountered delays due to hitches in ironing out the indemnity agreement.

The Philippines already submitted its own indemnity agreement with the COVAX facility, assuring vaccine manufacturers that the government will assume responsibility should vaccine recipients experience adverse effects.
The government, however, is still awaiting the vaccine manufacturer’s separate indemnity agreement to finalize the delivery of vaccines.
Meanwhile, the delivery of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine donated by China may also be delayed as it has yet to secure an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration.
So far, the local regulators have granted an EUA to vaccines developed by Pfizer and British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392600/duque-fda-coordinating-with-boc-to-prevent-entry-of-fake-covid-19-vaccines,Duque: FDA coordinating with BOC to prevent entry of fake Covid-19 vaccines,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,2021-02-05 22:07:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is coordinating with other government agencies like the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to prevent the entry of fake Covid-19 vaccines.
This comes amid reports of a crackdown on vials of counterfeit coronavirus jabs from China.“Meron nang pakikipag-ugnayan ang FDA, ang ating Bureau of Customs na talagang susuriing maiigi itong mga dokumento ng mga bakunang darating, at magkakaroon pa po sila ng orientation patungkol dito,” said Secretary Francisco Duque III when asked if the Department of Health has already put in place measures to bar the entry and proliferation of bogus Covid-19 vaccines in the country.
(There’s already coordination between our FDA and our Bureau of Customs to really scrutinize the documents of arriving vaccines and for them to have orientation regarding this matter.)
“At ako naman ay nakakasiguro na itong mga pekeng bakuna na ito — ay harinawa ay ‘di makapasok at kung saka-sakali naman makapasok — ‘don pa lang sa border controls natin ay talagang mapigilan na at maimbestigahan at makasuhan ang mga salarin, so ‘yan po ang pinaghahandaan,” he added.
(As for me, I’m assured that these fake vaccines — hopefully, won’t be able to infiltrate and if ever it does — we can intercept immediately at our border controls and investigate and prosecute perpetrators. That’s what’s being prepared for.)
On Tuesday, China’s state news agency Xinhua said more than 80 people were arrested in different police operations conducted in Beijing, Shanghai, and the eastern province of Shandong where 3,000 doses of false vaccines were seized.
Further reports have shown that the sinister scheme has been going on since September 2020.According to the news report, the fake vaccines only contained saline — a solution of water and salt.
The suspects appeared to have been sending the sham vaccines overseas.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1397180/why-is-ph-lagging-behind-in-covid-19-vaccination-senators-ask,Why is PH lagging behind in Covid-19 vaccination? Senators ask,Christia Marie Ramos,2021-02-18 09:26:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Some senators on Thursday have questioned why the Philippines seems to be lagging behind its vaccination program, saying that the delivery date of vaccines to the country remains unclear amid the absence of any signed supply agreement.
“Nakakailang araw na tayong kaka-practice pero wala pa rin yung bakuna and they can’t give us a definite date when it is coming,” Senator Nancy Binay said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel.(We’ve already had days of practice but until now we don’t have the vaccines yet and they can’t give us a definite date when it is coming.)
“The mere fact na we only have term sheets at the moment, wala pa tayong supply agreement na pinipirmahan, the delivery of the vaccine will always be a question. At this point ang sigurado lang ay hindi sigurado kung kailan dadating yung bakuna,” she said.
(The mere fact that we only have term sheets at the moment and we have yet to sign any supply agreement,the delivery of the vaccines will always be a question. At this point the only thing that is sure is that it is still unsure when the vaccines will arrive.)
The government targets to roll out its Covid-19 mass immunization program within the first quarter of the year, eyeing to vaccinate at least 70 million Filipinos to achieve herd immunity and significantly arrest the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the potentially fatal respiratory illness.
“I think from day one when we had this problem, lagi tayong reactionary. Kumbaga at this point, hindi tayo makahabol do’n sa pag-solve natin sa problem natin sa Covid-19,” Binay also said.
(I think from day one when we had this problem, we have always been reactionary. That’s why at this point, we can’t keep up in solving our problem with Covid-19.)
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon also lamented that the Philippines is being “left behind” in the procurement and administration of Covid-19 vaccines.
“It is very disappointing. I am worried for the future of our country,” he said in a statement.
“Each day we fail to start the vaccination raises the risk of further spread of the virus and makes our economic recovery longer,” he added.Drilon pointed out that the Philippines is lagging behind its regional peers in the vaccination of its population.
“Many are baffled by our situation. Out of the 10 countries in Southeast Asia, six have already started inoculating their citizens,” the minority leader said.
Among the countries that have started rolling out jabs are Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, leaving the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, and Thailand behind, according to Drilon.
“Bakit tayo hanggang ngayon wala pa rin?” he asked.
(Why is it that until now, we don’t have the vaccines yet.)
The Philippines has already “locked-in” 108 million doses of vaccines through “term sheets” with different manufacturers.
The government, meanwhile, will likely sign “a few” supply agreements by the end of February.
“I cannot emphasize this enough: our survival as a nation largely depends on our ability to ensure immediate access and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines to our people. At the rate things are going, however, Filipinos have to wait longer,” Drilon went on.
Aside from the lack of confidence by Filipinos in Covid-19 vaccines, the senator said politics also poses a challenge to the government’s mass vaccination program against coronavirus.
“We must prevent the politicization of the Covid-19 vaccination. The Covid-19 vaccination program will not succeed if we inject politics,” Drilon said.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1358978/duterte-clarifies-ph-not-reserving-covid-19-vaccine-due-to-shortage-not-funds-issue,PH still can’t make reservations for COVID-19 vaccines – Duterte,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,2020-11-11 06:26:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines still can’t make reservations for COVID-19 vaccines— not because it lacks funds but because other countries have already made their own reservations, President Rodrigo Duterte said in a pre-recorded address aired late on Tuesday.
According to Duterte, the United States and some countries in Europe, where the pharmaceutical companies are based, have already made a down payment on the vaccines to reserve them for their own citizens.So funding is not a problem, he said, with Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez assuring him that the government would be able to secure another loan for $300 million.
“As long as someone would lend us money, no problem about it,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino. “How long? In due time. It’s not that we don’t want to buy. There’s still nothing for us to buy.”
“So you can expect that in the few months until next year, all of those vaccines produced will be used by the Americans. Same story with the European countries who have successfully developed a vaccine,” he added.
And it’s the same situation with China, which Duterte said last April would prioritize the Philippines in the provision of vaccines.
“Again, we have to keep in mind that they have a population to worry [about], and that population is not easy,” the President said.
China would take care of its own citizens first before they give vaccines to others, he added.
Meanwhile, Duterte remained optimistic that the government could afford to shoulder the inoculation of the country’s poorest.
Filipinos with more money, he pointed out, would be able to “buy the medicines for themselves.”

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1382037/pasig-city-orders-400000-doses-of-covid-19-vaccines-from-astrazeneca,"Pasig City orders 400,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca",Cathrine Gonzales,2021-01-11 11:08:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Pasig City government has ordered 400,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca worth P100 million.
Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto announced this in a Facebook post on Sunday, as he noted that some local government units have also signed a tripartite agreement with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm and the national government.“Pasig has ordered 400K doses (100M pesos). Actual quantity and date of delivery will depend on several factors,” he said.
“We’ll buy from others as well as opportunities arise. This is to augment what the DOH will give us,” the mayor added.
Sotto earlier said the city government has allotted P300 million for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, but added that this amount may still increase.
The phase 1 of the vaccination program will benefit medical frontliners, while the phase 2 will be for senior citizens and persons with disabilities, according to a separate Facebook post from the Pasig City Public Information Office (PIO) on Monday.
“Habang isinasagawa ang Phases 1 at 2, bababa na rin ang team natin sa barangay para mag-validate ng iba pang magiging benepisyaryo. 100% FREE. Libre po nating ibabahagi ang bakuna,” the PIO added.
(While Phases 1 and 2 are being conducted, our team will go down to barangays to validate information on other beneficiaries. This will be given 100-percent free. The vaccines will be provided for free.)
As of January 8, Pasig City has already recorded a total of 9,915 COVID-19 cases, consisting of 185 active cases, 9,336 recoveries, and 394 deaths.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1390353/ph-to-get-5-6-million-doses-of-pfizer-astrazeneca-vaccine-in-q1,"PH to get 5.6 million doses of Pfizer, AstraZeneca vaccine in Q1",Daphne Galvez,2021-01-31 16:48:00,"MANILA, Philippines — At least 5.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca are expected to arrive in the country within the first quarter of this year, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Sunday.
Galvez said the Philippines stands to get a total of 9,407,400 doses from the two pharmaceutical firms within the first and second quarters of this year through the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility.The country will receive 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which will be delivered in mid-February, while 5,500,800 to 9,290,400 doses are expected from AstraZeneca, whose initial delivery is scheduled by mid to late February, according to the letter of COVAX facility to the Philippine government.
“I would like to emphasize that according to COVAX the number of doses and the projected arrival of the vaccines are all indicative since it all depends on the global supply,” Galvez said in a statement.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the Covid-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca emergency use authorization.
Galvez said many local government units (LGUs) and the private sector are ready for the vaccine roll-out: from their vaccination sites, to their cold storage equipment and facilities, to their personnel.
“We were all clueless then on how to effectively manage and mitigate the impact of this infectious disease. But with the arrival of vaccines and the implementation of the National Action Plan Against COVID-19, we are now in a better position to put an end to the epidemic,” he said.
Galvez earlier said the government aims to inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos using the 148 million doses of vaccines it expects to obtain from seven pharmaceutical firms.
He urged Filipinos to “set their fears aside” and get vaccinated against Covid-19, assuring that the vaccines the government will administer passed the stringent selection and evaluation process of the vaccine experts panel, FDA, and the Department of Health.
“We are confident that with the whole nation working together, we will be able to recover our economy and bring back a greater sense of normalcy among our people,” he said.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1383601/break-chinas-sinovac-applies-for-eua-in-ph-for-its-covid-19-vaccine,BREAK: China’s Sinovac applies for EUA in PH for its COVID-19 vaccine,Cathrine Gonzales,2021-01-14 12:23:00,"A medical worker takes a box of Sinovac’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) from a refrigerator at a community health center in Qingdao, Shandong province, China January 5, 2021. Picture taken January 5, 2021. China Daily via REUTERS
MANILA, Philippines — China’s Sinovac has applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines for its COVID-19 vaccine.
“Yesterday afternoon, nag submit ng application ang Sinovac. Ang EUA nito is from China and they are undergoing pre-assessment now,” FDA Director-General Eric Domingo said in an online press briefing on Thursday.(Sinovac submitted its application yesterday afternoon. The EUA it currently has is from China and its application for a EUA in the Philippines is undergoing pre-assessment.)
However, he said the pharmaceutical firm still has to submit more data on its clinical trials.
“Medyo kulang pa ‘yung clinical trial data na pinadala nila. Nakita ko ang pinadala pa lang nila ‘yung clinical trial phase 1 and phase 2. We will have to ask them for the clinical trial phase 3 report,” said Domingo.
(The clinical trial data they have sent still lack some details. I saw that they only submitted data on their clinical trial phases 1 and 2. We will have to ask them for their report for clinical trial phase 3.)
Sinovac is the fourth vaccine manufacturer to submit its application for a EUA in the Philippines for COVID-19 vaccines.
American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer was the first to apply for a EUA on December 23 last year. The company acquired an emergency use authorization from the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday.
British-Swede pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca also applied for a EUA on January 6, and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute applied for the authorization for its Sputnik V vaccine on January 7.
The Philippines has already secured 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac, 50,000 of which will arrive in the country by February.
However, some critics have been questioning the government’s supposed preference for vaccines from Sinovac, considering its higher price and lesser reported efficacy rate as compared to other vaccines.
Reports state that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech showed a general efficacy of less than 60 percent in its late-stage trial in Brazil. The Department of Science and Technology maintains that the efficacy of the vaccines from the Chinese firm is acceptable as it is within the minimum requirement of the World Health Organization.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1396217/duterte-urged-to-certify-indemnity-fund-bill-for-covid-19-vaccines-as-urgent,Duterte urged to certify indemnity fund bill for COVID-19 vaccines as urgent,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,2021-02-16 02:58:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Cabinet members have asked President Rodrigo Duterte to certify as urgent a bill seeking to establish an indemnity fund for those getting COVID-19 vaccines, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said on Monday.In the president’s pre-recorded briefing that aired late at night, Galvez, who heads the government‘s vaccination program, said the speed of the procurement was now in the hands of the Senate — particularly Senate President Vicente Sotto III and Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, chair of the Committee on Health and Demography.
“That’s why we have a communication, Mr. President, that these bills should be certified as urgent. That’s our recommendation,” Galvez said in Filipino.
Duterte responded by asking for the documents.
Go, who was present during Duterte’s briefing, also said that the bill had already reached the committee level.
“Secretary Galvez and I have talked so that you can certify it as urgent this week,” Go told Duterte.
The bills will create clauses in agreements between the government and pharmaceutical companies that will indemnify vaccine recipients in case they experience adverse effects.
Galvez said he had requested Sotto and Go to prioritize the indemnification clause, along with the approval of local government units of advance market commitment on the vaccines.
Last Jan. 26, Sen. Nancy Binay filed Senate Bill No. 2015 seeking to put up the indemnification fund that will be subsidized by pharmaceutical companies supplying the government with vaccines.
In turn, the government would craft a set of guidelines and an agreement, which would be required before it formally accepts the vaccines.Although the bill has not been approved, Galvez said immunization could start sometime late in February or in March — when the first batch of one to three million doses of vaccines are expected to arrive.
According to Galvez, the documentation has been accomplished, and all that was needed was for an indemnification agreement to be signed with the pharmaceutical companies.
He also assured that minor snags in the storage and rollout of the vaccines had been addressed, like having additional third-party storage facilities provided by local pharmaceutical companies, which can address the low-temperature requirement of the vaccines.
The expenses for the third-party storage facilities would also be included in the loans that the government would acquire for the COVID-19 vaccine procurement.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1379245/covid-19-vaccine-procurement-projects-of-metro-manila-lgus,LIST: COVID-19 vaccine procurement projects of Metro Manila LGUs,Cristina Eloisa Baclig,2021-01-04 16:32:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Amid the looming possibility of an uptick in cases of COVID-19 following the holidays, as well as the threat of the new variant, the local government units in Metro Manila have ramped up their plans and preparations for their vaccine procurement and inoculation.
Here are some COVID-19 vaccine-related updates from different LGUs in the National Capital Region (NCR):City of Manila
Last year, the city government of Manila launched an online portal where Manileños can sign up and pre-register for the planned free COVID-19 vaccine. Around P250 million will be used from the city’s 2021 budget to fund the free inoculation program for the residents of Manila.
According to Manila City Mayor Francisco “Isko Moreno” Domagoso, the local government had signed a nondisclosure agreement with COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
Both vaccine brands have yet to receive approval or an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Makati City
Makati Mayor Abby Binay on Monday said that their city government allocated P1 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement. She also announced that the vaccines will be soon given for free to all citizens of Makati.
Similar to what Domagaso did in Manila, Binay also tasked her office to put up an online registration system for all Makatizens who want to avail of the free vaccine.
Pasig City
In a radio interview, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto stated that around P300 million from the city’s 2021 budget has been allotted for the procurement and purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.
According to the mayor, they will purchase will COVID-19 vaccine in addition to those that will be provided by the Department of Health to local government units
“Kung ilan po ang available sa market, kung ilan ang kaya ng budget natin, gagawin po natin. I assure everyone that we will be very transparent with our procurement process once may presyo na, kung ilan, anong brand,” Sotto said.
(We will procure whatever amount we can get from the market based on our budget. I assure everyone that we will be very transparent with our procurement process — the price, amount of vaccines to be purchased, and the vaccine brand.)Quezon City
In December last year,the Quezon City government formed the “Task Force ‘Vax to Normal: The Quezon City COVID-19 Vaccine Plan” to manage the acquisition and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine to its constituents.
According to Joseph Juico, co-chair of the city’s COVID-19 Task Force, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte is eyeing a P1 billion fund for vaccine procurement.
“We would like them to know that Quezon City government would be setting aside a budget for procurement to help the national government because I know it’s a daunting task,” Juico said in a television interview over ABS-CBN News.
“When I had a conversation with the mayor, she was thinking of around one billion pesos, but that will be spread out to also procure other items that will help supplement our vaccine initiatives such as the procurement of syringes, gloves, PPEs (Personal Protective Equipment), putting up of vaccine stations and so on,” he added.
The city council on December 5 approved the resolution which authorizes Belmonte to enter into a tripartite agreement with the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and AzraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines for the advance purchase of the vaccine.
According to the city government, among those who will be prioritized for the inoculation are 10,000 health workers, 300,000 senior citizens, 20,000 adult persons with disabilities, and other priority sectors recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO).
San Juan City
San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora has likewise announced that residents in their locality can now register online for free COVID-19 vaccine jabs. He added that residents can also pre-register in their respective barangay halls or health centers.

MANILA, Philippines — Wealthy nations have already bought up at least 80% of the future COVID-19 vaccines supply, the Philippines’ vaccine czar said Wednesday.
COVID-19 policy chief implementer Carlito Galvez, Jr., who is also the designated vaccine czar, said developing countries like the Philippines are now scrambling for the remaining supply of the vaccines.“80% of the global market has been taken by the rich countries. Now we are fighting for the 18% because COVAX has gotten the other (2) percent,” Galvez said during the online Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum.
He was referring to the COVAX Facility, a global mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide which the Philippines joined in July.
The former military general explained that the deals were made possible by advance market commitments with pharmaceutical companies.
“If we will not do the advance market commitment, we will be at the tail end of the supply chain,” he said.
The Philippine government and private companies signed a supply agreement with British drugmaker AstraZeneca involving at least two million doses of its vaccine last week.
This is after President Rodrigo Duterte finally agreed to make advance commitments and advance payments to private vaccine developers to ensure supply for the Philippines despite expressing reservations in September due to the country’s procurement laws.
Galvez said the government is currently in negotiations with other big pharmaceutical companies for potential vaccine deals.
Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also looking into the vaccines of China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and Pfizer of the United States.

(Photo courtesy of PCOO)
MANILA, Philippines — Despite the delivery on Sunday of donated COVID-19 vaccines in the country, President Rodrigo Duterte still rejected the resumption of face-to-face classes in the country.
“Not now. I cannot make that decision. It will place the children in jeopardy,” he said in a press conference after the turnover ceremony of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.“I am not ready to lose the lives of our young people, our children. No,” he said when asked the issue.
Duterte had earlier thumbed down a new proposal to resume in-person classes while the government’s mass immunization program against Covid-19 remained pending.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III earlier pushed for the resumption of face-to-face classes in areas with few or no COVID-19 cases.
He said he would propose on Monday a resolution that would urge the executive department to resume face-to-face classes to allow the country’s educational system to catch up with its Southeast Asian neighbors.

“The evaluation is going to take about two weeks, so it was given to us right before Christmas.

Galvez reiterated that the Chinese government has also pledged to donate 400,000 more doses of COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to the 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac that were earlier donated to the Philippines.“Meron po tayong naprocure na 1 million na darating po sa (We have procured 1 million doses arriving on) March 21 and then with the generosity of the Chinese government, another 400,000 will be given to us, so 1.4 million ang darating (we have 1.4 million doses) coming this March,” he said during the vaccine rollout at the QualiMed Hospital in Sta. Rosa, Laguna.
“Naprocess na po namin, naibigay na po namin ang purchase order. And then nangako rin po ang ating World Health Organization (WHO) na meron pa pong parating na AstraZeneca na 4.5 million until May. So kung ko-computin po natin, every month meron po tayong darating na 1.5 million,” he added.
(We have already processed it, we have already given the purchase order. The WHO also promised to give 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca until May. So if we compute it, we will have 1.5 million doses arriving every month.)
FDA Director-General Eric Domingo earlier said that CoronaVac’s efficacy rate on healthcare workers stands at 50.4 percent based on clinical trials conducted in Brazil, making it not the best vaccine to be given to medical frontliners exposed to COVID-19 patients.
He added that the Sinovac vaccine, despite getting an emergency use authorization from the local FDA, should only be administered to clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old, citing a higher efficacy rate of 65.3 percent among clinically healthy people within this age group based on clinical trials in Indonesia, and 91.2 percent based on clinical trials in Turkey.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1384867/sinovac-jabs-varying-prices-raise-alarm,Varying prices of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine raise alarm,DJ Yap,2021-01-18 05:02:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Sharp differences in the pri­ces of the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines and neighboring countries smack of corruption, Sen. Panfilo Lacson said on Sunday.
CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, costs as little as $5 per dose, or about P240, in other Southeast Asian countries, but may be priced at $38, or more than P1,800, in the Philippines, Lacson said.“The difference in prices of Sinovac vaccine at $5, $14 and $38 reminds me of an old story about how corruption is committed in three Southeast Asian countries—UNDER the table, ON the table, and INCLUDING the table,” he said in a post on Twitter.
“Here, it may cost $38.50 (P1,847.25) per dose but is co­vered by a confidentiality disclosure agreement,” he added.
Lacson cited a report in the Bangkok Post on Saturday saying the price of CoronaVac in Thailand was $5 per dose, based on figures from the World Health Organization and from the manufacturer. But a report in India Today on Tuesday said the price of CoronaVac in India was $14, or about P673, per dose.
Vice President Leni Robredo, speaking in her radio show on Sunday, also pointed out the varying prices of CoronaVac, citing a statement of Dr. Tony Leachon, a former adviser to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, that the price of the China-made vaccine, as reported by a Thai newspaper, was $5 in Thailand and $17 (P817) in Indonesia.
Robredo asked the Department of Health (DOH) for an explanation.
During budget deliberations in November, the DOH told the Senate committee on finance that the price of the Sinovac vaccine was P3,629.50 for the two-dose regimen.
The head of the government’s vaccine program, Carlito Galvez Jr., later disputed reports about CoronaVac’s pricing, claiming it was actually lower than the prices of other brands and was in the middle among seven drug manufacturers being eyed by the Philippine government as sources of COVID-19 vaccines.
Galvez, however, refused to disclose how much Sinovac had offered the government, citing confidentiality agreements.

In a radio interview on Sunday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that while officials were still not allowed to disclose how much the Sinovac vaccine would cost the government, he could say that it would be around P650—closer to the price in Indonesia.Roque called reports that the Sinovac shot cost over P3,600 “fake news.”
“China’s prices are not like capitalist companies that are market-dictated. They can adjust their prices accordingly, depending on who is buying,” he said. “That’s why Beijing doesn’t want to announce its prices, because other countries that are not as close to them would find out they might have bought at a more expensive price.”
In a subsequent tweet on Sunday afternoon, Lacson took note of the Malacañang statement, saying: “If it’s true that [the] government is now dropping the price of [the] Sinovac vaccine from P1,847.25 per dose to only P650, the Senate has probably done our share to save our people billions of pesos in the country’s vaccination program.”
Netizens, too, “can pat themselves on the back” for their outcry, he added.
A senior lawmaker, who asked not to be identified for lack of authority to discuss confidential negotiations, told the Inquirer that the cost of the vaccine could be lowered for governments on two conditions: if the country agrees to clinical trials, and if the country has the capacity to manufacture the vaccine locally.
Preference for Sinovac
During the Senate committee of the whole’s inquiry on the vaccination program last week, Lacson also noted that implementers of the vaccine program “apparently showed preference” for the CoronaVac maker, “which may fuel speculations that corruption is involved in the government’s dealings with Sinovac.”
“Sinovac has a track record of bribery, yet why insist on dealing with them?” he said in a radio interview on Saturday.
“Considering all these, can we blame the lawmakers and even our countrymen why they express suspicion in the government’s vaccination program?” he added.
Last week, Sinovac applied with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in the Philippines, but the regulator said the company submitted incomplete papers. Lacking were the results of Phase 3 clinical trials, the FDA said.
On Saturday, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced during a meeting with President Duterte in Malacañang that China would donate 500,000 doses of CoronaVac, but Sen. Francis Pangilinan said on Sunday that the donation should not influence the FDA into hastily approving the Sinovac vaccine.
“Science and the data and results of clinical trials should be the sole basis and not political goodwill,” Pangilinan said in a post on Twitter.
Critics have slammed the government’s plan to buy 25 million doses of CoronaVac, pointing out its steep price and poor showing in clinical trials.
The latest disappointing report about CoronaVac came from Brazil last week, with researchers returning a finding that the vaccine was only 50.4 percent effective, barely enough to gain regulatory approval.
Not done deal
At the close of the Senate inquiry on Friday, Galvez said the government had not yet paid for the 25 million doses and had only secured an advance market commitment from Sinovac to “lock in” a certain number of doses for the Philippines.
“So it’s not a done deal?” Sen. Nancy Binay asked.
“No,” Galvez replied. —WITH A REPORT FROM KRIXIA SUBINGSUBING INQ

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1392046/manila-aims-to-finish-measles-vaccination-before-arrival-of-covid-19-vaccines,Manila targets completion of measles jabs before arrival of Covid-19 vaccines,Cathrine Gonzales,2021-02-04 14:54:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Manila Health Department (MHD) is eyeing to finish its vaccination drive against measles and rubella (German measles) before the arrival of the Covid-19 vaccines in the country.
Manila City health officer Dr. Arnold Pangan said Thursday that the local measles vaccination drive should be completed before the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines, so that health personnel of the local government unit can fully focus on vaccination activities against the new coronavirus.So far, 38,603 children aged nine to 59 months (four years and nine months) in the city have already been vaccinated against measles and rubella since the inoculation program started last Monday.
The figure represents 27.10 percent of the MHD’s target, according to Pangan.
He said the city government aims to vaccinate about 146,000 children by mid-February.
“If we can do it in two weeks time, mas maganda po kasi baka dumating na ’yung COVID-19 vaccine. Baka magdodoble-doble pa po ‘yung trabaho nila (health workers), so pinipilit natin na bilisan pa para po mas ma-achive natin ‘yung goal natin the soonest possible time,” Dr. Pangan said in a statement.
(If we can do it in two weeks time, that would be better because Covid-19 vaccines may already arrive, and then the work of our health workers may become doubly hard. That’s why we want to expedite the vaccination so that we can achieve our goal at the soonest possible time.)
The vaccination program against measles is being implemented nationwide through coordination between the Department of Health, World Health Organization, United Nations Children’s Fund, RELIEF International, Healthy Philippines, and local government units across the country.

https://business.inquirer.net/311174/covid-19-vaccine-seen-giving-ph-economy-a-boost,COVID-19 vaccine seen giving PH economy a boost,Ben O. de Vera,2020-11-06 05:18:00,"As Asia transitions to a “Goldilocks” phase of economic recovery in 2021, the Philippines is seen by global financial services giant Morgan Stanley among the countries that will benefit the most from the availability of COVID-19 vaccines.
Across the region, “this Goldilocks phase should see accelerating and above-trend year-on-year growth, rising but still benign inflation, and ‘big easy’ policies,” Morgan Stanley Research said in a Nov. 3 report titled “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.”“In particular, we believe that India, Indonesia and the Philippines look better placed in this Goldilocks environment, as they stand to benefit more from early vaccine availability and the Fed’s AIT framework,” Morgan Stanley added, referring to the US Federal Reserve’s new average inflation targeting which started this year.
“Even though daily COVID-19 cases have also come off earlier highs in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, these economies are likely trailing their Asian counterparts when it comes to COVID-19 containment. We think they could benefit disproportionately from vaccine availability, which could come as soon as later this year and/or early next year,” Morgan Stanley said.
In the case of the Philippines, Morgan Stanley noted that the government had already been in discussions with a number of possible vaccine sources such as China, Russia and the World Health Organization, as well as giant US drug firms like Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc.
“The government is also planning to hold talks with Australian biotech firm CSL Ltd. and partner University of Queensland, as it looks to diversify possible vaccine sources. While policymakers acknowledged that the Philippines does not have its own vaccine manufacturing capacity, it has sought to join clinical trials for vaccines,” Morgan Stanley said.
Also, the Philippines, India and Indonesia enjoy relatively lower debt-to-gross domestic product ratios compared to their neighbors, making them better positioned for an economic rebound in the medium term.
“We still believe that those with better balance sheets, better demographic trends and institutional ability to push through structural reforms to offset headwinds from deglobalization are likely to fare better. All things considered, we think India, Indonesia and the Philippines look better placed,” Morgan Stanley said.

“Nag-order ako, kung pwede, sa malalaking kumpanya. Katulad nitong AstraZeneca, 2 million. Moderna, 200,000,” PRC chairman Senator Richard Gordon said in an interview over Teleradyo.(I ordered from big companies. Like AstraZeneca, 2 million. Moderna, 200,000.)
“At may kakausapin pa kaming ibang tao,” he added.
(We will also be talking to other people.)
Earlier, the senator said that the PRC is also eyeing to secure vaccine doses from Pfizer.
In its vaccination drive, Gordon said the PRC would allow vaccinees to donate for the vaccination of those who cannot afford the anti-Covid shots.
“Yung can afford, magbabakuna siya. Yung mahirap bibigyan niya ng pambakuna,” he added.
(Those who can afford, if they will get vaccinated, they can donate for the poor.)
Only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have so far secured an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Three companies are still waiting for their EUA approval from the FDA namely Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, China’s Sinovac, and India’s Bharat Biotech.
The Philippine government has already secured 108 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines after it signed five term sheets with different vaccine manufacturers, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1367206/ph-not-late-in-buying-covid-19-vaccines-galvez,PH not late in buying COVID-19 vaccines — Galvez,Darryl John Esguerra,2020-12-02 13:41:00,"MANILA, Philippines — COVID-19 policy chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. believes that the Philippines is not yet late in securing coronavirus vaccines supply although he admitted there are hindrances in the country’s procurement of the much-needed vaccines.
“I believe we are not late yet because we have ongoing negotiations with different leading (pharmaceutical) companies,” Galvez said during the weekly Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum on Wednesday.The former military explained that President Rodrigo Duterte’s clearance was needed to ensure that the government could make necessary advance payments and commitments on vaccine deals which is strictly prohibited by the country’s auditing laws.
Duterte has agreed to make advance market commitments and advance payments to private COVID-19 developers to ensure supply for the Philippines despite expressing reservations in September.
The Philippine government and private companies signed a supply agreement with British drugmaker AstraZeneca involving at least two million doses of its vaccine last week.
But Galvez expressed confidence that the country can achieve at least 50 million doses of vaccines by 2021.
The Philippines aims to vaccinate up to 60 percent of the population against COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity.
Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also looking into the vaccines of China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and Pfizer of the United States.

(Screengrab from Senate Youtube livestream)
MANILA, Philippines — The Senate Committee of the Whole on Monday opened its inquiry on the government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan.
Senators will be asking officials about the details of the government’s plan with the P72.5-billion funding allocated for the COVID-19 vaccines under the 2021 national budget.RELATED STORY: Explainer: Facts about 7 COVID-19 vaccines Philippines may get
RELATED STORY: TIMELINE: The scuttled COVID-19 vaccine deal with Pfizer
The Senate’s hearing comes in light of several controversies surrounding the government’s inoculation plan.
In December, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III was accused of “dropping the ball” in the country’s deal with US drug maker Pfizer, which would have secured the delivery of 10 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines this month.
Meanwhile, the PresidentialSecurity Group (PSG)found itself in hot water after it was revealed that some members received a COVID-19 jab despite regulators not yet authorizing the use of a vaccine in the country.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III, who will be leading the inquiry as chair of the Committee of the Whole, earlier said he would not stop his fellow senators from raising the controversial vaccination of PSG personnel during the hearing.

Sotto, however, said no official connected to the said issue was invited to Monday’s hearing “because it’s not [on] the agenda.”
Cabinet officials who have confirmed attendance in the hearing are vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Rolando Domingo, according to a document provided by Sotto’s office over the weekend.
Other officials who confirmed their attendance were Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Interior Secretary Eduardo Año and Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato dela Peña.
Galvez previously said the government hopes to vaccinate 60 to 70 percent of Filipinos against the coronavirus — enough to trigger herd immunity—within three to five years.
The government is banking on the Sinovac vaccine from China to be the first to reach the Philippines with officials saying it may arrive in the first quarter of 2021.The government is looking to secure up to 25 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine.
The country has so far formally secured 2.6 million doses of vaccine from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which are expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021.
The Philippines has so far logged485,797 COVID-19 cases.Over 449,000 have recovered while 9,398 have died.

(We are happy to announce that the COVAX facility already approved the deployment of vaccines in the Philippines. We may get 30 to 40 million doses of vaccines for free.)
Galvez did not make mention of a specific vaccine that the country will receive from the COVAX facility, a platform that aims to ensure rapid, fair, and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines for people in all countries.
But earlier, he said the Philippines might be able to get the Covid-vaccine developed by American drugmaker Pfizer-BioNTech as early as February via COVAX facility.
Asked which vaccines the Philippines could receive from the COVAX facility, Galvez said it may be Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, COVAVAX developed by the Serum Institute of India, and Johnson & Johnsons.
“Talagang ito po ay global interest na we can contain yung virus through the WHO [World Health Organization] concept of equitable access to poor countries like us,” Galvez said.

The local council has approved the resolution that authorizes Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte to enter into a tripartite agreement with the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and AzraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines for the advance purchase of the vaccine.The city council cited provisions of the Local Government Code, which grants the city the power to promote the health and safety of its citizens as well as to protect them from the harmful effects of potentially deadly respiratory ailment caused by SARS-CoV-2.
“With the council resolution, we will soon finalize the tripartite partnership and begin the process of prioritizing our most vulnerable citizens,” Belmonte said in a statement on Tuesday.
The local government said it will prioritize its 10,000 health workers, 300,000 senior citizens, 20,000 adult persons with disabilities, and other priority sectors as recommended by the World Health Organization.
The city has allocated an initial P1 billion in its 2021 budget to purchase vaccines and supplies needed for the inoculation.
Apart from AstraZeneca, the Quezon City government is also eyeing to obtain vaccines from other pharmaceutical companies that have developed a serum against the novel coronavirus.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1364963/ph-vaccination-goal-70-of-pinoys-in-5-yrs,PH COVID-19 vaccination goal: 70% of Pinoys in 5 years,Jerome Aning,2020-11-26 05:32:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The government hopes to vaccinate for the new coronavirus 60 to 70 percent of all Filipinos — enough to trigger herd immunity — within three to five years, the chief of the COVID-19 task force said on Wednesday.
Speaking at a news briefing, Undersecretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government could only vaccinate 20 million to 30 million people a year, and he estimated that P73 billion would be initially spent for the effort, not only to buy the required two doses for each citizen but also to cover “ancillary costs,” such as syringes and mobilization.Galvez, chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19, said the sources of the P73 billion—loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank—might be “unlocked” by December.
“So rest assured that the funds to be used will be prepared this coming December,” he said, adding that as the task force was considering various options in placing advance orders for vaccines, it was actually preparing to spend P70 billion to P150 billion.
Priority recipients
He said the Department of Health (DOH) had given the task force a list of 35 million Filipinos who would be the priority recipients of the chosen vaccine.
Those people, he said, include health-care workers, police and military personnel and other servicemen, essential workers from the social welfare and education departments and other government agencies, the elderly and the poor.
The task force plans to make the distribution of vaccines geographical, Galvez said, adding that the worst-hit areas—Metro Manila, Calabarzon and Central Luzon, and the cities of Cebu, Davao and Cagayan de Oro—will get priority so that “we can immediately feel the [vaccines’] effect, and if this happens life will return to normal in these centers of the economy.”
Galvez said the mass vaccinations could start in the second quarter or middle of 2021 at the earliest, which he described as the “best-case scenario.” At the latest, which he called the “worst-case scenario” but also the “realistic scenario,” it could start at the end of 2021 or early 2022.
The government is negotiating with foreign governments and vaccine makers for vaccine supplies, Galvez said.
He said Philippine officials were talking not only with the governments of Russia, China, United States and United Kingdom but also with the governments of Australia and India for vaccine supplies.
“[For our plan to] vaccinate 60 million Filipinos, we are getting the portfolio of access to different vaccine producers [in] the countries where the vaccines will come from, and we have at least five to six where the vaccines can be sourced,” Galvez said.No storage problem
Galvez gave assurance that storing the vaccines would not be a problem, given that the task force had six months to plan the logistics.
For vaccines that need to be stored in near-zero or freezing-point temperatures, Philippine hospitals will be able to manage, he said. For vaccines that require storage in negative 20 to negative 80 degrees Celsius, the task force will negotiate with consortiums that can provide the storage units, he said.
Whatever vaccine would be chosen by the Philippines would need approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Galvez said.
The government’s vaccine expert panel will now start evaluating AstraZeneca’s application to hold clinical trials in the Philippines of its candidate vaccine, which has been found to be on average 70 percent effective against the coronavirus.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Wednesday that the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company completed documentary requirements last week, clearing the way for the start of the regulatory process for its clinical trial. She, however, did not say when AstraZeneca will start the trial.
Five pharmaceutical companies are applying to test their candidate vaccines on Filipinos.
Apart from AstraZeneca, the companies are China’s Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and the United States’ Johnson&Johnson.
Only Sinovac has reached the more advanced stage of the regulatory process as it awaits the ethics board’s approval of its clinical trial.
Locally tried vaccine
Earlier, Vergeire said the government preferred buying a vaccine developed by a company that had tried the drug in the country. She explained that because vaccines work differently across ethnicities, testing a vaccine on Filipinos gives the government the opportunity to see how the candidate vaccine may affect the population.
Initial results on the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University showed 90 percent efficacy among patients who received half a dose of the vaccine, followed by a full dose at least a month apart.
For those who received two full doses of the vaccine at least a month apart, efficacy was 62 percent, resulting in an average efficacy of 70 percent.
While the vaccine breached the World Health Organization’s benchmark efficacy of 50 percent, the UN body said more data on its safety and efficacy were needed since the initial results were based on only more than 11,000 participants from the United Kingdom and Brazil.
In a statement, AstraZeneca said it expected to enroll up to 60,000 participants in its large-scale Phase 3 trials. The planned trial in the Philippines and other Asian and European countries will complement the ones being conducted in the United States, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Kenya and Latin America.
Although the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be sold at cost and is logistically compatible with the Philippines, Vergeire said it was still too early to say that this was the most practical and ideal vaccine for the country.
“We still need to see the technical details of the vaccine. Everything has to be taken into this complete context wherein we study everything — specific and very critical is to see the performance of this vaccine, based on the evaluation of our experts,” she said.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1395231/fda-checking-on-alleged-arrival-of-modernas-covid-19-vaccine-in-ph,FDA checking on alleged arrival of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine in PH,Cathrine Gonzales,2021-02-12 20:47:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Friday it is checking on reports that Covid-19 vaccines from Moderna have allegedly arrived in the country, as it disclosed that the United States drugmaker may apply for an emergency use authorization (EUA) of its coronavirus inoculation shots next week.
FDA director-general Eric Domingo said they don’t have information yet on which port in the country the Moderna vaccines were supposedly delivered.“We have no info on it. Our enforcement unit is still checking the reports,” he said in a text message to INQUIRER.net.
Asked about the possible application of Moderna for a EUA in the country, Domingo said: “Yes, I think they will apply next week.”
To date, only Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca have so far secured EUA in the Philippines, which is being required for available Covid-19 vaccines to be legally administered in the country.
The Philippines is set to receive 20 million doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, with Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Romualdez earlier saying that the vaccines from the company may be delivered in mid-2021.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1380514/ph-seeks-148m-doses-from-7-drugmakers,PH seeks 148 million doses from 7 COVID-19 vaccine makers,Jerome Aning,2021-01-07 05:32:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines is negotiating with seven vaccine manufacturers to procure at least 148 million doses as it seeks to inoculate close to two-thirds of its population this year, according to the head of the country’s national vaccination program and chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.
Speaking at the Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday, Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government was hoping to close deals with Novavax, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson of the United States, United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac Biotech and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute.“Based on our current negotiations, we will be able to purchase at least 148 million doses from more or less seven manufacturers. However, it will be dependent on the global supply,” he said.
“The government will have a portfolio of vaccines,” he said. “This means we will get vaccines from different manufactures. This is to ensure that we we will have vaccines for everyone, particularly this year 2021.”
Full subsidy
Galvez said the Philippines also would receive fully subsidized doses for around 23 million Filipinos through the Covax Facility, which is aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide equitable access to all countries to safe and effective vaccines, once these are licensed and approved.
Covax is led jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the Geneva-based Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
Galvez said the Philippines and Colombia would be the first two countries to take part in the solidarity trial of the WHO for COVID-19 vaccine candidates set also for this month.
He said as many as 15,000 volunteers from Metro Manila would participate in the clinical trial, which would be implemented by the Department of Science and Technology and the Philippine General Hospital.
“This is so that we can have a full evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine,” he said.
The former military chief of staff did not disclose the candidate vaccines that would be used in the trial.
The Philippines had earlier targeted 80 million doses and though it has been talking with vaccine-makers for months, the country had secured only 2.6 million, from AstraZeneca, paid for by a private sector group, which will give half of the shots to their employees.Priority recipients
On Wednesday, AstraZeneca applied for an emergency use authorization for its vaccine in the Philippines.
Galvez said the priority recipients of the vaccines have already been designated—health-care workers, vulnerable indigent senior citizens, [residents of] poor communities, uniformed personnel, teachers and school workers, government workers, overseas Filipino workers and other essential workers.
A “whole-of-nation” approach will also be undertaken to involve local governments and the private sector in the vaccination program.
He said the local governments would help in identifying the priority vaccine recipients, while the private sector would provide technical and financial support for storage and deployment.
Even though the government- provided vaccines are going to be free, people will have to volunteer to be inoculated and local governments have to convince their constituents to have themselves inoculated.
Trust level
In San Juan City, Mayor Francis Zamora said the important thing was to “increase the trust level” of residents on vaccines.
“Right now, we understand that there is still some skepticism surrounding COVID-19 vaccines because these are newly developed,” he said.
At least 4,109 of an estimated 122,000 San Juan residents had signed up for vaccination as of Tuesday afternoon, just a day after the city government announced opened the registration.
Zamora was hopeful that more of his constituents would sign up for an orderly and fast roll out of vaccines, and that the city would be able to ease the vaccination process as early as April.
He said the city would prioritize the inoculation of health workers and front-liners to be vaccinated first, followed by indigent senior citizens and other residents who registered.
The city council last year passed Ordinance No. 75 allocating P50 million for vaccine procurement.
According to Zamora, the money was “more than enough” because the national government would also be giving funds to local governments for their vaccine needs.
He said he preferred a vaccine with a high efficacy rate, made by a company that had a “good reputation” and met the standards set by local and international agencies.

MANILA, Philippines — Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Wednesday said the COVID-19 vaccines administered to some members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) were smuggled since the Food and Drug Administration has not authorized its use.
He said the PSG must explain their use of unauthorized vaccines, saying that the inoculation of some of PSG members “violated FDA rules.”“Yes, it’s smuggled kasi hindi authorized na pumasok dito (Its emtry in the country is not authorized).Only the government can authorize that through the FDA,” he said in an interview at the sidelines of Rizal Day celebration in Manila.
“Kailangan ipaliwanag ng PSG because they violated FDA rules. Explain ng PSG bakit ginawa ‘yun,” Lorenzana added.
(The PSG should explain why they did it.)
He added that he doesn’t know who donated the vaccines, which were reportedly developed by Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm.
He said he only knew about the vaccination after Duterte’s close-in security were vaccinated.

Lorenzana, however,said he does not think the entry of unauthorized COVID-19 vaccines in the country is a breach of security since the intention of the PSG was good.
“Maganda layunin (The intention is good), everybody is safe from COVID-19,” he said.
Still, Lorenzana, pointed out that FDA rules must be strictly followed.
He said the agency must expedite the approval of COVID-19 vaccines so that the country could start importing.“Ang dapat gawin ng FDA, madaliin pag-approve para makapag-import na ang legitimate importers and government kasi nagva-vaccine na sa ibang lugar. FDA should fasttrack,” Lorenzana said.
(The FDA should expedite its approval of COVID-19 vaccines so that legitimate importers could start importing.)
In a separate interview on Wednesday, PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III revealed that the inoculation of some PSG members was done among themselves, without the help of a medical professional. #

It’s so easy,” Durante admitted in an interview on ANC’s “Headstart.”Asked if Durante himself inoculated the vaccine to the PSG officials, he said: “As I’ve said, we vaccinated ourselves. It is within our command.” “We’ve done our research. For now, we’ve found the appropriate vaccine for us, which I could say is a traditional vaccine, so we took the risk,” he said.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said that the country would receive at least two COVID-19 vaccines as early as February.Senator Panfilo Lacson then asked Galvez, during the hearing of the Senate Committee of the Whole, when the first COVID-19 vaccination would happen.
Galvez initially said it would be on February 20 but later clarified he was referring to the expected delivery of the vaccines.
“Ang tanong ko nga, kailan ‘yung unang bakuna? (My question is, when is the first vaccination?)” Lacson asked.
“…Para naman umasa ‘yung mga kababayan natin na sa February 28 or sa March 1 mababakunahan sila, pwede bang i-share mo lang sa amin kailan yung unang bakuna sa tantya mo?” he further asked.
(So that our countrymen can have hope that they could be vaccinated by February 28 or March 1, can you share with us when you think the first vaccination will be administered?)

https://business.inquirer.net/304688/covid-19-vaccine-uncertainty-tempers-ph-growth-goal-for-2021,COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty tempers PH growth goal for 2021,Ben O. de Vera,2020-08-07 10:38:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Without a vaccine yet to prevent COVID-19’s spread, President Duterte’s economic managers have tempered growth expectations for next year despite recovery from this year’s recession.
The Cabinet-level Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) last July 28 approved via ad referendum their projection that real gross domestic product (GDP) will contract between 4.4 percent and 6.6 percent — or an average of 5.5 percent — this year.In the first half, the economy shrank by an average of 9 percent as second-quarter GDP fell by a record 16.5 percent year-on-year and brought about a technical recession.
For 2021, GDP was projected to rebound by growing 6.5-7.5 percent, although slower than the DBCC’s estimate last May of a stronger 8-9 percent economic expansion.
Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua, the country’s chief economist, explained to the Inquirer that the slower growth range projection for next year was approved “to adjust to the emerging consensus that the virus will stay longer and the vaccine longer to develop.”
“The pandemic is assumed to last longer than we earlier thought — not until September only; could extend to the end of 2020 when vaccines are thought to become available,” Department of Finance (DOF) Undersecretary and chief economist Gil S. Beltran told the Inquirer separately.
“Recession in 2020 is deeper so that recovery would take longer,” Beltran added.
Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III during Security Bank’s online economic forum last Thursday expressed optimism that a vaccine “can bring a definitive end to this crisis.”
“Countries that are leading in the funding and development of these potential vaccines have committed to give the Philippines priority in purchasing doses once these are approved,” Dominguez said.
“The government, for its part, has adequate funds to purchase the vaccines. But for now, since we don’t have the vaccine yet, we treat infections and find ways to co-exist with the virus,” Dominguez added.
Last week, Dominguez said the government can afford to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and provide them for free to the poor through loans to be extended by two well-capitalized state-run banks.Dominguez had explained that their plan was for state-run Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC) to purchase the COVID-19 vaccines to be approved by the DOH’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), through a term loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines (Landbank) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).
“PITC will sell the vaccines to the DOH. The DOH will pay PITC over time from their future allocations from the national budget,” Dominguez had said.
Referring to Landbank and DBP, Dominguez had said that “the current balance sheets of both GFIs [government financial institutions] can support the estimated loan requirement of P20 billion.”
“Please recall that since 2016, by hardly collecting any dividends from Landbank and DBP, the national government, in effect, strengthened their capital bases. This, in turn, was made possible by the tax and administrative reforms that increased government revenues,” Dominguez had noted.
The two lenders’ cash dividends—mandated among government-owned and/or -controlled corporations (GOCCs) to be remitted to the national treasury—were being waived in recent years and instead used to recapitalize themselves.
As for those who could afford themselves a vaccine, Dominguez had said Landbank and DBP can also “fund loans to qualified borrowers who wish to supply FDA-approved vaccines on a commercial basis.”
Separately, Landbank president and chief executive Cecilia C. Borromeo told the Inquirer last week that the lender “may extend a credit facility for PITC for the purchase of necessary vaccines on behalf of the DOH, similar to what Landbank did when the national government launched the generic medicine program years ago.”
“The amount for the trade transaction credit facility will be based on the requirement of PITC, and the sharing between Landbank and DBP will logically be based on the size of the balance sheets of the GFIs and the preference of the DOF,” according to Borromeo, whose Landbank is bigger than DBP.

MANILA, Philippines — Some 2,793 individuals have already been inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine, two days after the government rolled out its vaccination program, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Wednesday.
“Meron na po tayo from 11 hospitals, meron na po tayong 2,793 na na-inoculate as of 19:33 (7:33 p.m.) kagabi,” Galvez said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel when asked how many people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 so far.(From 11 hospitals, we have 2,793 inoculated as of 19:33 last night.)
Of the total vaccine recipients, Galvez said 12 people experienced “minor” adverse effects while 154 people deferred their scheduled vaccination.
“Meron po tayong 154 na deferred kasi during screening, nakita natin na may high blood (pressure), yung mga ninenerbyos at saka yung talagang di-nefer natin because of some medical conditions,” Galvez explained.
(We have 154 people who deferred because, during the screening, they either had high blood pressure, nervousness or had some medical conditions.)
The Philippines was able to launch its Covid-19 vaccination program after receiving 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by the Chinese government.
Cebu City and Davao City are expected to roll out the vaccines this week at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center and at the Southern Philippines Medical Center, respectively.
The government is eyeing to vaccinate all healthcare workers in March, Galvez has said.

https://business.inquirer.net/316094/recovery-at-risk-due-to-slow-covid-vaccine-plan,Recovery at risk due to slow COVID vaccine plan,Ben O. de Vera,2021-01-20 04:11:00,"While multilateral lenders have committed to jack up loan financing so the Philippines can buy COVID-19 vaccines, the government’s procurement has been the slowest in the region so far such that economists worry that an economic rebound would also lag.
The latest World Bank documents showed the Washington-based lender’s upcoming additional financing for the Philippines’ COVID-19 Emergency Response Project to be implemented by the Department of Health was raised to $400 million as of Jan. 16 from $300 million previously.As such, the total commitment across 14 loans in the World Bank’s near-term lending pipeline for the Philippines rose to $2.9 billion.
Besides the World Bank loan for vaccine procurement and distribution, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank has also committed $325 million under its Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility while the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is reviewing financing requests from member-countries, including the Philippines.
Despite a flurry of available financing, Citigroup managing director and head of Asia-Pacific economic and market analysis Johanna Chua told a webinar organized by debt watcher Fitch Ratings on Tuesday that the Philippines was a laggard in the region in purchasing COVID-19 vaccines.
“When it comes to vaccine procurement and we kind of track the supply, I think the Philippines is actually the one with the least procurement. In Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Singapore seems to be a little bit ahead, and then Thailand’s a little bit more than Malaysia [which was] sort of in the middle, and the Philippines
a little bit lagging,” Chua said.In a report, London-based Capital Economics said that while “a vaccine should eventually prove a game-changer for the economy,” the Philippines has so far “only secured a small number of doses and faces many logistical challenges to achieving widespread vaccination.”
For Chua, a revert to pre-pandemic gross domestic product (GDP) levels “may take longer” in the Philippines or up to 2022 even as other Asian countries, which also suffered from huge numbers of infections like India and Indonesia, could bounce back sooner.
Chua said it did not help that the Philippines has been under prolonged quarantine such that mobility restrictions badly hit the services sector and its workers—among the bigger contributors to the domestic economy
Chua was also worried that the Philippines’ private-sector investment boom pre-pandemic might not return as fast as it could post-pandemic.
“Even though the fiscal balance sheet is very strong so the government can come in to provide some support and that could help drive the infrastructure, I worry that the lag, the overhang on private-sector capex is going to take a lot longer to unwind going into post-rebound” from the pandemic-induced recession, Chua said.According to Capital Economics, “the economic scars from the downturn, including business insolvencies, weaker household balance sheets and high unemployment, will weigh heavily on demand” this year such that consumer spending, which accounted for about 70 percent of the Philippines’ GDP, was “set to remain in the doldrums.”
“While new infections are past their peak, they remain high and social distancing is likely to remain a drag on the economy throughout 2021,” Capital Economics said.
For Capital Economics, the Philippines’ “failure to contain the virus and lackluster fiscal support means it will experience one of the slowest recoveries” in the Asia-Pacific region.
“The economy has been slow to rebound so far. We estimate the GDP is still 8-percent below its pre-crisis level and even by the end of 2022 output is still likely to be 7.5-percent below the level it would have been had the crisis not happened,” Capital Economics added. INQ

MANILA, Philippines — Health Secretary Francisco Duque III will not be inoculated with the CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’sSinovac, according to the Department of Health (DOH).“FTD (Francisco T. Duque) will not be vaccinated with SINOVAC as EUA (emergency use authorization) provisions exclude 60 and above. He also underscores that we will follow the prioritization framework, and will ensure that limited doses will go to the HCWs (healthcare workers) first,” the DOH told reporters in a Viber message on Sunday night.Duque, 64, earlier said he is willing to receive the CoronaVac, but added that the age restriction recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the vaccines from the Chinese firm may be an issue. On Sunday, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go also said that Duque and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. will be vaccinated on Monday morning with the Covid-19 vaccine from Sinovac. FDA Director-General Eric Domingo earlier said that the CoronaVac, despite getting a local EUA, should only be administered to clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old, as the vaccine showed higher efficacy rates in this age group.He said that the vaccine showed a higher efficacy rate of 65.3 percent among clinically healthy people within this age bracket based on clinical trials in Indonesia, and 91.2 percent based on clinical trials in Turkey. The donated 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine from China arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, with the doses transported to the Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center early Monday morning.

He did not disclose the volume of vaccines to be delivered to both hospitals, but assured that the distribution will be “equitable.”
“Kung meron pa pong sobra, bibigyan na rin po ang ibang regions dito sa Region 3, Region 4A, Baguio City at other areas na tinamaan ng Covid-19,” Galvez said.
(If we have an excess, we will also deliver vaccines to other regions like Region 3, Region 4A, Baguio City and other areas that are badly affected by Covid-19.)
The Philippines started its Covid-19 vaccination program on Monday using part of the Chinese government – donated 600,00 doses of CoronaVac vaccines developed by Sinovac.

Camus,2021-02-09 15:13:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Budget carrier AirAsia Philippines is seeking the government’s approval to transport Covid-19 vaccines amid global efforts to curb the spread of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
AirAsia Philippines said in a statement on Tuesday it has applied for regulatory approval as a so-called dangerous goods carrier.Moreover, it is seeking special authorization from the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) to proactively participate in the possible rollout of vaccines across the country.
“Aside from our existing route network, we are committed to mount charter flights to provincial airports which can accommodate wide-body aircrafts such as the Airbus 320 to fast-track vaccine distribution efforts,” AirAsia Philippines CEO Ricardo Isla said.
The carrier is committing to aid the government in its distribution efforts ahead of the arrival of at least 5.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the first quarter of 2021.
The Food and Drug Administration last month approved the emergency use authorization for the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca COVID19 vaccines.
AirAsia Philippines said it can also assist in the distribution via Teleport, the company’s logistics venture for door-to-door delivery.
Teleport is now widely available in 12 key cities in the country such as Bacolod, Cebu, General Santos, Iloilo, Kalibo, Puerto Princesa, Tacloban, Tagbilaran, Cagayan de Oro, and Zamboanga, the budget airline said.

MANILA, Philippines — The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines developed by US firm Moderna is expected to arrive in the Philippines by the end of May or early part of June, the country’s ambassador to the US Jose Romualdez said Friday.
In a televised briefing, Romualdez said the Philippine government, private sector and Moderna are ironing out the supply agreement to finalize the delivery.“We’ve already concluded the agreement, yung supply na lang. We’re threshing out the supply kung kailan nga nila pwede ideliver itong Moderna,” Romualdez said.
(We’ve already concluded the agreement, we’re working on the supply. We’re threshing out the supply on when these Moderna vaccines will be delivered.)
“Ito medyo katumbas ng Pfizer, and we’re hoping that we will have the first deliveries by either end of May or early part of June, yan ang tinatarget natin,” he added.
(It’s almost equivalent to Pfizer, and we’re hoping that we will have the first delivery by either end of May or early part of June, that’s our target.)

Romualdez earlier said the Philippine government, along with the private sector secured up to 20 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine. “Half of that or almost half of that will go to the private sector and their employees, malaking force yan. And then the other half will go to our health workers and the rest of Filipinos that will be receiving the Moderna through the LGUs and other entities there in the Philippines,” Romualdez said.
Meanwhile, Romualdez said 117,000 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility are also expected to arrive soon.
“The 117,000, that was promised by COVAX, I understand from [vaccine czar] Sec. [Carlito] Galvez medyo nagkaroon lang ng kaunting delay pero darating din daw. It’s supposed to be coming to the Philippines within the next couple of weeks,” Romualdez said.
The Pfizer vaccine was scheduled to arrive in mid-February but encountered delays due to issues on the indemnification agreement.

The Philippines is currently in final talks with Moderna for the procurement of up to 20 million doses of its vaccine.
“The creation and deployment of safe and effective vaccines take us a step closer to defeating this pandemic and restoring our economies,” Romualdez also said.
He then underscored the importance of close collaboration within the international community and between governments and private entities in ensuring the procurement of vaccines.
In the Philippines, the government is eyeing the rollout of the national inoculation program by February.

MANILA, Philippines — American biotechnology company Moderna is accelerating a huge shipment of COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said, citing information from Manila’s top diplomat in the United States.
Locsin made the announcement on Sunday, more than a week after Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose “Babe” Romualdez said Moderna and another company, Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc., are willing to supply up to 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines in the third quarter of 2021.“More good news from Babe: Moderna on board and accelerating huge shipment. Everything’s falling back into place,” Locsin tweeted.
“We will have complete range of vaccines from least effective to most available for everyone to choose from,” he added.
Locsin added that a COVID-19 vaccine will not be “mass deployed” unless the “official recommending it for mass deployment is seen taking it himself.”

“The only proof of the pudding is in the eating it oneself and no one else in his place until we see the side effects of the pudding if any,” Locsin said.

Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine earlier received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration.This will enable the pharmaceutical firm to apply for an EUA in the Philippines.
The Philippine government and private companies signed a supply agreement with British drugmaker AstraZeneca involving at least two million doses.
Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also looking into the vaccines of China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and Pfizer from the US.
Earlier, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III received backlash after he allegedly “dropped the ball” in the Pfizer vaccine deal, which would have secured the delivery of 10 million doses of the company’s vaccine to the Philippines as early as January next year.

“The State Councilor informed the Secretary of China’s intention to donate 500,000 doses of vaccines to the Philippines, in keeping with President Xi’s commitment to President Duterte,” read the statement from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).However, a DFA official said Chinese government will choose the pharmaceutical firm for the donated vaccines.
“Since it is a donation, it will be up to the donor normally to determine which companies the vaccine will come from, but China has said it will take into consideration our side’s needs,” Foreign Affairs executive director for strategic communications Ivy Banzon-Abalos said in a message to reporters, when asked which vaccine will be donated from China.
So far, the Philippines made an agreement with China’s pharmaceutical firm, Sinovac. The vaccines from Sinovac are expected to arrive by February.
Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinopharm, however, has yet to give its decision on conducting vaccine trials in the Philippines.
Aside from the vaccine donation, the two countries also signed the Philippines-China Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation, which has 500 million in Chinese currency renminbi worth of grant.
“The agreement makes available a grant of 500 million RMB to finance livelihood projects, infrastructure facilities, feasibility studies for major projects and other mutually agreed projects,” said DFA.
China said it would also ramp up collaboration on the infrastructure projects of Philippine government’s Build Build Build program.

https://business.inquirer.net/318078/ph-seeks-700-m-adb-aiib-loans-for-vaccine-rollout,"PH seeks $700-M ADB, AIIB loans for vaccine rollout",Ben O. de Vera,2021-02-20 04:55:00,"The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will lend the Philippines a combined $700 million (about P33.9 billion) by March to buy vaccines and inoculate Filipinos against the COVID-19 disease.
Documents of the Beijing-based AIIB showed that it plans to shell out $300 million on top of the Manila-based ADB’s commitment of $400 million for their co-financing of the Second Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19 or “HEAL 2” Project.With a total project cost of $764.17 million (about P37 billion), the government will shoulder the balance that the forthcoming ADB and AIIB loans will not cover.
The AIIB said its share coming from the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility it established last year to fight the pandemic would help the Philippine government undertake “rapid procurement of eligible COVID-19 vaccines.”
Since the project will be co-financed with the ADB, the vaccines must be eligible under the regional program called Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility.
Low-interest loans
Last year, the AIIB and the ADB also jointly financed the Philippines’ pandemic response under the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program, chipping in $750 million and $1.5 billion, respectively.
Together with the incoming World Bank loan amounting to $500 million, the three multilateral lenders will inject a total of $1.2 billion into the Philippines COVID-19 vaccination program.
Since the P70 billion in unprogrammed appropriations in the 2021 national budget that had been set aside for mass vaccination would mostly come from foreign borrowings, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III told President Duterte last month that the Philippines would tap up to $1.3 billion in low-interest loans from the ADB, the AIIB as well as the Washington-based World Bank.
Last year, the Philippines secured $15.44 billion in foreign loans and grants to beef up its war chest against the health and socioeconomic crises inflicted by COVID-19.
While borrowings surged, the Philippines will settle a record P1.79 trillion in debt this year, a sizable portion of the P4.51-trillion budget.

MANILA, Philippines — Following a delay, 487,200 doses ofCovid-19 vaccines developed by British-Swede pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca will arrive in the Philippines on Thursday, March 4, Malacañang said Wednesday.
“This is to confirm that the Philippines is set to receive 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines tomorrow, March 4, 2021, 7:30 PM, as part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX facility,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement.Some 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, but encountered delay due to “supply problems.”
President Rodrigo Duterte will personally witness the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility, Roque earlier said.
The Philippines is expected to receive at least 5.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca via the COVAX facility within the first quarter of 2021.
The country started on Monday its mass vaccination program to beat the further spread of Covid-19, following the delivery of 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s vaccine, CoronaVac, donated by the Chinese government.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1401205/pgh-director-is-phs-first-covid-19-vaccine-recipient,PGH director is PH’s first Covid-19 vaccine recipient,Krissy Aguilar,2021-03-01 09:46:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has given its first Covid-19 vaccine to Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi.Legaspi received the vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech on Monday at the PGH.
PGH nurse Chareluck Santos administered the vaccine to Legaspi.
Other government officials who were also inoculated with Sinovac’s vaccine, CoronaVac, include Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Benhur Abalos, and National Task Force against Covid-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon.
In a briefing, Legaspi noted that his decision to get the vaccines was based on “nothing else but science.”
“Nakadesisyon po tayo sa Sinovac base sa siyensya. Sinabi ko po sa town hall, alisin natin ang ating view sa vaccine, hiwalay sa pulitika, hiwala sa partido, hiwalay sa administrasyon, hiwalay sa paniniwala kundi batay sa siyensya na malinaw,” Legaspi said, recalling a town hall meeting attended by PGH’s health workers.
(We decided on Sinovac based on science. I told the town hall meeting, let’s remove our view on the vaccine, separate from politics, party, administration, whatever belief. Let’s base it on science that is clear.)
Legaspi expressed confidence that FDA’s Domingo and the vaccine expert panel will not approve a vaccine that is not safe.
“Hindi po ganon kaganda sa pananaw ng karamihan pero kapag sinuri ninyo nang mas malalim, maiintindihan po ninyo bakit ako ang una nag-volunteer magpabakuna,” Legaspi said.
(It may not be good in a lot of people’s opinion but if you examine it deeper, you will understand why I volunteered to be first to get vaccinated.)“Katulad po ng sinabi ko, ang akin pong pananaw ay hango sa aking paniniwala sa datos at walang ibang basehan po,” he went on.
(Just like what I said, my view is based on data and nothing more.)
The Philippines rolled out its vaccination program after receiving 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine from the Chinese government.
A million more doses are expected to arrive this month, a representative of Sinovac Biotech said.

https://globalnation.inquirer.net/194031/fwd-exchanging-filipino-nurses-for-covid-19-vaccines-not-a-good-recommendation-says-solon,Solon: Exchanging Filipino nurses for Covid vaccines ‘not a good recommendation’,Neil Arwin Mercado,2021-02-24 12:14:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Labor and Employment’s (DOLE) offer to deploy more Filipino nurses and other health care workers to the United Kingdom and Germany in exchange for Covid-19 vaccines is “not a good recommendation,” Quezon 4th District Rep. Helen Tan said Wednesday.
Tan, who chairs the House committee on health, opposed DOLE’s offer as she underscored the need for healthcare workers in the Philippines.“No, I hope DOLE is aware that we are in great need of more health care workers [especially] nurses in the different levels of health care facilities. This will mean widening the gaps on health care services,” Tan said in a text message when asked about the offer.
“Although we cannot prevent nurses from leaving the country [because] of better opportunities abroad, still the idea of exchanging them to Covid vaccines is not a good recommendation,” she added.
Tan said the government “can find other ways to have access to Covid vaccines.”
Meanwhile, Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite said the offer to trade Filipino nurses for vaccines “exposes further the utter desperation of the Duterte government in procuring vaccines.”
“It’s a shame that we’ve reached this point that we are ‘commodifying’ our nurses just to get our supply of vaccines. Mga nurse natin ngayon ang magiging kabayaran sa kapalpakan ng pamahalaang ito,” Gaite said in a statement.
Gaite said the nurses are “being held hostage so they can be used as a bargaining chip.”
“Instead of seeing them like trading goods, let’s treat them as workers with dignity and heed their demands for regular jobs, appropriate compensation, and safe working conditions,” Gaite said.
Gabriela Partylist Rep. Arlene Brosas, meanwhile, said the offer was a “desperate attempt to patch up its incompetence in securing vaccines for the Filipino people, including overseas Filipino workers.”
“We should not even have to negotiate this way in the bid to acquire COVID-19 vaccines. Bakit kailangang i-barter ang mas malaking nurse deployment para sa bakuna sa ating mga OFWs?” Brosas said.(Why do we have to barter for more nurse deployment for the vaccines of our OFWs?)
DOLE earlier requested the UK and Germany to provide the Philippines with Covid-19 vaccines in exchange for exemption from the 5,000 per year limit on deployment of Filipino nurses and other health care workers.
International Labor Affairs Bureau Director Alice Visperas said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III has spoken with the UK ambassador to the Philippines regarding the deal.
Visperas said that if the UK and Germany would grant the request of DOLE, the vaccines would go to OFWs who were already repatriated and those who are departing for jobs abroad.

“The Russian side is ready to closely cooperate with the Philippine partners in this field,” Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev told reporters in an online press briefing.According to the ambassador, proposals for the clinical trials as well as the production of the vaccine in the Philippines have already been submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and [are] now “under consideration.”
“We have three options for cooperations. First, clinical trials, if our Philippine partners consider it necessary. The second option: We are ready to supply the vaccine to the Philippines. The third option is local production of vaccines here on Philippine soil,” Khovaev said.
“It means that we are ready to combine our efforts, we are ready to make necessary investments together with our Philippine partners and we are ready to share our technologies simply because we want to build a robust partnership between our two nations,” he added.
Russia is now only waiting for an official from the Philippine government, he said.
“We don’t make promises. We make suggestions. Suggestions based on what we already have, we have already done…Our offer is under consideration for our Philippine partners so we are waiting for the feedback,” he added.
‘Effective, safe’
Khovaev also gave assurances that the vaccine being developed by Russia is “effective and safe.”
He said the vaccine was tested on several volunteers and Russian scientists, all of whom have “healed well,” the envoy said.
“All of them were tested on these vaccines and all of them feel well,” he added.
“So, according to the analysis of our scientists, the results of the trials are very promising, very positive…The vaccine is effective and safe,” he further said.Moreover, Khovaev said his government is willing to comply with any necessary vaccine distribution procedure imposed by the Philippine government should Manila accept Russia’s offer.
“We fully understand that you Filipinos have your own procedures in this field and all these procedures should be complied with. Of course, we comply with all domestic procedures in the Philippines,” he added.
According to Khovaev, around 20 countries have already confirmed their interest to “closely cooperate” with Russia in terms of the COVID-19 vaccine.
When asked about the status of Russia’s offer to the Philippines, the DFA said the proposals have already been referred to the appropriate agencies “for proper assessment and evaluation.”
“The DFA conveys its appreciation for Russia’s willingness to assist the Philippines in its fight against COVID-19, as well as its offer to supply the SARS-COV-2 vaccine developed by N.F. Gamaleya of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation,” the DFA said in a message to reporters.
The Philippine government has already reached out to various COVID-19 vaccine developers from the United States, Taiwan, China, and the United Kingdom for possible purchase once vaccines have been found and become available.
Over 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are currently in development worldwide.
Earlier, Russia said it aims to launch mass production of a COVID-19 vaccine in September and turn out “several million” doses per month by next year.
But after Moscow announced plans to start swiftly producing COVID-19 jabs, the World Health Organization urged the said country to follow the established guidelines for producing safe and effective vaccines. (With reports from Reuters)

MANILA, Philippines — Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi will be the first among workers in the hospital to receive on Monday the CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’sSinovac Biotech.
“The first recipient will be our director, Director Gap Legaspi, and thenthere are some other like Dr. Edsel Salvaña, he’s an infectious disease specialist and then there are other consultants here whom we think have probably a lot of convincing power,” Dr. Jonas del Rosario, PGH spokespersonsaid in an interview on ABS-CBN News Channel.Del Rosario, a Covid-19 survivor, was supposed to receive the first coronavirus vaccine but he said he was informed that the amount of his antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, is still high.
“They tested my antibodies again a couple of days [ago] and it was quite high. They told me you can wait, you are not the priority at this time,” he said.
Del Rosario said there are 100 identified vaccinees at the PGH this Monday.He also said that there are almost 6,000 vaccinees in PGH, regardless of the vaccine brand.
“Regardless of the vaccines, we have about almost close to 6,000 recipients. That would be from the doctors, nurses, down to support staff, administrative personnel, janitorial services, all of those about 6,000. So far we have as an allocation of 1,000 [doses] for Sinovac at least for the first few days just to see and if the numbers go up, we will ask for more,” he added.
The donated 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine from China arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, with the doses transported to the PGH, Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center early Monday morning.

https://business.inquirer.net/317831/indemnity-for-vaccine-side-effects,Indemnity for vaccine side effects,Raul J. Palabrica,2021-02-16 04:01:00,"The delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines is being held in abeyance pending Congress’ enactment of an indemnification law.
That statement was made by Carlito Galvez Jr., the government’s point person on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, in a Senate hearing last week. He said that law was aimed at giving compensation to persons who may develop serious side effects from the vaccine.Under the proposed law, an indemnity fund would be established by companies that would supply the government with COVID-19 vaccines by depositing one percent of their contract price with the national treasury. The fund would be managed by a Vaccines Compensation Board.
By requiring an indemnification law prior to the delivery of its vaccine, Pfizer wants to shield itself from possible damage suits in case its vaccine gives rise to serious medical issues to its recipient.
If Pfizer’s indemnification scheme passes muster in Congress, all suppliers of government-authorized COVID-19 vaccines would benefit from it.
The law would, in effect, shift the burden of compensating Filipinos who may suffer from vaccine-related illnesses from the pharmaceutical companies to the government.
Pfizer cannot be faulted for thinking ahead before delivering its vaccine. Apparently, it does not want to find itself in the situation that fellow pharmaceutical company, Sanofi Pasteur Inc., is in at present in connection with deaths allegedly caused by Sanofi’s dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia.
Recall that in 2017, Persida Acosta, the head of the Public Attorney’s Office, filed civil and criminal suits against the local branch of Sanofi and former officials of the Department of Health who approved Dengvaxia’s use. The cases are still pending in court.
The business sector should take interest in the proposed indemnification fund. Although the COVID-19 vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies have received approval from their regulators, there are lingering doubts about their efficacy to persons at certain age levels and to virus variants that have recently emerged.
Despite those concerns, however, some private companies have been making arrangements, on their own, with pharmaceutical companies.
Due to the delicate nature of the vaccine, not to mention its high cost, it is reasonable to assume these companies will strictly comply with the prescribed protocols on their delivery, storage and injection.If none of the employees who were injected do not suffer any serious side effects, well and good. The company and its employees can enjoy the comfort of a safe work environment.
But sometimes good intentions do not translate to good results.
In case (knock on wood) an employee injected with the vaccine develops serious medical side effects, would the company be obliged to provide him or her with the medical treatment needed to bring him or her back to good health?
Strictly speaking, since the side effects came from the vaccine administered by the company, it can be held liable for the adverse effects of the injection. That would mean paying for the employee’s hospital bills and medicines and, probably, giving him or her leave with pay.
The unintended or unexpected consequences of a vaccine gone wrong could put an additional financial burden on any company, more so if it is hardly able to keep its nose out of the water.
If only for humanitarian reasons, however, desisting from giving employees the vaccine when the company can afford it because of possible post-injection expenses may not be a good move.
In anticipation of any government-approved vaccine procured by the companies for their employees could result in serious medical side effects, the business sector should lobby in Congress for the inclusion of their employees in the indemnification fund.
The fact that the companies did not go through the government procurement system in securing vaccines should not disqualify their staff from enjoying the benefits of the fund. The companies should even be commended for not using government funds to buy the vaccines.
Lest we forget, employees of private companies are Filipino citizens, too, who are entitled to assistance and protection from the government. INQ

https://globalnation.inquirer.net/194012/ph-asks-uk-germany-for-covid-19-vaccines-in-exchange-of-exemption-from-healthcare-workers-deployment-cap-2,"PH asks UK and Germany for COVID-19 vaccines, offers quid pro quo",Cathrine Gonzales,2021-02-23 21:35:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) is requesting the United Kingdom and Germany to provide the Philippines with Covid-19 vaccines in exchange for exemption from the 5,000 per year limit on deployment of Filipino nurses and other health care workers.
International Labor Affairs Bureau Director Alice Visperas said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III has spoken with the UK ambassador to the Philippines regarding the deal.Visperas said among the requests made by Bello to the UK government in exchange for the exemption on the deployment cap are the renewal of the 2002 and 2003 bilateral labor agreements between the UK and the Philippines, as well as the provision of vaccines.
READ: UK, Germany want exemption from deployment limit of Filipino healthcare workers
“Pangalawa, ‘yung hiling ni Secretary Bello na vaccine mula sa kanilang gobyerno ay mabigyan tayo dito sa Pilipinas lalong-lalo na para sa ating mga OFWs (overseas Filipino workers),” she said in an online media forum on Monday as she enumerated the requests made by the Labor Secretary.
(The second request of Secretary Bello is the provision of vaccines from the UK government to the Philippines, especially for OFWs.)
She added that the DOLE had requested the same from Germany.
According to Visperas, Bello is considering exempting the two countries from the deployment cap if they will agree to the conditions set by the Philippine government.
She said that if the UK and Germany would grant the request of DOLE, the vaccines would go to OFWs who were already repatriated and those who are departing for jobs abroad.
Visperas also said no specific number of doses for the vaccines was mentioned, but added that the jabs may benefit around 600,000 OFWs since this is the number of overseas workers who were already repatriated or are again planning to leave the country.

https://business.inquirer.net/314077/ph-adb-in-talks-for-400-500m-vaccine-procurement-financing,"PH, ADB in talks for $400-500M vaccine procurement financing",Ben O. de Vera,2020-12-16 15:45:00,"MANILA, Philippines — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will lend to its host-country the Philippines at least $9.4 billion — possibly including about $400-500 million for COVID-19 vaccine procurement — in the next three years so the economy can bounce back from what seemed to be a slow recovery from the pandemic-induced recession so far.
ADB vice president Ahmed M. Saeed said in a statement Wednesday, about two-thirds of the Manila-based multilateral lender’s Country Operations Business Plan 2021–2023 for the Philippines will support financing for infrastructure development, health care, and jobs recovery.Oscar Amiel A. Badiola, senior programs officer at the ADB’s Philippines country office, told a press briefing Wednesday that the lender extended to the Philippines a record-high $4.2 billion across 11 loans, of which the bulk had been geared towards immediate COVID-19 response.
For 2021, the ADB plans to lend the Philippines a total of $3.57 billion across seven programs and projects, plus $800-million worth in five projects still on standby.
Among the loans up for ADB approval next year were the $1.75-billion South Commuter Railway Project, Tranche 1; $500-million Building Up Implementation and Local Level Drivers for Universal Health Care; $400-million Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition, Subprogram 3; $400-million Local Governance Reform Program, Subprogram 2; $238-million Davao Public Transport Modernization Project; $180-million Metro Manila Bridges Project; and $100-million Sustainable Tourism Development Project.
The projects on standby for possible ADB financing next year included the $400-million Integrated Flood Risk Management Sector Project, Phase 1, and $100 million in loans each for the following: Baguio City Sanitation Improvement Project; Integrating Innovation System in Philippine Technical and Vocational Education and Training; Mindanao Agro-Enterprise Development Project; and Mindanao Irrigation Development Project, Phase 1.
Also, country director for the Philippines Kelly Bird said the ADB and the Philippine government were currently in talks to tap the new $9-billion Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), under which member-countries can borrow $400-500 million for their COVID-19 vaccine procurement and rollout, next year.
In case their discussions with the Philippines prosper, Bird said the APVAX financing will be over and above the ADB’s 2021 lending pipeline. “We are committed to supporting the Philippines in financing COVID-19 vaccines,” he said.
Bird said the availability of vaccines will be a “big game-changer” to the economic outlook as inoculation would accelerate the resumption of business and consumer confidence upon containing the deadly coronavirus.
The ADB projected a record 8.5-percent contraction in the Philippines’ gross domestic product (GDP) this year before a rebound of 6.5-percent growth next year.
For 2022, the ADB’s pipeline of loans for the Philippines amounted to at least $2.92 billion, on top of a slightly bigger $2.95 billion in 2023.Bird noted that while there were “promising” green shoots being observed in recent manufacturing, goods exports, consumer spending, and cash remittances data, the recovery thus far had been “slow and fragile.”
The longest and most stringent COVID-19 lockdown in the region not only pushed the economy into a recession but also would inflict a severe impact on the labor market and reverse gains in poverty reduction, Bird said.
The ADB expects the unemployment rate to remain elevated at 8-9 percent during the first half of next year, Bird said, as the bigger share of new jobs were expected to be “lower quality” employment in the informal sector.
As such, the poverty incidence rate may rise to 20.7 percent this year from a low of 16.7 percent in 2018, Bird added.

In a statement on Friday, the DOF said outgoing Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev mentioned during his farewell courtesy call to Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III last Tuesday “the possibility of producing and distributing in the Philippines the vaccine developed by Russia.”Early this month, Khovaev told a business forum that the bilateral deal, which Russia had proposed to the Philippine government involved joint clinical trials as well as immediate provisioning of vaccine supplies here after the third and final phases and regulatory approval.
The Philippines is supposedly being eyed to become the production hub for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine in Southeast Asia.
Besides cooperation in vaccine production, Russia and the Philippines were also eyeing “possible agreement on energy cooperation to help boost the Philippines’ power generation capacity,” the DOF said.
Dominguez had said last year that Russian investors were keen on developing power infrastructure projects, including wind farms, in the Philippines following President Duter­te’s visit to Russia.
At that time, the Philippines and Russia also signed a memorandum of intent to explore the possible construction of nuclear power plants here.
The President recently sought consultations to possibly reopen the mothballed Bataan nuclear power plant.
Another area of cooperation discussed by Dominguez and Khovaev was in tax administration, including “a possible cooperation agreement between the Philippine Bureau of Customs and the Federal Customs Service of Russia,” the DOF said.
Dominguez also asked Russia to help the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) establish an efficient value-added tax (VAT) collection system.
In turn, Khovaev was quoted by the DOF as saying that “Russia has shared its VAT-collection technology with other countries and would assist the BIR in its effort to improve its system.”

MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte was not asking for free vaccines, but only wanted the Philippines to have a guaranteed share when he threatened to continue with the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) if the US could not provide its COVID-19 vaccines to the country, Malacañang clarified on Sunday.
Duterte, in a speech on Saturday night, demanded at least 20 million doses of coronavirus vaccines from the U.S. to lift the termination of the VFA. 
“Hindi po, babayaran po natin. Ang problema lang po, yung supply. Ang sinasabi ng Presidente, at least bigyan niyo kami ng supply. Hindi naman tayo nanlilimos, meron naman tayong perang pambayad dyan at babayaran natin,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in an interview over Teleradyo.
(No, we will pay. The problem is the supply. The President is saying that they should at least give us a supply. We’re not begging, we have money to pay for that and we will pay.)

“Sa katunayan, mga pribadong sektor, mga lokal na pamahalaan, sila mismo ay nagbubudget para bumili. Kaya lang, yung supply ang pinaguusapan. So yun po yun. Hindi tayo humihingi ng libre, magbabayad tayo. Kailangan bigyan tayo ng supply gaya naman nung napagkasunduan ng ibang nauna,” he added.
(In fact, the private sectors and local government units are setting aside a budget to procure the vaccines. But the supply is what we’re talking about. That’s it. We’re not asking for free vaccines, we will pay. They should give us a supply just like their agreements with those who secured them first.)
It was in February when the Philippine government, upon instruction of Duterte, sent a notice to the U.S. embassy to terminate the VFA. It was supposed to take effect in August.

However, the scrapping of VFA was shelved for six months in June. The six-month suspension ends this December.
“Kung kinakailangan nilang ma-renew yung kanilang VFA para sa kanilang pangnasyonal na interes, importante sa Pilipinas na mabigay naman sila ng vaccine dahil yan ang kinakailangan natin para sa nasyonal na interes,” Roque said.
(If they want to renew their VFA for their national interest, it is important for the Philippines to secure their vaccines because that’s our national interest.)
“Yan po yung ibig sabihin ng Presidente, na hindi na po siya papayag na para bang tayo’y ina-under lang ng isang dating colonial nating master. So kailangan patas ang relasyon natin at kung hindi mabibigay ang vaccine sa atin, goodbye VFA ang sabi po ni Presidente,” he added.
(That’s what the President meant. He won’t allow for us to be under our former colonial masters. Our relationship should be fair and if the vaccine supply is not given to us, the President says we bid goodbye to the VFA.)

MANILA, Philippines — Although negotiations are still ongoing, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Philippines is already looking at sourcing up to 50 million dosages of COVID-19 vaccines being developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech.
“Tinitignan po natin unang una doon sa China, Sinovac, isa po ito sa mga sources natin na more or less 20 to 50 million doses ang kukunin natin doon,” said Galvez, who is also the country’s pandemic response chief implementer, in a televised briefing.(We are looking at China’s Sinovac as one of the sources, securing more or less 20 to 50 million doses.)
Galvez said the Philippines is also threshing out agreements on vaccines being developed by the United Kingdom, India, Australia, and more.
“Kumukuha po tayo ng portfolio of access sa different vaccine producers at saka mga countries para po at least meron tayong five to six na countries na pagkukunan po nito,” Galvez said.
(We are getting a portfolio of access from different vaccine producers and countries so that we could have at least five to six countries to source the vaccines.)
China’s Sinovac has already submitted to the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration its application to conduct Phase 3 of clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
The Philippines is targeting to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos against the new coronavirus to achieve herd immunity wherein enough people in a specific area are protected against infectious disease.

MANILA, Philippines — British drug maker AstraZeneca has already submitted the necessary documents to Philippine health authorities to secure approval in conducting clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said this Wednesday, just days after AstraZeneca announced that its COVID-19 vaccine can be 90% effective.“They already submitted their documents to our Vaccine Experts Panel last November 16, during that time may kulang pa [they still have deficiencies],” Vergeire told reporters in an online media briefing.
“Immediately, last November 18, they were able to complete all the documentary requirements. So the evaluation of our vaccine experts panel and Ethics Review Board can now start,” she added.
Should AstraZeneca passed the panel’s initial evaluation, it will then secure the approval of the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines before it can proceed with its clinical trials here.
Philippine vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier bared that the country is in advance talks with the British firm to supply at least 20 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine.
Galvez said the Philippine government could enter into an advance market agreement with AstraZeneca before the end of November.
China’s Sinovac Biotech is the first drug maker to get the Philippine panel’s green light. The panel is also evaluating the COVID-19 vaccines of Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen subsidiary for late-stage trials.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1401139/coronavac-rollout-begins-astra-delayed,CoronaVac rollout begins; AstraZeneca delayed,Maricar Cinco,2021-03-01 05:00:00,"FINALLY The Philippines’ vaccination drive starts on Monday with the delivery of the initial 600,000 doses of the China-made CoronaVac vaccine, here being unloaded from a Chinese military plane and loaded onto a refrigerated van at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on Sunday afternoon. —RICHARD A. REYES
The Philippines begins its COVID-19 vaccination drive on Monday with the first 600,000 doses of the donated Chinese vaccine CoronaVac in major government hospitals in Metro Manila.
The country has been expecting a bigger launch, but the delivery of 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the global vaccine supply pool COVAX on Monday will be delayed by a week due to a supply problem, according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.President Duterte attended a ceremony to mark the arrival of the initial 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on Sunday afternoon. A Chinese military aircraft delivered the vaccines.
“With this very important shipment, I am confident that more batches of vaccines will be available with great dispatch until every Filipino will be given the chance to be vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity,” Mr. Duterte said.
The President said the Chinese donation underscored the friendly relations between Manila and Beijing.
“I convey my sincere gratitude to the Chinese people and the government of China for this gesture of friendship and solidarity—the hallmark of Philippines-China partnership,” Mr. Duterte said.
Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said “more Chinese vaccines procured by the Philippine government will surely come soon as expected.”
He was referring to 25 million doses of CoronaVac due to be delivered to the Philippines in batches this year.
“It is a fine tradition between China and the Philippines to help each other in trying times. Our two governments and peoples have helped each other and joined hands to fight the pandemic since the outbreak of the virus, forging a closer China-Philippines partnership,” Huang said.
With the arrival of the Sinovac vaccine, the Philippines’ vaccine rollout formally starts, said Carlito Galvez Jr., head of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and chief implementer of the vaccination program.
President Duterte ordered the first round of vaccinations to begin in the first week of March, after the delivery in February of the 117,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine from COVAX was delayed.Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, the Senate health committee chair who is a former aide to the President, said vaccines for the Visayas and Mindanao would also arrive this month.
Duque announced the delay in the delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccines in a television interview later Sunday.
“We received communication earlier today that the delivery would be delayed by about a week,” Duque said. He quoted the World Health Organization (WHO) as saying the delay was due to a supply problem.
Waiting for AstraZeneca
Galvez said the AstraZeneca vaccines were part of the 5.5 million to 9 million doses the Philippines had requested from COVAX, a vaccine sharing scheme led by the WHO and the vaccine alliance GAVI to ensure an equitable vaccine supply to poor countries.
The AstraZeneca vaccine offers front-line health workers an option as they decide whether to get inoculated.
Many of them said they were willing to wait for the British-Swedish drug and step aside from the queue for CoronaVac, which had been found only 50.4 percent effective in protecting health workers in the COVID-19 wards.
Dr. Tony Leachon, a health advocate and former consultant to the government’s pandemic managers, lauded the government effort, but said “I’d like to wait for AstraZeneca for the following reasons: higher efficacy rate, track record of the company, clinical study published in peer reviewed journal, [and] clinical studies reviewed and endorsed by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC).”
“The fact that [health-care workers] now have a choice is better because the overarching consideration is to have them protected in the soonest possible time. They won’t feel forced if they didn’t like the other [brand],” Dr. Gene Nisperos of the Community Medicine Development Foundation said.
SOLIDARITY President Duterte (fourth from right), here speaking with Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian on Sunday afternoon, hails China’s delivery of an initial 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac as a “gesture of friendship and solidarity.” —RICHARD A. REYES
Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 said its members would also await the HTAC recommendation. It “will help us decide if we will accept [CoronaVac],” said Dr. Antonio Dans, spokesperson for the group.
Dans said HTAC, an independent council of medical experts that advises the Department of Health (DOH), is set to review Sinovac’s trial data this week.
Regardless of the brand, Dans said, “as long as it is [approved by] the Food and Drug Administration and HTAC, we believe the best vaccine is the one in your arm.”
Dr. Jonas del Rosario, spokesperson for Philippine General Hospital (PGH), said the latest survey of the hospital’s personnel showed 12 percent of the staff were willing to be inoculated with CoronaVac.
“This is only voluntary. We won’t force it on anyone. The doctors, nurses and other PGH employees have the right of refusal,” said Del Rosario, a COVID-19 survivor who lost both parents to the disease. It was announced earlier that he would be the first to get inoculated at the hospital.
100K shots for military
Of the 600,000 doses of CoronaVac that arrived on Sunday, 100,000 doses will go to the military. The rest will be given to health workers.
Five to six police-escorted refrigerated vans transported the CoronaVac shots delivered on Sunday through C5 Road to the MetroPac Movers Inc. (MMI), a third-party logistics and storage provider of the DOH at Barangay Concepcion I in Marikina City.
From MMI, a few hundred doses were transported late in the evening to PGH, Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center.
Simultaneous “symbolic” vaccinations in the six hospitals are scheduled at 9 a.m. on Monday, with Duque and Galvez standing first in line at the Lung Center and at the PGH, respectively, Go said in a radio interview on Sunday.
But President Duterte told reporters later that he and his top officials would be inoculated later with another China-made vaccine that he did not name.
The President said his doctor thought he should get another brand.
“It’s a Chinese brand, but not [CoronaVac], he said.
Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro said he also offered MMI for the storage of AstraZeneca vaccines, because of its proximity to hospitals in Metro Manila.
A DOH source said the Sinovac vaccines did not come with syringes, but the DOH was providing auto-disable 0.5 ml syringes for the first round of vaccinations.
Dr. Rommel Lobo of the National Adverse Effect Following Immunization Committee said hospitals’ supply of epinephrine, a common drug for treatment in case of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction, was enough.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has reserved six million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson, Manila’s top diplomat in the United States said Monday.
Philippine Ambassador to the U.S. Jose Romualdez, the Philippine government is currently in talks with the company.“Kausap na natin yung Johnson & Johnson. Alam natin na in-approve lang yan dito sa America. Meron tayong six million na naka-reserve sa Johnson & Johnson,” Romualdez said in an interview over Teleradyo.
(We are talking with Johnson & Johnson. We know they just received authorization here in the US. We have six million doses reserved.)

He said the vaccine doses could be delivered to the country by the second half of the year.
“Iyan dadating ng mga second half of this year siyempre kasi yung production diyan e medyo ngayon pa lang maguumpisa ng full production,” the envoy said.
(These will arrive in the second half of this year, of course, because they just started their full production.)
Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine recently secured an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In Johnson & Johnson’s 44,000-person global trial, the vaccine was found to be 66% effective at preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 four weeks after inoculation, and 100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death due to the virus.
There were very few serious side effects reported in the trial, which also offered preliminary evidence that the vaccine reduced asymptomatic infections.
If that proves to be the case, it would mean COVID-19 vaccines may indeed reduce virus transmission as well as illness.So far, the Philippines has received 600,000 doses of the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China-based Sinovac as a donation from the Chinese government.
The country was also supposed to receive 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine on Monday as part of the first round of allocated doses from the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility.
The delivery, however, will be delayed by one week due to global supply issues, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. With a report from Reuters

Duterte said the number of supplies to be given is still in talks and noted that clinical studies will still have to be made.
The President said he would be the first to be experimented by volunteering to take it in public.
Duterte tasked the Department of Health to coordinate with Russia on the transfer of technology for a possible vaccine against COVID-19.
“I don’t think Russia will renege on its promise and so I am asking the Secretary of Health to look for the best guy to be dealing with Russia in this area–the transfer of technology of the vaccine,” Duterte said.
The President expressed thanks to Russia and assured that the two nations will remain “friends forever.”
Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev earlier said Russia is ready to supply the country with COVID-19 vaccines.
Khovaev assured the trials of the vaccine were turning out “promising” and that it is “effective and safe.”[ac]

MANILA, Philippines — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will “give his best try”to get even a fraction of the 10 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for the Philippines, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro. Locsin Jr. said aftera recent conversation with the ranking US government official.
Great phone conversation with Mike Pompeo last night. Lotsa laughs at others. But on the most serious note I asked him to help Babe and I get back even a fraction of the 10 million doses of Pfizer after someone dropped the ball. He’ll give it his best try. Babe’s securing Moderna
— Teddy Locsin Jr. (@teddyboylocsin) December 19, 2020
In a tweet, Locsin bared that he had a “great phone conversation” with Pompeo the night before.“Lotsa laughs at others. But on the most serious note I asked him to help Babe and I get back even a fraction of the 10 million doses of Pfizer after someone dropped the ball. He’ll give it his best try,” Locsin said.
It was also Locsin who previously bared that “someone dropped the ball” as the Philippines was supposed to get 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, however, denied that someone “dropped the ball” in acquiring the vaccines, saying that the government’s negotiation with Pfizer is ongoing.
Senator Panfilo Lacson, meanwhile, said that he was able to talk to Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez about the official to “dropped the ball” on the vaccine deal, adding that Duque was not able to work on the documentary requirements needed.
Aside from the Pfizer vaccine deal, Locsin also bared that the ambassador was also working on securing vaccine doses from Moderna.
Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine was the second to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Moderna’s vaccines may be expected for delivery to the Philippines in mid-2021, according to Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Romualdez.“I am please to share that, following months of discussions with Moderna, the Philippines is in the final stages of negotiating for the supply of a minimum of 10 million doses of mRNA-1273, the company’s vaccines, with the option to purchase an additional 10 million doses, for delivery beginning in mid-2021,” Romualdez said in a statement posted by the embassy over Twitter on Wednesday.
Last December, Romualdez said Moderna and another company, Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc., are willing to supply up to 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines in the third quarter of 2021.
“I welcome the pledge of support of the private sector led by ICTSI’s Enrique Razon in shipping and distributing the vaccines from the manufacturing facility in Spain to the Philippines at no cost to the Philippine government,” Romualdez went on.
National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 chief and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said the government is eyeing to secure a total of 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within the week.
Galvez said the Philippines has so far secured 30 million doses of the Covovax coronavirus vaccine, which he said is extendible to 40 million doses.
The government has also secured 25 million vaccine doses from China’s Sinovac, 30 million doses of vaccine from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, and 25 million doses of Russia’s Gamaleya or Sputnik V vaccine.
