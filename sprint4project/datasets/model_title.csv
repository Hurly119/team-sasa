https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/why-covid-19-vaccines-not-arrive-philippines,Here’s why COVID-19 vaccines haven’t arrived in the Philippines yet,SOFIA TOMACRUZ,2021-02-18 09:22:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
The Philippine government needs a key measure on indemnification funds to be signed into law
Philippine pandemic officials announced the delivery of the country’s first batch of coronavirus vaccines could be expected by mid-February. But with that timeline looking less likely to be met, the Duterte government’s task force officials announced there would be a slight delay in the arrival of vaccines due to, of all things, paperwork.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr and National Task Force COVID-19 Deputy Chief Implementer Vince Dizon pointed to documentary requirements involving an indemnification fund as the culprit behind the delayed schedule.
Why do we need an indemnification fund?
An indemnification fund, Galvez earlier told lawmakers during congressional hearings, was necessary for the Philippines to gain access to vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies as well as the COVAX global facility.
He requested lawmakers to consider bills that would provide for such in mid-January, adding it could give the Philippines an opportunity to gain access to larger supplies of vaccines and increase public confidence in the government’s rollout.The reason why indemnification funds or programs are required of countries is because vaccines being used worldwide are still under emergency use authorization (EUA), with only limited short-term data available on the full effects that could arise from receiving a shot.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities like COVAX, along with vaccine manufacturers, will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events. This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting vaccines emergency use approval.“You’ll have an indemnification program because there is no full data yet. So if an unexpected adverse event happens, any company cannot be sued because you enter an agreement with the company where you are guaranteeing them that you will take responsibility for any adverse event because you’re aware the data is not complete yet – but you’re allowing its use because there is a national emergency,” said Dr Aileen Espina, a public health and family medicine specialist and member of the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC).
“That’s why we’re particular that for any vaccine that will be used, the benefits outweigh the risks,” she added.
But vaccines aren't here yet. What else should the government do?
On Monday night, February 15, Galvez said that task force for vaccine procurement officials have done their part in submitting requirements needed to facilitate Filipinos’ access to vaccines. This is on top of efforts by the Department of Health.
Specifically, government lawyers have finished fine-tuning details of an indemnification clause with COVAX and are now waiting on the facility, the World Health Organization (WHO), and Pfizer to finalize it. (Among the vaccines expected to arrive in the Philippines in the first quarter of 2021 are those developed by Pfizer, BioNTech, and AstraZeneca.)
On Wednesday, February 17, Galvez said that the Philippine government has already signed onto the agreements.
The vaccine czar said it was now waiting on Congress and the WHO to ensure the availability of an indemnification fund and concur with the Philippines’ proposed indemnification program, respectively.“Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO (The ball is with Congress and the WHO),” Galvez said.
While requirements for vaccines coming from COVAX are steps away from being finalized, lawmakers in Congress will still need to pass measures creating an indemnification program to facilitate access to vaccines purchased through agreements between the Philippines and vaccine manufacturers.
Why are we talking about indemnification only now if it's important?
The government was informed of the indemnification requirement only during the latter phase of vaccine negotiations.
Senator Sonny Angara said on Wednesday, February 17, that this issue was not even raised during the 2021 budget deliberations, ""otherwise, [Congress] would have put a fund on that.""
Galvez first informed the Senate about the need for legislation on the indemnification program during committee of the whole hearings in January. It was only on February 11 that the urgency of this measure was tackled in depth during a public hearing.
Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO.
SECRETARY CARLITO GALVEZ JR
Why do we need a law? Won't this further delay vaccine arrival?
A law is needed to be able to tap into the Contingent Fund, as this expense was not covered under the GAA, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado told Rappler.
National Task Force COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon said a law is also being required by vaccine manufacturers, aside from the COVAX facility, to hold them free from any liabilities for severe adverse effects arising from immunization.
COVAX officials earlier listed this as part of requirements for all countries participating in the global scheme to ensure equitable access to vaccines, saying vaccine manufacturers were reluctant to guarantee supplies if they were not indemnified against possible liability.“Given the unprecedented speed and scope of deployment of recently licensed vaccines, manufacturers have highlighted the risks of unforeseen claims due to injury associated with the vaccine. Manufacturers are reluctant to deliver COVID-19 vaccines if this risk is not addressed,” COVAX said.For countries like the Philippines that will receive donated vaccines from the facility, COVAX said a model indemnification agreement will already be incorporated in agreements with manufacturers to decrease time spent for negotiations.
Where will the government source indemnity payments?
Since there was no allocation in the P4.5-trillion 2021 budget, the Philippine government and Congress have to look where they could source this.
During a February 11 Senate hearing, two options were considered:
For the indemnity payments to be included under PhilHealth's coverage using its funds
Tapping into the P13-billion Contingent Fund in the national budget, which would require a law
During that hearing, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that PhilHealth did not include this in its corporate budget this year, but that the state health insurer will ""study"" the possibility of tapping into its P116-billion reserve funds.
The result of the February 11 hearing is Senate Bill (SB) 2057, which is currently being tackled at the upper chamber's plenary. The bill is proposing the creation of a P500-million indemnification fund to be sourced from the Contingent Fund. This will cover compensation in case of death and medical treatment for vaccine recipients experiencing severe adverse effects.
In the House of Representatives, lawmakers have also filed a counterpart measure through House Bill No. (HB) 8648, which seeks to exempt local government units from bidding requirements under the procurement law, grant tax exemptions for vaccines, and create an indemnification fund for the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.So far, HB 8648 does not include an immunity clause, nor an amount that will be allocated for the indemnification fund.
Who will implement the indemnification program?
According to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, while funds will be administered by PhilHealth, the DOH will be in charge of implementing the indemnification program where adverse events linked to a vaccine may be determined.
This means that if someone were to experience a serious adverse reaction, the DOH, through its post-monitoring of vaccinations, will determine if an adverse effect is indeed linked to the vaccine. If so, PhilHealth would cover the cost of care, with funds sourced from the indemnity fund.

What's the status of pending bills in Congress?
Both Senate and House bills were already sponsored at the plenary. At the upper chamber, interpellations will resume on Monday, February 22, before the Senate version of the indemnification bill is scheduled to be passed on 2nd reading.At the House, amendments to HB 8648 were finalized on Wednesday. It is also up for 2nd reading.
At their current pace, the bills could be passed on final reading during the last week of February or during the first week of March due to the 3-day interval rule between the 2nd and 3rd reading. Since the current versions of the Senate and House bills are different, there's also a chance of a bicameral conference committee (bicam).
If President Rodrigo Duterte certifies the vaccine bill as urgent – as requested by Galvez – Congress can do away with the 3-day interval rule.If the President issues the certification in the last week of February, then there’s a chance that both chambers will also be able to pass the bills on final reading that same week. To further hasten the process, the Senate or the House may need to adopt the other chamber's version, so that a bicam won't be needed. The bill will then be up for signature by the President for it to become law.
Once a law is passed, will we get our vaccine supply immediately?
This will still depend on when the government will sign supply agreements with vaccine firms, as well as the capacity of vaccine manufacturers to deliver doses to all countries that have locked in orders.As it stands, Galvez said only term sheets have been signed with vaccine manufacturers as of mid-February. Term sheets are the second to the last step in vaccine negotiations required to lock in logistics needed for production and delivery.For the last step, a supply agreement will still need to be signed with these companies to facilitate actual purchase and payment, as well as set a definite date for delivery.
Galvez earlier said that current limited global supply has prevented vaccine manufacturers from entering binding supply agreements with the government. – with reports from Mara Cepeda/Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-02-18 09:22:00,"Why do we need an indemnification fund?An indemnification fund, Galvez earlier told lawmakers during congressional hearings, was necessary for the Philippines to gain access to vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies as well as the COVAX global facility.He requested lawmakers to consider bills that would provide for such in mid-January, adding it could give the Philippines an opportunity to gain access to larger supplies of vaccines and increase public confidence in the government’s rollout.The reason why indemnification funds or programs are required of countries is because vaccines being used worldwide are still under emergency use authorization (EUA), with only limited short-term data available on the full effects that could arise from receiving a shot.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities like COVAX, along with vaccine manufacturers, will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events.The vaccine czar said it was now waiting on Congress and the WHO to ensure the availability of an indemnification fund and concur with the Philippines’ proposed indemnification program, respectively.“Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO (The ball is with Congress and the WHO),” Galvez said.While requirements for vaccines coming from COVAX are steps away from being finalized, lawmakers in Congress will still need to pass measures creating an indemnification program to facilitate access to vaccines purchased through agreements between the Philippines and vaccine manufacturers.National Task Force COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon said a law is also being required by vaccine manufacturers, aside from the COVAX facility, to hold them free from any liabilities for severe adverse effects arising from immunization.During a February 11 Senate hearing, two options were considered: For the indemnity payments to be included under PhilHealth's coverage using its funds Tapping into the P13-billion Contingent Fund in the national budget, which would require a law During that hearing, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that PhilHealth did not include this in its corporate budget this year, but that the state health insurer will ""study"" the possibility of tapping into its P116-billion reserve funds.",3.0,0.7214999794960022,"dose, duterte, get, arrive, coronavirus, astrazeneca, pfizer, first, country, palace","['arrive', 'yet']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

(UPDATED) On March 1, the Philippines finally begins to legally roll out COVID-19 vaccines, with the first doses from Sinovac
For nearly a year, President Rodrigo Duterte used speech after speech to claim that salvation from the pandemic would come from one thing only: vaccines. Now, the Philippines is just weeks away from starting an immunization campaign that aims to deliver exactly that.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr outlined the ambitious targets the government had for its vaccine program: secure at least 148 million vaccine doses and inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos within 2021 – just enough to reach the recommended 60% of the population scientists estimated was needed to reach herd immunity against COVID-19.In reaching these goals, Galvez, along with other pandemic and health officials face challenges that have stumped even the wealthiest of countries when distributing vaccines to the public.With the distribution of the country’s first vaccine doses slated for February, the Duterte government’s timeline for its vaccine plan in 2021 hinges on many things – including delivery, storage, local government plans, and drawing up of masterlists – going right.Where things stand now
On Monday, March 1, the Philippines officially began rolling out COVID-19 vaccine doses.At 9:40 am, the first COVID-19 vaccine in the country was legally administered by nurse Sherlock Cruz to Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the few coronavirus-designated hospitals in the country.
Along with Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, government medical adviser Dr Edsel Salvana, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, and deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon were also vaccinated.
To secure vaccines, the Philippine government has been in talks with at least 7 companies, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, Sinovac, Gamaleya, and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica).Galvez said of the 7 companies, there were 5 with whom term sheets have been signed.Term sheets are the second to the last document that needs to be signed. It sees companies commit to supplying doses for Filipinos.Actual delivery and use will depend on details agreed upon in supply deals and whether the vaccine is granted emergency use authorization from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration.As the main person in charge of vaccine negotiations for the Philippines, Galvez said supply deals were scheduled to be signed by the end of February. All contracts for vaccines were expected to be finalized by mid-February, he added.In terms of preparations for the actual deployment of vaccines on the ground, various local government units (LGUs) have been running simulation exercises to rehearse their plans for storing, transporting, and distributing vaccines in their communities.The Department of Health, along with task force officials, approved the vaccines plans of several LGUs in Metro Manila, with more expected to be cleared in the coming weeks.SCREENSHOT FROM NATIONAL TASK FORCE COVID-19
1ST QUARTER: 'Mini rollout'
The first 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine donated by the Chinese government arrived in the Philippines on February 28.Sinovac was the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, following Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Sinovac’s vaccine was the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility, which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February. This included 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine and 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine earlier expected to arrive courtesy of the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization (WHO).
COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila – the epicenter of the pandemic in the country – will be prioritized for the initial vaccine supplies. The following hospitals were listed:Philippine General Hospital
Lung CenterDr Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala)
Veterans Memorial Medical Center
Philippine National Police General Hospital
Victoriano Luna Medical CenterOther vaccines like AstraZeneca which were expected to arrive in the first quarter will likewise be prioritized for frontline health workers caring for patients in high-risk areas or places where infections rates were still high. (The Philippines expected to receive at least 5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine from COVAX.)Galvez said this phase of the government’s vaccine plan will be considered a “mini rollout” as it will cover some 1.7 million healthcare workers, along with other government frontliners who will be responsible for mounting the vaccine rollout in the coming months.2nd QUARTER: Vulnerable sectors, 'economic frontliners'
By this time, the government expects 10 to 15 million doses of vaccines to arrive in the country, on top of more vaccines to be supplied by COVAX.WHO Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasignhe said the country is potentially looking at receiving a maximum of 9.2 million doses by March or April, while the remainder of the 44 million doses it was entitled to through COVAX will come at the end of the year.The 9.2 million doses will be AstraZeneca’s vaccine manufactured in South Korea, though the actual amount will depend on manufacturing capacity, Abeyasinghe said.Galvez said these vaccines will be used to inoculate members of vulnerable sector such as senior citizens and indigent Filipinos. The government is also eyeing to start the vaccination of “economic frontliners.”During these months, supplies of AstraZeneca’s vaccine ordered by the private sector and local government units are also expected to start arriving in the country.MUST READ

3rd QUARTER: 'Massive rollout' begins
At this point, we should expect the Duterte government’s vaccine rollout to be in full swing as bulk of vaccines purchased should start arriving in the Philippines.The number of doses to be made available in these months was somewhere between 30 million to 50 million, Galvez said. The amount would be enough to start inoculating about 25 million Filipinos.Based on negotiations, some of the vaccines that may be delivered during these months include those developed by US pharmaceutical firms Moderna and Novavax.Galvez earlier signed a term sheet securing at least 30 million doses of Novavax vaccine to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, while Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said Moderna was among companies willing to supply doses to the Philippines by mid-2021.4th QUARTER: Targets reached?
In the latter months of the year, what Galvez described as the “full rollout” of vaccines will continue as bulk of vaccines procured through negotiations will be delivered.These months will be crucial if the Duterte government is to reach its goal of inoculating 50 million to 70 million Filipinos. Galvez spelled out the stakes in the campaign, saying the country needed to reach this number if it is to achieve herd immunity and jumpstart economic recovery. – Rappler.com

The Philippines will receive its first shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines on Thursday, March 4, days after logistical concerns and supply problems delayed the delivery of doses originally scheduled for March 1.“This is to confirm that the initial shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines is set to arrive tomorrow,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said on Tuesday, March 3.
Roque said 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine would be handed over to the Philippines on Thursday at 7:30 pm. The latest number of doses to arrive is lower than the 525,600 doses the Philippines had expected to receive on March 1.
Roque did not say why the number of AstraZeneca doses to be delivered on March 4 was lower.
Roque earlier said that President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to witness the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines supplied by the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization.Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr thanked countries including Germany, the Republic of Korea, and European Union for donating to the COVAX facility, saying the Philippines was ""deeply grateful"" for their contribution.
Why this matters
The latest batch of vaccines from the COVAX facility will allow at least 243,00 more health workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A considerable number had turned down Sinovac's vaccine, opting to wait for AstraZeneca’s vaccine to be delivered to the country.
The Philippines earlier received 600,000 Sinovac doses donated by China on February 28, though enthusiasm for the vaccine was muted amid concerns over its lower efficacy and the robustness of its data compared to other vaccines.

(UPDATED) Its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine, after a review of late-stage trial data reaffirmed the shot was safe and effective.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo made the announcement in a virtual press briefing on on Monday, February 22, just a day before Duterte government officials said Sinovac’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines.“After a thorough and rigorous review of the currently available published and unpublished data by our regulatory and medical experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac Life Science Company,” Domingo said.Sinovac is now the third company to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines. Its approval follows that of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s, and may speed up the start of the country’s inoculation campaign set back by delays in paperwork and limited global supply.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Monday that the Chinese embassy in Manila advised Philippine officials it would need 3 to 5 days to prepare for the delivery of vaccines once emergency use for it was issued in the Philippines.Aside from the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil have granted emergency authorization for the Chinese vaccine.Not for use among health workers
While the FDA granted Sinovac’s vaccine emergency approval, Domingo said the FDA’s regulatory and medical experts cited conditions and recommendations for its use in the country.Foremost among these was that experts did not recommend its use among health workers, as the group has high exposure to COVID-19.A review of published and unpublished data on the vaccine from ongoing Phase 3 trials showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2% among healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old. The findings, coming from community trials in Indonesia and Turkey, means the vaccine is a viable option for this group.But its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
“The safety profile is good, adverse events were mild to moderate, and possibility of allergy or anaphylaxis is minimal,” Domingo said in Filipino. “When the vaccines arrive in the country, this can be usedin groups where safety and efficacy is proven – 18 to 59 year old clinically healthy individuals.”
Under scrutiny
The emergency approval of Sinovac’s vaccines comes after Philippine lawmakers in the Senate scrutinized the Duterte government’s seeming preference for the Chinese vaccine despite reportedly higher prices and lower efficacy findings compared to other vaccine options.
Before the EUA was issued, health experts held off on judging the vaccine due to limited publicly available data on late-stage trials. Despite this, some of the government’s expert advisers sought to quell concerns over the country’s decision to consider the vaccine, saying its findings on preventing severe COVID-19 infections and death can contribute toward the government's goal of taming the pandemic.
The use of Sinovac in the Philippines is among the few that will be done from the government’s direct purchase of vaccines. Duque said some 600,000 doses may be delivered before the end of the month.
Domingo stressed that while the FDA granted Sinovac an EUA, it is not full approval. Securing full marketing authority – which is necessary to commercialize and sell the vaccine – would be contingent on Sinovac’s commitment to finish development of the product. – Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-02-22 12:19:00,"FDA Director General Eric Domingo made the announcement in a virtual press briefing on on Monday, February 22, just a day before Duterte government officials said Sinovac’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines.“After a thorough and rigorous review of the currently available published and unpublished data by our regulatory and medical experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac Life Science Company,” Domingo said.Sinovac is now the third company to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines.Its approval follows that of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s, and may speed up the start of the country’s inoculation campaign set back by delays in paperwork and limited global supply.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Monday that the Chinese embassy in Manila advised Philippine officials it would need 3 to 5 days to prepare for the delivery of vaccines once emergency use for it was issued in the Philippines.Aside from the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil have granted emergency authorization for the Chinese vaccine.Not for use among health workers While the FDA granted Sinovac’s vaccine emergency approval, Domingo said the FDA’s regulatory and medical experts cited conditions and recommendations for its use in the country.Foremost among these was that experts did not recommend its use among health workers, as the group has high exposure to COVID-19.A review of published and unpublished data on the vaccine from ongoing Phase 3 trials showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2% among healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old.The findings, coming from community trials in Indonesia and Turkey, means the vaccine is a viable option for this group.But its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector.“When the vaccines arrive in the country, this can be usedin groups where safety and efficacy is proven – 18 to 59 year old clinically healthy individuals.” Under scrutiny The emergency approval of Sinovac’s vaccines comes after Philippine lawmakers in the Senate scrutinized the Duterte government’s seeming preference for the Chinese vaccine despite reportedly higher prices and lower efficacy findings compared to other vaccine options.The use of Sinovac in the Philippines is among the few that will be done from the government’s direct purchase of vaccines.Duque said some 600,000 doses may be delivered before the end of the month.Securing full marketing authority – which is necessary to commercialize and sell the vaccine – would be contingent on Sinovac’s commitment to finish development of the product.",4.0,0.46380001306533813,"vaccination, ph, get, galvez, duterte, first, dose, sinovac, health, supply","['grant', 'emergency', 'approval', 'sinovac']",0.4588,0.283,0.109,0.609,0.0,Positive

The Philippines' first batch of coronavirus vaccines arrived in the country on Sunday, February 28, paving the way for the start of its mass inoculation campaign with shots developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.
The aircraft carrying the vaccines – a transport plane of the People's Liberation Army of China – landed at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City around 4:10 pm on Sunday.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel. That is light at the end of the tunnel,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in an interview with state-run network PTV. ""At least nagsimula na po tayo. At tuluy-tuloy na po."" (At least we have started. And this will continue.)
The delivery of 600,000 doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac – a donation from the Chinese government – was set to be witnessed by President Rodrigo Duterte, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr at the Villamor Air Base.
Malacañang earlier hailed the delivery of Sinovac's vaccine, which would be used to jump-start the country's vaccination campaign in several hospitals across Metro Manila.
Though the Duterte government had targeted to start distributing vaccines by February, the Philippines is now among the last countries in Southeast Asia to start vaccinating its residents. It was the last to receive vaccine doses in the region.
The arrival of the vaccine comes days after the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for CoronaVac last Monday, February 22.
Sinovac is the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, though its vaccine is the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February.
China first announced it would donate vaccines to Filipinos during the official visit of Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Manila last January.
Senator Bong Go, former presidential aide, said on Sunday that Galvez, Duque, and other Cabinet secretaries will be among the first government officials to be vaccinated with Sinovac on Monday, March 1.
Duterte, 75, will not be receiving Sinovac as the FDA, along with government experts, did not recommend its use for senior citizens or those 60 years old and above. Data from late-stage trials had mostly been gathered from participants 18 to 59 years old.
""To my fellow Filipinos, these vaccines are backed by science and deliberated by our Filipino experts. I encourage that you get vaccinated at the soonest possible time and be a partner in preventing the further spread of the disease,"" Duterte said in a speech.
Health workers go first
Aside from several government officials, health workers were identified as a priority to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
In a press conference later on Sunday, Duterte said health workers who refuse to take Sinovac “have a choice,” and can wait for the other vaccines that are set to arrive in the country.
“Kung ayaw nila ng Sinovac, maghintay sila,” he said. “In a few days, there has been quite a… basta I was assured that [AstraZeneca] would be coming within the next few days.”At least 525,600 doses of vaccines developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is expected to arrive in a week, after it was postponed from March 1.
In issuing Sinovac an EUA, the FDA said data from Phase 3 trials in Brazil, where a lower efficacy of 50.4% was observed, led experts not to recommend its use for priority groups. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The recommendation spurred days-long deliberations among experts part of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, who later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, reiterating it is safe and effective.
With vaccine supply scarce and delivery of different brands uncertain, experts said health workers should be given the chance to receive an available vaccine since they are most exposed to COVID-19. In the meantime, health workers who will refuse to get Sinovac were given assurances they would not lose their place in the government's prioritization.The FDA granted emergency approval to Sinovac after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
Aside from the Philippines, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and Laos have granted emergency authorization for Sinovac's CoronaVac. – with reports from Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com

(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision clears the way for the use of a vaccine expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign
The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for the local use of the vaccine that is expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign.The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is the second to be given emergency use approval in the Philippines, where health officials are closely monitoring infections after the detection of the more infectious United Kingdom (UK) variant in the country.Its approval comes nearly two weeks after the FDA gave approval to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine which had been the first to apply for emergency authorization in the country.“After a thorough review of the currently available data, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of AstraZeneca ” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA and that the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Strategic vaccine
AstraZeneca and Oxford’s vaccine is poised to become a dominant shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.
The Philippine government, private sector, and several local governments had earlier entered intro tripartite deals with the drug maker to secure up to 17 million doses of the vaccine for Filipinos. (READ: PH vaccine stockpile from AstraZeneca reaches 17 million doses)
Supplies were expected to arrive sometime in the second quarter of the year, though vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr earlier said that the government was negotiating for an earlier delivery “at the soonest possible time.”
Unlike other vaccines the Philippines eyed to buy, AstraZeneca was among the few companies that have so far expressed willingness to enter into tripartite deals involving local governments and the private sector. Other companies said to be open to the setup are US drug makers Moderna and Novavax.
Health experts earlier said that AstraZeneca’s vaccine would also be easier to distribute inpoorer and harder-to-reach areas, considering it can be transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months, making it compatible with the Department of Health’s (DOH) storage facilities.Early analysis of clinical trial results showed an average efficacy of about 70% after the first dose. The vaccine was seen to be 90% effective in participants who were given a half dose, followed by a full dose. This was compared to 62% efficacy seen in participants who were given two full doses.While the FDA granted AstraZeneca an EUA, it is not yet a full approval.
Securing full marketing authority– which is necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allows its sale in the local market – would be contingent on AstraZeneca’s commitment to finish development of the product. – Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-01-28 11:14:00,"(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision clears the way for the use of a vaccine expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for the local use of the vaccine that is expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign.The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is the second to be given emergency use approval in the Philippines, where health officials are closely monitoring infections after the detection of the more infectious United Kingdom (UK) variant in the country.Its approval comes nearly two weeks after the FDA gave approval to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine which had been the first to apply for emergency authorization in the country.“After a thorough review of the currently available data, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of AstraZeneca ” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA and that the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Strategic vaccine AstraZeneca and Oxford’s vaccine is poised to become a dominant shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.The Philippine government, private sector, and several local governments had earlier entered intro tripartite deals with the drug maker to secure up to 17 million doses of the vaccine for Filipinos.(READ: PH vaccine stockpile from AstraZeneca reaches 17 million doses) Supplies were expected to arrive sometime in the second quarter of the year, though vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr earlier said that the government was negotiating for an earlier delivery “at the soonest possible time.” Unlike other vaccines the Philippines eyed to buy, AstraZeneca was among the few companies that have so far expressed willingness to enter into tripartite deals involving local governments and the private sector.Other companies said to be open to the setup are US drug makers Moderna and Novavax.Health experts earlier said that AstraZeneca’s vaccine would also be easier to distribute inpoorer and harder-to-reach areas, considering it can be transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months, making it compatible with the Department of Health’s (DOH) storage facilities.Early analysis of clinical trial results showed an average efficacy of about 70% after the first dose.The vaccine was seen to be 90% effective in participants who were given a half dose, followed by a full dose.This was compared to 62% efficacy seen in participants who were given two full doses.While the FDA granted AstraZeneca an EUA, it is not yet a full approval.",1.0,0.7904000282287598,"vaccination, duterte, expert, trial, get, approve, emergency_use, first, astrazeneca, pfizer","['approve', 'astrazeneca', 'emergency_use']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says the Philippines expects to receive about 5.1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and about 24.1 million doses in the second quarter
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said that the government is willing to pay more to secure earlier access to COVID-19 vaccines within the first half of the year.
Galvez made the statement during a televised meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday night, February 24, after setbacks in the delivery of initial doses delayed the start of the country’s inoculation campaign that was eyed to begin by February.""Iyong ongoing negotiation po natin sa mga ibang vaccine ay kailangan po na ina-ano po namin na kung puwede silang magkaroon ng early delivery. At nagne-negotiate din po tayo kahit mapamahal nang kaunti basta ma-early delivery lang po sila ng second quarter at saka po ng first quarter,"" Galvez said.
(In our ongoing negations for vaccines, we’re asking if it's possible to have an early delivery. We’re negotiating to have early delivery in the second and first quarter even if vaccines will be slightly more expensive.)
The retired general said that the Philippines expects to receive about 5.1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and about 24.1 million doses in the second quarter.He explained that the ""technique"" they're using is to try to get an earlier delivery of vaccines even at higher prices so that the increase in the prices could be ""offset earlier"" as well.
Galvez and other Philippine pandemic officials earlier targeted to start the country’s mass vaccination campaign by the end of February with doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine to be supplied under the COVAX global facility. But paperwork and the lack of an indemnification law in the country have stalled the delivery of vaccines to be used on priority sectors including health workers, senior citizens, and vulnerable populations.Aside from vaccines to be supplied by COVAX, the Philippines is in talks to directly purchase shots from Moderna, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), US firms Pfizer and BioNTech, British firm AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute.Galvez said officials are also trying to negotiate with the United Kingdom, China, India, and Russia to increase vaccines expected to be delivered to the Philippines in the first quarter.Under the current timeline of deliveries, the Philippines expects to receive the bulk of vaccines in the third to fourth quarter of 2021 for a “major” rollout.Galvez said the Philippines is supposed to receive 161 million doses by the end of 2021 to vaccinate 50 to 70 million adult Filipinos “in a best case scenario.” This number would be just enough to reach the recommended 60% to 70% of the population to reach herd immunity against COVID-19, based on scientists' estimates. – Rappler.com

PART 1: Rappler sifts through plans of officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country
In February, the Philippines will embark on its biggest mass immunization campaign yet, as it prepares to dole out coronavirus vaccines that could end the health emergency – but not without testing the country’s strained health system and pandemic response once more.To get a picture of the scale of the challenge, consider this: Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje said the largest vaccination campaign the government has ever conducted, so far, involved inoculating about 29 million Filipinos. Annual routine immunization programs aim to reach about two million children nationwide.
But targets for a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 eclipse these figures, as the campaign aims to cover from 50 million to 70 million Filipinos in 2021 alone. Its desired end stage has a much more ambitious goal: reaching all 110 million Filipinos spread across the archipelago by 2024.For the unprecedented task, the government has partnered with the private sector to facilitate requirements needed for storage, delivery, to actual distribution and tracking of vaccines.In Part 1 of this explainer, Rappler sifts through plans of key officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country. In part 2, we will detail the government's strategy for distributing vaccines from storage facilities to the public.
Which vaccines may arrive first?
In a best case scenario, doses of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine may be the first to arrive in the Philippines come February. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said this could happen through the Gavi COVAX facility which planned to supply doses to low-income countries for an early rollout.
Pfizer is, so far, the only company that has secured emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – a requirement necessary for any vaccine to be used on the public.
Aside from the Pfizer vaccine, Galvez said Sinovac and AstraZeneca's vaccines may be next to arrive in the country, considering that doses for the two vaccines were already secured in negotiations.
Both Sinovac and AstraZeneca still need to be cleared by the FDA. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the agency is waiting for Phase 3 trial data from Sinovac before it can move on to a full review, while AstraZeneca's EUA application is currently under evaluation.

How will vaccines be brought to the Philippines?
Galvez said delivery of vaccine supplies will be the responsibility of vaccine companies and manufacturers, based on current negotiations being finalized.Once vaccines arrive in the Philippines, officials will take up to 15 days to inspect the items, he said. At the House of Representatives and Senate, Galvez also asked lawmakers to pass legislation that would ensure the speedy release of doses from Customs, recalling similar past experiences where personal protective equipment couldn’t get to hospitals that needed them because of Customs requirements.Experts warned the rollout of vaccines could be severely delayed, and the quality of supplies compromised, if necessary measures were not taken to prevent the items from being held up in Customs. Where will vaccines be stored?
Health experts identified two strategies for storing vaccines, depending on their required temperature conditions.The first covers vaccines that need storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C and -20°C. For these, suppliers will transport doses to the Department of Health’s (DOH) rented private warehouse or the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM), which is the main storage location of vaccines used for the government’s National Immunization Program.
From here, vaccines will be transported to the DOH’s 17 centers for health development that serve as regional hubs.Citing their experience in storing vaccines for measles, polio, and other routine immunizations, the DOH earlier said there are enough storage facilities in the country for vaccines that need to be kept at 2°C to 8°C and -20°C. These include main sites in Metro Manila, regional centers, as well as provincial capitols.SCREENSHOT FROM DOH
What about vaccines needing ultralow temperature storage?
As for vaccines that will require -70°C or ultracold storage facilities, like those of Pfizer and BioNTech, distributors will transport doses to private warehouses of third party logistics providers tapped by the government.The DOH said final terms of agreements are still being discussed with companies with extensive experience in handling pharmaceutical products, including Zuellig Pharma Group, Royal Cargo, Orca, Maersk, LBC, and Metro Pacific, among others.This comes on top of the 10 ultralow freezers the government procured to store more vaccine doses requiring frigid temperatures, and 5 ultralow units available in RITM, that can store over 1.1 million doses.In an interview with Rappler, Zuellig chief business officer Jannette Jakosalem said the company has ordered 10 ultralow freezers that can each store about 400,000 to 500,000 vaccine doses. Zuellig Pharma – the biggest distributor of pharmaceutical goods in the Philippines – also has plans to purchase 4 more ultralow freezers for use in Cebu City and Davao City.
Partnerships with the logistical companies will be even more crucial in August, when the DOH will need assistance in storing vaccines needing storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C.Duque earlier said that the DOH expected vaccines for its regular immunization programs to arrive by then, and that it was crucial for these child vaccination programs to continue amid a COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

EXPLAINER: How COVID-19 vaccines will get from warehouses to you",Rappler,2021-01-19 15:42:00,"PART 1: Rappler sifts through plans of officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country In February, the Philippines will embark on its biggest mass immunization campaign yet, as it prepares to dole out coronavirus vaccines that could end the health emergency – but not without testing the country’s strained health system and pandemic response once more.To get a picture of the scale of the challenge, consider this: Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje said the largest vaccination campaign the government has ever conducted, so far, involved inoculating about 29 million Filipinos.Which vaccines may arrive first?Aside from the Pfizer vaccine, Galvez said Sinovac and AstraZeneca's vaccines may be next to arrive in the country, considering that doses for the two vaccines were already secured in negotiations.Galvez said delivery of vaccine supplies will be the responsibility of vaccine companies and manufacturers, based on current negotiations being finalized.Once vaccines arrive in the Philippines, officials will take up to 15 days to inspect the items, he said.From here, vaccines will be transported to the DOH’s 17 centers for health development that serve as regional hubs.Citing their experience in storing vaccines for measles, polio, and other routine immunizations, the DOH earlier said there are enough storage facilities in the country for vaccines that need to be kept at 2°C to 8°C and -20°C.As for vaccines that will require -70°C or ultracold storage facilities, like those of Pfizer and BioNTech, distributors will transport doses to private warehouses of third party logistics providers tapped by the government.The DOH said final terms of agreements are still being discussed with companies with extensive experience in handling pharmaceutical products, including Zuellig Pharma Group, Royal Cargo, Orca, Maersk, LBC, and Metro Pacific, among others.This comes on top of the 10 ultralow freezers the government procured to store more vaccine doses requiring frigid temperatures, and 5 ultralow units available in RITM, that can store over 1.1 million doses.In an interview with Rappler, Zuellig chief business officer Jannette Jakosalem said the company has ordered 10 ultralow freezers that can each store about 400,000 to 500,000 vaccine doses.Partnerships with the logistical companies will be even more crucial in August, when the DOH will need assistance in storing vaccines needing storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C.Duque earlier said that the DOH expected vaccines for its regular immunization programs to arrive by then, and that it was crucial for these child vaccination programs to continue amid a COVID-19 vaccine rollout.",5.0,0.7903000116348267,"city, worker, health, doh, get, trial, first, astrazeneca, sinovac, rollout","['explainer', 'expect', 'arrive']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says 'more or less' 7 manufacturers will supply the vaccine doses for an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Wednesday, January 6, that the government is targeting to secure at least 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the country in 2021.The supply of 148 million, if fully secured, could cover some 70 million Filipinos, assuming two doses are needed per person. National Task Force deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said the government wanted to vaccinate 50 to 70 million people within the year.
Galvez said the 148 million-figure was based on current negotiations with “more or less 7” vaccine companies that the government was in advanced talks with, including Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), Sinovac, and Gamaleya.“We hope to close a deal with these companies this month,” he said in a virtual press briefing.What's the timeline?
Galvez did not give specific dates on when vaccine doses from these companies may arrive in the Philippines.He earlier said he expected Sinovac's vaccine to arrive in the Philippines as early as March, but this would depend on whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the vaccine for emergency use. Sinovac has not yet applied for the necessary emergency use authorization (EUA) with the FDA.(READ: How FDA grants emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccines, meds)
So far, a solid purchase deal was signed with AstraZeneca, the government, and private sector in November 2020. This is for the purchase of some 3 million doses expected to arrive around the second quarter of 2021.Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, meanwhile, is applying for Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, while the FDA recently approved clinical trials for Janssen’s vaccine that could start later this month.Galvez also recently told President Rodrigo Duterte that the Serum Institute of India, which partnered with Novavax to produce its vaccine, promised to set aside 30 million doses for the Philippines.
As for Pfizer, no updates have been given after Galvez signed a confidentiality data agreement with the company in November 2020. Pfizer is the only vaccine company that has applied for an EUA with the FDA as of January 6. (READ: Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?)

Why it matters
Launching a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 is crucial in taming the pandemic as soon as possible, though the Philippines has been lagging behind in a global race to secure supplies of the coveted good.
A recent study published in the BMJ medical journal found that based on advance purchase commitments, high income countries already reserved over half of doses to be supplied from 13 leading manufacturers.“Even if all 13 of these vaccine manufacturers were to succeed in reaching their maximum production capacity, at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022,” the study said. – Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-01-06 14:45:00,"Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says 'more or less' 7 manufacturers will supply the vaccine doses for an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Wednesday, January 6, that the government is targeting to secure at least 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the country in 2021.The supply of 148 million, if fully secured, could cover some 70 million Filipinos, assuming two doses are needed per person.National Task Force deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said the government wanted to vaccinate 50 to 70 million people within the year.Galvez did not give specific dates on when vaccine doses from these companies may arrive in the Philippines.He earlier said he expected Sinovac's vaccine to arrive in the Philippines as early as March, but this would depend on whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the vaccine for emergency use.(READ: How FDA grants emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccines, meds) So far, a solid purchase deal was signed with AstraZeneca, the government, and private sector in November 2020.This is for the purchase of some 3 million doses expected to arrive around the second quarter of 2021.Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, meanwhile, is applying for Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, while the FDA recently approved clinical trials for Janssen’s vaccine that could start later this month.Galvez also recently told President Rodrigo Duterte that the Serum Institute of India, which partnered with Novavax to produce its vaccine, promised to set aside 30 million doses for the Philippines.Pfizer is the only vaccine company that has applied for an EUA with the FDA as of January 6.TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?",2.0,0.7896999716758728,"astrazeneca, pfizer, ph, deal, sign, receive, dose, duterte, trial, roque","['target', 'purchase', 'dose']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group is meeting to discuss how the initial 487,200 AstraZeneca doses will be distributed
The first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Philippines may be allocated for senior healthcare workers unable to receive Sinovac's CoronaVac, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Thursday, March 4.
Galvez said this strategy is being considered by members of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), who were meeting to discuss how the initial 487,200 doses will be distributed across the country.""Most likely – may mga doctor kasi na nagsasabi i-priority natin 'yung mga senior healthcare workers…. Our recommendation is for 'yung mga senior healthcare workers,"" Galvez said in an interview with CNN Philippines' Pinky Webb.(Most likely – we have doctors who are saying we should prioritize senior healthcare workers. Our recommendation is for the senior healthcare workers [to get the AstraZeneca vaccine].)
Galvez gave the update as the Philippines is scheduled to receive its first delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine supplied by the global COVAX Facility on Thursday night. The delivery was supposed to be last Monday, March 1, but was stalled by logistical problems and supply concerns.
The 487,200 doses arriving on Thursday are fewer than the 525,600 doses the Philippines had first expected to receive last Monday.
Galvez said the smaller delivery is due to logistical and packaging constraints as the AstraZeneca vaccine will be delivered to the Philippines through a commercial flight.
Why this matters
Health officials are hoping more health workers will be inclined to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, the only other option to be made available so far aside from Sinovac's vaccine donated by China to the Philippines.
Two days since the Philippines started rolling out Sinovac's vaccine, only some 8,559 health workers have been vaccinated. Enthusiasm for the vaccine was muted amid concerns over its lower efficacy for health workers exposed to COVID-19 and the robustness of its data compared to other vaccines.
But while a considerable number of health workers had turned down Sinovac's vaccine, opting to wait for AstraZeneca's shot, doses are still extremely limited for the priority group.

(UPDATED) This first shipment from the COVAX Facility, together with the earlier Sinovac doses, gives the country the ability to vaccinate over 540,000 individuals
Close to 500,000 doses of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University arrived in the Philippines aboard a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines commercial plane on Thursday night, March 4.
The shipment arrived around 7:20 pm at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Metro Manila.
The vaccines were picked up from Belgium and had a stopover in Bangkok, Thailand, before heading to NAIA in Metro Manila.
President Rodrigo Duterte welcomed the shipment in a ceremony at the Villamor Air Base that was delayed because he arrived two hours late, at around 9:30 pm.
From there, the vaccines were to be brought to a warehouse of logistics company Metropac Logistics in Marikina City.
Testament to collaboration
In his speech at the ceremony, Duterte thanked the COVAX Facility, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, WHO, and ambassadors who made the vaccine shipment possible.
Meanwhile, WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the arrival of the AstraZeneca shipment is a ""testament to the strength of collaboration, cooperation, and compassion.""
He also praised Duterte's ""strong leadership"" amid the pandemic.
According to the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the distribution of the vaccines throughout the country will ""immediately commence after repackaging.""
A total of 487,200 doses arrived, less than the 525,600 doses the government expected to receive last Monday, March 1.
The smaller delivery was due to logistical and packaging constraints that came with the commercial flight, according to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, known as AZD1222, is a viral vector vaccine that requires two doses and can be stored in normal refrigerator temperatures (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).
It is composed of an adenovirus derived from chimpanzees and modified to train the vaccine recipient's immune system to fight the virus that causes COVID-19.
First from COVAX Facility
The AstraZeneca shipment is the first shipment of vaccines from the COVAX Facility led by the World Health Organization, an initiative that ensures equitable access of COVID-19 jabs in developing countries.
The delivery came through after an expected shipment of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine – also secured through COVAX – did not arrive in mid-February as earlier promised by the government.
The Pfizer shots were supposed to have been the country's first COVID-19 vaccines.
The delay was due to the country's lack of an indemnification law, as well as disagreements over the scope of indemnity for Pfizer.
The Pfizer shots from COVAX are now expected to arrive in the 2nd quarter of 2021, or April at the earliest.
First shipments reserved for medical frontliners
The AstraZeneca doses, along with the first shipment of Sinovac vaccines, bring the Philippines' number of COVID-19 vaccine doses to 1,087,200.
This is good for only 543,600 individuals or 32% of the 1.7 million health workers deemed a priority of the vaccination program.
However, the Philippines is set to procure 1 million more doses of CoronaVac, the Sinovac vaccine, this month, according to Galvez. This would bring the number of doses to nearly 2.1 million or enough for 1,043,600 individuals.
The AstraZeneca doses are being eyed for elderly health workers since the Food and Drug Administration did not recommend CoronaVac for persons older than 59 years old.
However, this will still depend on the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 vaccines (NITAG), the government vaccine experts crafting recommendations on how approved vaccines are to be administered.
The NITAG held a meeting earlier on Thursday to formulate such guidelines for the AstraZeneca vaccines.
As of Wednesday evening, March 3, the Philippines has vaccinated 9,077 individuals, mostly health workers in Metro Manila.

The President again declares his vote of confidence for China and Russia vaccines, saying he prefers them to US vaccines
Stepping up his populist messaging during the pandemic, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said his goal is for his government to shoulder COVID-19 vaccination for each Filipino.
He declared this during a ""message to the people"" aired late Wednesday, October 14, after his meeting with coronavirus task force officials.
""I have the money already for the vaccine. But hahanap pa ako ng maraming pera (I will look for more money) because, you know, there are now 113 million Filipinos and to me, ideally, all should have the vaccine. Without exception, lahat (all),"" said Duterte. ([PODCAST] Duterte, Trump, Bolsonaro: The 'medical populists')
This departs from his previous speeches when he said wealthy Filipinos will not get such assistance from the government because they can ""buy their own vaccine.""
Duterte reiterated that priority will be given to the poorest Filipino households (specifically those listed as conditional cash transfer beneficiaries), soldiers, and police. The Chief Executive previously said he trusts only the military to distribute the vaccine when it becomes available.
Can the government afford it?
No economic manager was present at the Wednesday meeting. So far, we know that Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III targets a P20-billion fund for the purchase of a COVID-19 vaccine.
This fund will come from a loan to be provided by the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government financial institutions. The loan will be given to the Philippine International Trading Corp, which has been authorized to purchase vaccines for the government.
This fund is to shoulder only an ""initial"" batch of vaccines.
Apart from this, there's a P2.5-billion allocation for vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget.
Preference for China, Russia vaccines
Though Duterte never lacks in emphasizing his dire need for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, he indicated a preference for certain vaccines in his Wednesday speech.
""Para sa akin (For me), it's either China or Russia, okay na ako (I'm okay with that),"" he said.
""Wala akong – sinasabi nila Pfizer, Moderna, 'yung western, US. Okay rin 'yan kasi may proseso nga eh,"" Duterte continued. (I have nothing – they say Pfizer, Moderna, the western, US. They're also okay because there's a process.)
But he reserved a ringing vote of confidence for a Chinese or Russian vaccine, saying he'd be ""glad to open up [his] sleeves"" for an injection if China or Russia would just give him a call.
""Those of you who are asking if the Chinese vaccines are safe? I can say China is a modern country and it has all the wherewithals to make its country whose integrity is fully protected by its achievement,"" said Duterte.

As for Russia, the President said he had spoken to outgoing Russian Ambassador Igor Khovaev about plans to put up Russian pharmaceutical facilities in the Philippines.
The conversation took place during Khovaev's farewell call to Duterte at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse earlier that day.
Philippine vaccine experts are still studying documents sent over by Russia's Gamaleya Institute about the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of its vaccine, Sputnik V. The expert panel will decide whether or not to green-light Phase 3 clinical trials for the vaccine in the Philippines.
Duterte has declared he has so much confidence in the Russian vaccine that he is willing to be the first to get inoculated with it.
Though Duterte is partial to a China or Russia vaccine, the Philippines is also participating in the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility.
Through this initiative, the Philippines is assured a supply of some 20% of its vaccine needs, a supply that would likely include whatever vaccine is proven effective, whether or not from China or Russia.

According to one rumor circulating in the Philippines, the coronavirus vaccine will allow President Rodrigo Duterte to kill people at the push of a button.
Elsewhere in the country of 108 million, memories of a dengue vaccine that has been banned locally are putting people off the idea of immunization even before the campaign begins.
""Many kids got sick after receiving that vaccine,"" 62-year-old Crisanta Alipio said of the ill-fated vaccine against dengue, a mosquito-borne disease that can be deadly.
She said she was afraid of the novel coronavirus but even more afraid of vaccination.
The Philippines is due to start immunizations next month despite suffering Southeast Asia's second-worst outbreak of the coronavirus with more than half a million infections and over 10,000 deaths.
But officials acknowledge they have an uphill struggle to persuade many people to take it, on top of the logistical difficulties in reaching 2,000 inhabited islands with a precarious health system in the Southeast Asian archipelago.
""Messaging has to be very concrete and evidence-based to encourage people to receive the vaccines,"" health undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told Reuters.
""We are assuring Filipinos that whatever vaccines that will be brought in and provided will go through a stringent process of regulation.""
Dengvaxia scare
Confidence in vaccines was knocked by controversy over French company Sanofi's Dengvaxia.
Rolled out rapidly in 2016 to more than 800,000 children to protect them from dengue – it was banned after its maker said it could worsen the disease in people who had not previously been exposed to the infection.
That led to two congressional enquiries and more than 100 criminal cases that linked child deaths to the anti-dengue shot – though such links have never been proved.
Sanofi has repeatedly said Dengvaxia is safe and effective and the vaccine has been approved for use by the United States and European Union.
After that episode, the Philippines fell from one of the top 10 countries for confidence in vaccines to no higher than 70th place. The number of children who were fully vaccinated fell from 85% in 2010 to 69% in 2019.
To address the fears, health workers would hold town hall and online meetings and be given special training on how to answer questions, said Carlito Galvez, a former army general running the anti-COVID-19 campaign, told the Senate.
The aim is to inoculate 70 million adults this year.

In parts of the southern Philippines, the big fear is of a state-sponsored death campaign – not completely far-fetched in a country where Duterte's drug war has left nearly 6,000 thousand dead since he took office in 2016.

Top Duterte government officials and soldiers are among the first to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the Philippines
Ahead of hundreds of thousands of health workers across the Philippines, some Cabinet officials and soldiers have already been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, officials confirmed on Monday, December 28.
“I know some from the Cabinet and from the presidential security guards,” Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año said in an interview with dzMM.
Meanwhile, Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Cirilto Sobejana confirmed that soldiers have been inoculated in an interview with dwIZ on the same day, adding that he did not know which vaccine provider the immunizations came from.
Keeping it secret
Sobejana declined to name the unit where the soldiers belonged to, but Año identified the Presidential Security Group (PSG) – which is composed of soldiers, cops, coast guards, and civilian personnel – as a beneficiary of the early vaccination.The Armed Forces of the Philippines, in a statement on Monday afternoon, confirmed that the soldiers belonged to the PSG.
As for the Cabinet officials, Año declined to name them, citing their right to privacy. Año appeared to have one Cabinet official in mind when he was asked to reveal their identities.
“I cannot confirm it unless that person will say that he’s confirmed [to have had the vaccine]. Only he can give the confirmation,” Año said.
Was the process followed?
Año and Sobejana said the vaccination was necessary as the Cabinet officials and soldiers were considered frontliners. It is unclear if they followed the government’s own process for vaccine approval.
Under Duterte’s own order, only the Food and Drug Authority can issue emergency use authorizations (EUAs), which could cut the review period of 6 months down to 1 month only.Duterte signed the order on December 2.

President Rodrigo Duterte defends Chinese-made vaccines, claiming they are every bit as reliable as Western ones
The Philippines has signed an agreement for 25 million doses of CoronaVac, the coronavirus vaccine of Chinese firm Sinovac.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr confirmed this in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 13.
""They gave a commitment, and I signed the term sheet and had a copy of the signed term sheet for 25 million [doses] sent to Hong Kong,"" he said in Filipino.
An initial batch of 50,000 doses is expected to arrive in the country on February 20, to be followed by 950,000 more doses in March.
Galvez praised Sinovac for being the ""only"" vaccine maker to give definite monthly delivery dates for its doses.
Why this matters
The signing of the term sheet adds to the Philippines' list of agreements, locking in millions of the sought-after jabs for Filipinos.
Previously signed were deals for 30 million doses of the vaccine of US firm Novavax and 15 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through tripartite agreements with local governments and private corporations.
However, the Food and Drug Administration is yet to approve any vaccine for emergency use. Of the 3 vaccines secured through signed deals, only AstraZeneca has applied for emergency use approval as of writing.

In the same meeting, Duterte defended Chinese-made vaccines, claiming they are every bit as reliable as Western ones.

The Sinovac vaccine, however, has raised eyebrows for producing very different efficacy rates across various clinical trial sites.
In Brazil, where Sinovac's biggest clinical trial is being conducted, the vaccine was initially said to be 78% effective in preventing mild cases of COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing severe infections. But new data showed that the overall efficacy rate is 50.38%.

(UPDATED) Here’s what you need to know about the process of approving clinical trials, when a COVID-19 vaccine might be rolled out, and who might receive it first
Over 9 months into the pandemic, scientists around the world continue to develop a viable COVID-19 vaccine as countries fight the spread of the new virus that has infected millions.
Here in the Philippines, a panel of vaccine experts under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has been reviewing a roster of potential vaccines with the interest of conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the country.

Searching for a coronavirus vaccine: What PH clinical trials will look like
Filipino diplomats abroad have also been in talks with vaccine developers and manufacturers to make sure the Philippines has access to an effective vaccine once it becomes available. Among these are vaccines being developed in the US and China.
But these efforts are only half the challenge in ensuring Filipinos are able to receive a COVID-19 vaccine once it is ready for mass use.
While clinical trials and discussions take place with vaccine developers, any potential vaccine will still need to go through regulatory processes in the Philippines before studies here can begin, or the use of vaccines can be allowed.That includes vaccines President Rodrigo Duterte has shown a preference for – like Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine and those being developed by research and pharmaceutical firms in China or the United States’ Moderna.On Wednesday, December 2, Duterte issued an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization for vaccines. This makes granting the necessary FDA approval for vaccines quicker as it can be issued 21 days after a government agency or company asks it to evaluate a particular vaccine.
Here’s what you need to know about how the Philippines will approve trials, how they will be regulated, and when a COVID-19 vaccine might be rolled out to the public.What's a clinical trial?
Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect humans’ health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.Trials need to be carefully designed, reviewed, and approved before they can start. Like most clinical trials, tests for a COVID-19 vaccine consist of 3 phases to determine its safety and efficacy.In the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the body tasked with regulating clinical trials.Why regulate trials?
Clinical trials deal with humans as subjects. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said this means that in any study, “the primary concern is always their human rights and safety.”By regulating trials, there is oversight in the way these are crafted, ensuring that trials meet good clinical practice standards and are able to ethically conduct tests involving humans.What might this look like? Domingo said participants should be able to understand fully what trial they are volunteering to join, as well as its benefits and risks. Volunteers should also know what safeguards will be afforded them, like close monitoring, checkups, and health insurance. Participants should also be free to leave the study.In regulating trials, the FDA will also form its own panel of experts to review adverse events that could occur during trials. This will be apart from the clinical trial expert team and safety monitoring committee part of the DOST.
Aside from this, clinical trials are regulated to ensue the integrity of data collected, which will be used to determine whether or not a treatment is ultimately safe and effective. This is especially true in the case of vaccines, which require extreme safety since they are designed to be given to millions of healthy people.
Who can conduct trials?
Only establishments with an FDA-issued license to operate as a clinical trial sponsor or contract research organization can conduct trials in the Philippines. This ensures that the group carrying out the research is legitimate and has the capacity to conduct such studies.In the case of Phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, interested groups will also need to secure the endorsement of the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel (VEP) and ethics review board.The added step in securing approval from the country’s VEP and ethics board is unique to COVID-19 vaccine trials, Domingo said, because the global search for a vaccine has become much more accelerated due to the pandemic.In this case, the VEP reviews data from Phase 1 and 2 trials of vaccine development companies that intend to conduct Phase 3 trials in the country. Meanwhile, the ethics board ensures that prospective trials will be carried out in such a way that the rights and health of volunteers are protected.What vaccine companies are interested in trials?

TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Domingo said it may take at least 21 days for FDA regulatory reviewers to evaluate and process applications of companies seeking to do trials. This includes 14 days for initial evaluation and a period of 7 days for applicants to respond to any clarifications.After this, the FDA is expected to issue a decision on applications in not more than 8 days after it receives the recommendation of regulatory reviewers.Vaccine experts earlier eyed to have Phase 3 trials start by October, though this has been moved to November 2020.
After trials, what happens next?
Once clinical trials are successfully completed and a vaccine is demonstrated to be safe and effective for humans, companies can apply for a certificate of product registration. The FDA is again in charge of evaluating and approving these.Conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines is not a prerequisite for a vaccine to be registered for use in the country.In evaluating a vaccine or any type of medicine, the FDA reviews its scientific data and can also consult with other similar regulatory bodies in other countries to compare findings.Apart from this, the Philippines is also a participant in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization COVAX facility designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.

When will a vaccine be available – and who will receive it first?
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr has said the soonest a vaccine may arrive in the Philippines would be sometime between May to June in 2021 at best, though a more “realistic” timeline was late 2021 to early 2022.While many candidate vaccines are still in their development phase, manufacturers have also begun the work of preparing for production and distribution.
In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) is in the planning phase of how to handle the complex procurement, storage, and distribution of vaccines once they are available.In administering the vaccines to Filipinos, the DOH has experience in carrying out mass vaccination programs through similar campaigns done in the past for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and polio.Duterte earlier said he wanted the entire Filipino population inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine “without exception,” adding that his goal was for the government to shoulder the costs for the country’s 113 million population.This remains unlikely for now. In reality, the DOH said it lacked P10 billion of the P12.1 billion needed to vaccinate an initial priority population of 20 million Filipinos.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez earlier said the country aims to source P73.2 billion ($1.5 billion) to pay for the COVID-19 vaccinations of 60 million Filipinos.Funds will be taken from loans from multilateral agencies like the Asian Development Bank and World Bank; domestic sources like LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines, and government corporations, and bilateral sources from countries where a vaccine is being developed.
As for who may receive the vaccine from the government first, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III gave an overview of groups to be prioritized. These include the following:Health care workers (including those in public and private hospitals, barangay health stations, COVID-19 treatment and rehabilitation centers)
Government frontline workers (including those in the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Education, Bureau of Corrections, Bureau of Fire Protection, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology)

(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision paves the way for the Pfizer vaccine to be given to Filipinos, but actual delivery remains uncertain as the government has yet to finalize a supply deal with the company
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for its use in a country hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia.
The historic approval – a first of its kind in the Philippines – was issued on Thursday, January 14, marking a milestone in the country’s fight against the disease which has so far infected over 492,000 people and killed nearly 10,000.""The FDA today is granting an emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine. It is decided that all conditions for an EUA are present and that the benefit of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risks,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA. In particular, evidence from well known and controlled trials showed that “it is reasonable to believe” that the vaccine may be effective to “prevent, diagnose, or treat COVID-19.”
Aside from this, the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Why it matters
In a best case scenario, the FDA decision would mean that the Pfizer vaccine can be distributed to Filipinos in a matter of weeks, with health and pandemic officials targeting an initial rollout by the end of February.In reality, the timeline of the vaccine administration and the actual number of doses that will arrive remain uncertain as the government has yet to finalize a supply deal with Pfizer. (READ: Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?)
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said the company committed to deliver 25 to 40 million doses to the Philippines if there was excess supply from the United Stares and other countries which had secured orders earlier.
For now, the identified February rollout will greatly depend on whether or not the country is included in the GAVI COVAX facility’s list of states that may get doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for an early rollout pegged for the coming month.Galvez said the government would submit an appeal to COVAX by January 15 to have the Philippines included among countries that will be given a share of doses. Between January 19 to 29, officials from the COVAX facility are also scheduled to inspect ultracold chain storage facilities necessary to keep Pfizer’s vaccine stable, as part of its assessment on whether the country was ready to receive it.Aside from demonstrating 95% efficacy, Pfizer's vaccine offers a boost of hope in taming the pandemic as preliminary studies showed it would likely remain effective against mutations of COVID-19.
The FDA’s decision comes 22 days after Pfizer officials filed an EUA application with the agency. Pfizer was the first to apply for emergency use in the Philippines, followed by British drug maker AstraZeneca.Worth noting
Once the first batch of the Pfizer vaccine arrives in the country, Galvez said it can only be distributed in Metro Manila, Cebu City, and Davao City, as these areas have the facilities to keep the vaccine at a temperature of -70°C (- 94 degrees Fahrenheit).The actual distribution would also be complicated. Health experts have cited the necessary preparation to handle the new vaccine when administering it to patients.
Pfizer officials earlier explained that while doses may last up to 6 months in ultra-low temperature freezers, they can be stored up to 30 days in thermal shippers the company designed, and up to 5 days in normal refrigerated 2-8°C conditions – posing a challenge for the Philippines’ health system.Frontline health workers in areas reporting high incidence of cases are among those prioritized to receive initial doses of the vaccine.

Malacañang makes the announcement on President Duterte's preferred vaccine ahead of the Food and Drug Administration
Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical firm, has applied for Emergency Use Authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine, Malacañang said on Monday, March 1.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque made the announcement ahead of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the government agency that receives EUA applications and is in charge of processing them.
Initially, Roque had said that Sinopharm planned to submit an EUA ""within the day."" But in a matter of minutes, after checking messages on his mobile phone, the Duterte spokesman issued a new announcement.
""I stand corrected. It has been filed. They have already filed with the FDA an application for EUA for Sinopharm vaccine,"" he said from the Philippine General Hospital, where vaccinations of healthcare workers were underway using another Chinese vaccine, Sinovac's CoronaVac.
Yet FDA Director General Eric Domingo has said he is yet to see Sinopharm's EUA application. As of writing, the FDA itself is yet to confirm the Malacañang announcement.
Duterte's preferred vaccine
The Sinopharm vaccine is Duterte's preferred anti-COVID-19 jab, as announced previously by Malacañang.
Roque had even said Malacañang lawyers were studying if the compassionate special permit allowing Duterte's security aides, the Presidential Security Group, to use 10,000 Sinopharm vaccine shots could provide legal basis for the Chief Executive to get those shots as well.
As of Monday, Malacañang's legal staff have yet to make a decision on the matter, said Roque.
The Sinopharm vaccine is at the heart of a controversy on smuggled vaccines.
Former special envoy Ramon Tulfo Jr, some PSG personnel, a senator, Cabinet member, and other high-ranking government officials were able to get Sinopharm vaccines in violation of regulatory processes and ahead of healthcare workers.
Despite this, Malacañang and Duterte himself have not moved to hold these individuals accountable. The President even instructed PSG members not to cooperate in any investigations.
Critics have said the Palace's hands-off stance smacks of preferential treatment and disdain for processes and regulations other Filipinos must follow. (READ: Malacañang after Mon Tulfo illegal vaccination: He can do as he pleases)
Roque, on Monday, even said the PSG's illegal vaccinations in 2020 could be covered by the FDA special permit for 10,000 new Sinopharm vaccines, thus absolving the PSG of liability.
""In law, there could be instances when we ratify acts earlier done because of subsequent acts. But my initial legal opion is it could have the affect of ratifying something earlier,"" said the Duterte spokesman.

Over a year since its first reported coronavirus case, the Philippines on Monday, March 1, will finally start rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, offering hope for a country among the hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia.The start of the Philippines’ vaccination campaign sets off an unprecedented effort to tame the global menace by inoculating at least 50 million people against a disease that has killed over 12,300 and made over 576,000 sick.But long-anticipated vaccinations face multiple uncertainties ahead as vaccine supplies and deliveries to the country remain erratic, and as experts warn of an uptick in cases amid the spread of a variant from the United Kingdom and discovery of a “mutation of concern” in Cebu City.Unknown curveballs
While the Philippines is launching its vaccine drive with 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac – a donation from the Chinese government, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III announced 525,600 AstraZeneca vaccine doses earlier scheduled to arrive on Monday will be delayed for ""about a week,” owing to a “global supply problem.’The delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines was welcome news after an initial batch of 117,000 Pfizer doses expected to arrive in the country in mid-February was stalled due to undone paperwork for an indemnification fund.
Aside from this, the timeline of the delivery of other COVID-19 vaccines eyed by the Duterte government, including those developed by Moderna, the Gamaleya Research Institute, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax remain unknown as the Philippines has not yet been able to sign supply deals pinning down a date for arrival.This comes as experts just last Saturday, February 27, warned of a “serious increase” in cases in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the country’s pandemic, and recent upticks in cases across several provinces in past weeks.In its latest report, the Octa Research Group on Saturday, February 27, said that the reproduction number (R) – the number of people that one COVID-19 positive case can infect – in the capital region climbed to 1.43 after managing to remain below 1 earlier in the month.""This is similar to the rate of increase observed in Cebu City, Mountain Province, and Benguet, where specimens of the SARS-CoV-2 variant were identified based on genome sequencing,"" it added.The increase in infections and the virus’ reproduction number pose a threat to vaccinations as experts warned rising cases would mean more Filipinos will need to be vaccinated against the disease faster.Vaccine hesitancy rising
Adding to hurdles, the arrival of vaccines comes as vaccine hesitancy increases across the Philippines, with about only 19% of Filipinos saying in a recent survey that they would be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Dr Gerardo Legaspi, director of the Philippine General Hospital, is the first person to legally receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines
After weeks of delay, the Philippines finally started its COVID-19 vaccination drive, among the last to do so in Southeast Asia.
Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Gerardo ""Dr Gap"" Legaspi was the first to roll up his sleeves as he received his shot of CoronaVac developed by Chinese company Sinovac.
Legaspi is also the first health worker in the country who received a legal COVID-19 vaccine following the unauthorized vaccination of several high-ranking government officials and close-in security personnel of President Rodrigo Duterte.
PGH nurse Chareluck Santos administered the vaccine shot to Legaspi.
Here's what we know about Legaspi:
Legaspi has been into active practice and teaching in neurosurgery for 25 years now.
In the Philippines, he pioneered awake craniotomy surgery, a brain surgery performed on patients who are awake.
His expertise includes treating aneurysms, arteriovenous malformation,brain tumors, congenital malformations of the brain and spinal cord, and skull base surgery.
He is the former president of the the ASEAN Neurosurgical Society and the Academy of Filipino Neurosurgeons Inc.
He has clinics in PGH, St Luke's Medical Center, and the Medical City.
He also works as a consultant in other government institutions as well, like Philippine Children's Medical Center, AFP Medical Center and Davao Regional Hospital in Tagum, Davao del Norte.
After Legaspi received the shot, Filipina actress Saab Magalona recalled how the doctor saved the life of her son after performing two brain surgeries.
Aside from Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo and health department adviser Dr Edsel Salvaña also received their first shot of the Sinovac vaccine.
The kickoff of the mass vaccination drive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, comes as health workers express reluctance to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
Domingo earlier said that CoronaVac's lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
FDA instead recommended its use to people aged 18 to 59 after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
The recommendation spurred days-long deliberations among experts belonging to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, who later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, reiterating it is safe and effective. – Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-03-01 13:04:00,"Dr Gerardo Legaspi, director of the Philippine General Hospital, is the first person to legally receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines After weeks of delay, the Philippines finally started its COVID-19 vaccination drive, among the last to do so in Southeast Asia.Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Gerardo ""Dr Gap"" Legaspi was the first to roll up his sleeves as he received his shot of CoronaVac developed by Chinese company Sinovac.Legaspi is also the first health worker in the country who received a legal COVID-19 vaccine following the unauthorized vaccination of several high-ranking government officials and close-in security personnel of President Rodrigo Duterte.Here's what we know about Legaspi: Legaspi has been into active practice and teaching in neurosurgery for 25 years now.In the Philippines, he pioneered awake craniotomy surgery, a brain surgery performed on patients who are awake.Domingo earlier said that CoronaVac's lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector.The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.",4.0,0.880299985408783,"vaccination, ph, get, galvez, duterte, first, dose, sinovac, health, supply","['meet', 'dr', 'gap', 'recipient', 'first', 'legal']",0.128,0.0,0.769,0.231,0.26666666666666666,Positive

The Philippines' richest families move to get COVID-19 vaccines for the country, once available. Will the private sector do the heavy lifting once again?
The Philippines' richest families are chipping in to ensure the availability of around one to two million COVID-19 vaccines widely expected to hit markets by mid-2021.
National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer Carlito Galvez Jr thanked Enrique Razon Jr, Lucio Tan, Ramon Ang, the Sy siblings, and Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion for placing orders for over one million vaccines through advance market commitments (AMCs) – a financing mechanism that basically assures funders of the vaccine once produced.
""Nagpapasalamat po tayo kay Enrique Razon na mayroon po rin siyang binigay na 300,000 doses. Ang BDO at saka po 'yung ibang mga Lucio Tan Group at saka San Miguel Corporation saka Go Negosyo, nakapag-raise na po sila ng more than one million. And hopefully, baka tataas pa 'yon ng one or two million doses,"" Galvez said in a briefing at Malacañang on Tuesday, November 17.
(We thank Enrique Razon, he will give 300,000 doses. BDO, the Lucio Tan Group, and San Miguel Corporation, and Go Negosyo as well, they were able to raise over one million [vaccines] and hopefully raise one to two million more doses.)
Galvez noted that the tycoons are set to donate 50% to 80% of what they are set to procure, while the rest will be given to their essential workers at no cost.
The private sector has played a big role in the Philippines' pandemic response. From donations of various goods, to testing employees and poor households, conglomerates have stepped in, as the government has drawn flak for how it is handling the crisis.
Private sector
Galvez's latest statements point to the private sector doing some heavy lifting once more – this time, in vaccinating the country's entire population of around 108 million, as President Rodrigo Duterte's economic team allotted a meager amount for the much-needed vaccine.
The proposed 2021 budget contains only P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement, with several lawmakers expressing dismay over the allocation.
The Department of Health (DOH) has estimated that it needs around P12.9 billion to meet the target of vaccinating at least 20% of the entire population for free. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)
The DOH earlier explained that the proposed budget was crafted before Duterte's directive to vaccinate the entire population, which is why only P2.5 billion was allocated for the COVID-19 vaccine.
Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III is targeting a P20-billion fund for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccine through a loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines.
Galvez likewise urged Duterte to enter into deals with the private sector for vaccine financing and procurement.
""We have also various modes of financing including private-public tripartite agreement without the cost [to] the government,"" Galvez said.
""So the private sector will finance it by buying directly [from] the vaccine company…with the regulation [by] the DOH…who will decide where the vaccine will be given.""
In the same briefing, Galvez recommended that the government enter into an AMC, with the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank to act as finance managers.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier recommended the creation of an executive order, which would allow the Food and Drug Administration to issue emergency use authorization to hasten procurement.
The Philippines is currently looking at 17 possible sources of vaccines from various countries.
Out of the 17, 9 are currently undergoing the 3rd phase of trials, with Pfizer and Moderna reporting promising results.

‘We have been developing our own vaccine for the past 3 months,’ says Indonesian President Joko Widodo
No, they’re not just waiting for vaccines from China or Russia.
Unlike the Philippines, Indonesia is developing its own coronavirus vaccine, which the country expects to complete by mid-2021.
“We have been developing our own vaccine for the past 3 months, specifically from the COVID-19 virus strain spread in Indonesia. Hopefully the vaccine will be ready soon and it (vaccine development) is expected to be completed by mid-2021,” said Indonesian President Joko Widodo, as quoted by the Jakarta Post on Tuesday, August 11.
Jokowi was speaking at the launch of the vaccine’s late-stage human trials, the Jakarta Post said. The vaccine is being developed by the Indonesian state-owned enterprise Bio Farma in partnership with Sinovac Biotech of China.
“We are proud that a state-owned enterprise like Bio Farma in partnership with Sinovac Biotech of China are able to begin phase III clinical trials. Not many countries or institutions have been able to reach this stage,” said Indonesia’s State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir.
This is part of Indonesia’s long-term strategy to fight COVID-19, knowing it might be difficult to gain access to other countries’ vaccines.“Therefore, it is necessary for Indonesia to develop its own COVID-19 vaccine. And it will be by Indonesia, from Indonesia, to Indonesia,” said Ali Ghufron Mukti of Indonesia’s research and technology ministry, in another Jakarta Post report.
In contrast, the Philippines, which has invested little in scientific research through the years, concedes it has no means to produce its own vaccine. Instead it is banking on a short-term strategy of joining clinical trials of other countries – a move Indonesia is also taking.

Searching for a coronavirus vaccine: What PH clinical trials will look like
Even as vaccines are being developed in many other parts of the globe, President Rodrigo Duterte said he prefers to wait for vaccines from China and Russia.

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III says the fund will be enough to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos. Is this enough to attain herd immunity?
The Philippines aims to come up with P73.2 billion ($1.5 billion) to pay for the COVID-19 vaccinations of 60 million Filipinos, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, November 23.
""P73.2 billion financing that's pretty much – most of it is already fixed,"" he told Duterte and other Cabinet members who met in Davao City to discuss measures against the pandemic and other issues.
Dominguez spelled out the sources of this fund.
""Low cost, long-term"" loans from multilateral agencies like Asian Development Bank and World Bank - P40 billion
Domestic sources like LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines, and government corporations - P20 billion
Bilateral sources from countries where a vaccine is being developed - P13.2 billion
The finance chief, however, tempered expectations, saying the P13.2 billion funds estimated to come from bilateral arrangements is ""not completely negotiated.""
$25 to vaccinate one Filipino
Dominguez estimated that it would cost an average of $25 or P1,200 to vaccinate one Filipino.
This would mean that with a P73.2 billion budget, the government will be able to pay for the vaccination of 60 million Filipinos or slightly less than 60% of the country's population.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III backed up Dominguez, saying this number of inoculated Filipinos is enough to achieve herd immunity, or the resistance of a community to a disease due to immunity of a high-proportion of its people.
""Herd immunity, Mr President, is anywhere from 60% to 70%, according to the World Health Organization. If we’re able to reach that, we’re going to pretty much arrest the spread of this and mawawala yung COVID-19 sa ating lipunan (and COVID-19 will disappear from our society),"" said Duque.
""So basically, 60 million [people] is okay and we have funds for that,"" said Dominguez in response.
Studies on vaccines say that the percentage of a population required to achieve herd immunity will largely depend on how effective the vaccine is.
In the same meeting, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said his strategy for distributing the vaccine would be to prioritize doses for coronavirus ""hotspots"" like Metro Manila, Davao City, Bacolod City, and others.
Then the vulnerable sectors in these cities or provinces would be given the vaccines first – poor households, health workers, military and police.
The proposed 2021 budget contains only P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement, disappointing several lawmakers.
The Department of Health has estimated that it needs around P12.9 billion to meet the target of vaccinating at least 20% of the entire population for free. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)
Status of vaccine negotiations
The government is already negotiating with 4 vaccine developers – Pfizer (US), AstraZeneca (United Kingdom), Sinovac (China), and Janssen (US), said Galvez.
By the end of November, the government will be able to provide its Advance Market Commitment to these firms to reserve a supply of their vaccine, he added.
Galvez was most optimistic about the arrangements for the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying the firm is setting aside 20 million doses for the Philippines and that it is the most affordable, costing ""more or less $5.""

Until the ceremonial rollout of the country's first vaccines from Sinovac, health workers express reluctance to receive the shot, opting to wait for different vaccines to become available
After nearly 580,000 infections, over 12,300 lives lost, and a year into quarantine restrictions, the Philippines finally launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on Monday, March 1.The historic day, long anticipated by millions as the world receded into lockdown, marked a turning point in the Philippines’ fight against the pandemic.
Government officials who witnessed the arrival of 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines celebrated these as the first “doses of hope” – the moment bringing leaders close to tears, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said.But for most of the country, the delivery of the first COVID-19 vaccines was met with a mix of anxiety, anger, and a lack of enthusiasm as the public had been made to expect the arrival of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines perceived to be better options.At the Philippine General Hospital, where the President’s pandemic representatives gathered for a ceremonial vaccination on Monday, officials spent considerable time convincing health workers to receive the vaccine.“Huwag nating hintayin 'yung tinatawag na (Let’s not wait for the so-called) best vaccine. There is no such 'best vaccine' because the best vaccine is the one that is safe and efficient, and arrives earlier,” Galvez said.Manila Mayor Isko Moreno echoed the appeal, calling available vaccines an “answered prayer.”“Let me address those who are waiting – I will respect you, your beliefs, and your views but kung ako ay tatanungin ninyo…hinihikayat ko kayo, 'wag ninyo ipagpabukas, 'wag ninyo ipagbakasakali ang kaligtasan ninyo,” he said.(Let me address those who are waiting – I will respect you, your beliefs, and your views, but if you ask me, I’m urging you, don’t put off until tomorrow or leave your safety to chance.)Moreno added: “Remember, if not all of you, most of us, most of you prayed last year to have a vaccine. In God’s mercy, he heard us. I think doctors and scientists here will agree that to develop a vaccine takes so many years but God has so many ways to hear us and I think now it’s up to us to act.”MUST READ

Health workers' hurt
Until the day of the ceremonial rollout, health workers from hospitals taking part in the distribution opposed the injection of Sinovac on them, citing its lower efficacy of 50.4% from Phase 3 trials among health frontliners in Brazil.Hospital workers from the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) staged a protest during their lunch break expressing “exasperation” at the Duterte government’s “consistently inconsistent” pronouncements on the mass vaccination program.Health workers criticized the government for passing on the burden of encouraging public trust in vaccination, saying it was the government’s responsibility to provide the best vaccines and be transparent.
The vaccinations on March 1 were the first legal vaccinations in the country, following the inoculation of several officials and government workers with smuggled vaccines in 2020.“Many from our ranks have been infected and some died combating the deadly virus. Our health and lives are always at stake, it is just right and humane that we demand the free, safest, and most efficacious vaccine,” said Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the LCP employees association-Alliance of Health Workers.At PGH, workers also called on the government to deliver the “best” vaccine to health workers. The hospital, among the few COVID-19 designated centers, reported a marked drop in willingness of its employees to get vaccinated days before the start of the rollout.PGH Director Gerardo Legaspi said that over 90% of the hospitals’ workforce had earlier said they were willing to get vaccinated, following the government’s announcement that health workers would receive Pfizer’s vaccine first.
The figure dropped to some 13% after officials said Sinovac would be offered instead, since paperwork on indemnity requirements stalled the delivery of Pfizer doses.Just days before the scheduled rollout, the PGH Physicians Association (PA) decried in a statement the PGH administration for not consulting them, when administrators said the hospital was ready to take “whatever vaccine becomes available.”VACCINATION STARTS.

The physicians urged leaders to wait for the assessment of the country’s Health Technology Assessment Council which reviews the “ethical, legal, social and health system implications” of medical technologies like vaccines, saying this would aid each worker to make a better-informed decision on whether or not to receive Sinovac’s CoronaVac.“The PGH PA stands firm that Sinovac, despite being the only vaccine available at hand should undergo appraisal by the HTAC…. PGH should uphold the ideals of ethical and evidence-based medicine, for which it is a bastion of,” the group said.More reluctance
Meanwhile, at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, health workers were likewise reluctant to receive the Sinovac vaccine, preferring to wait for other vaccines to arrive.
Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, who received the Sinovac vaccine, only appealed to health workers to get themselves vaccinated.The FDA earlier granted Sinovac emergency authorization, but its experts did not recommend it for health workers exposed to COVID-19 since lower efficacy from trials in Brazil had led experts there to not recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
Experts belonging to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, emphasizing that it is safe and effective. With doses limited and deliveries uncertain, health workers should be given the option to choose whether or not to get the Sinovac vaccine, they said.
“Consider yourselves and your personal situation and if you are ready, give your informed consent that you are willing to get vaccinated. Just don’t decide to not get vaccinated,” Domingo said in Filipino.MUST READ

Vaccinations a priority
The decision of health workers to receive a vaccine is made more difficult by the uncertainty of when succeeding vaccines will arrive. At least 525,600 AstraZeneca doses were expected on Monday, but this was delayed by about “a week,” owing to limited global supply.Despite government's vaccine campaign and promises that more shots would be available, there is no guarantee when this would happen.Galvez was scheduled to travel to India from March 9 to 12 to sign the Duterte government’s first supply agreements that would pin down a specific date for the delivery of AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines. Amid the muted response to the Sinovac vaccine, experts who anticipate a surge of new cases in Metro Manila in the coming weeks, said health workers should get vaccinated while the surge is still in its early stages.“Our healthcare workers in the region must seize this opportunity,” Octa Research said.The issue is further compounded by rising vaccine hesitancy, with a recent survey showing some 46% of Filipinos are still unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Former health secretary Manuel Dayrit said in an interview with CNN Philippines that his main concern is how fast vaccinations could continue. He pointed out that 500,000 Filipinos would need to be vaccinated daily to achieve government targets.
The more vaccines are delayed, the more impact this could have on health, rising hunger, and unemployment. While the Philippines was among countries hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia, it was the last in the region to receive COVID-19 vaccines after starting talks with vaccine firms only sometime in November 2020.
Delayed negotiations have narrowed down options for vaccines to be purchased as supplies fluctuate and remain scarce. Until then, Filipinos have no choice but to wait as officials continue to urge people to get themselves vaccinated. – Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-03-02 09:25:00,"Government officials who witnessed the arrival of 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines celebrated these as the first “doses of hope” – the moment bringing leaders close to tears, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said.But for most of the country, the delivery of the first COVID-19 vaccines was met with a mix of anxiety, anger, and a lack of enthusiasm as the public had been made to expect the arrival of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines perceived to be better options.At the Philippine General Hospital, where the President’s pandemic representatives gathered for a ceremonial vaccination on Monday, officials spent considerable time convincing health workers to receive the vaccine.“Huwag nating hintayin 'yung tinatawag na (Let’s not wait for the so-called) best vaccine.I think doctors and scientists here will agree that to develop a vaccine takes so many years but God has so many ways to hear us and I think now it’s up to us to act.”MUST READ Philippines begins legally rolling out first COVID-19 vaccines Health workers' hurt Until the day of the ceremonial rollout, health workers from hospitals taking part in the distribution opposed the injection of Sinovac on them, citing its lower efficacy of 50.4% from Phase 3 trials among health frontliners in Brazil.Hospital workers from the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) staged a protest during their lunch break expressing “exasperation” at the Duterte government’s “consistently inconsistent” pronouncements on the mass vaccination program.Health workers criticized the government for passing on the burden of encouraging public trust in vaccination, saying it was the government’s responsibility to provide the best vaccines and be transparent.The hospital, among the few COVID-19 designated centers, reported a marked drop in willingness of its employees to get vaccinated days before the start of the rollout.PGH Director Gerardo Legaspi said that over 90% of the hospitals’ workforce had earlier said they were willing to get vaccinated, following the government’s announcement that health workers would receive Pfizer’s vaccine first.Health workers at the Lung Center of the Philippines on Monday, March 1, 2021.The physicians urged leaders to wait for the assessment of the country’s Health Technology Assessment Council which reviews the “ethical, legal, social and health system implications” of medical technologies like vaccines, saying this would aid each worker to make a better-informed decision on whether or not to receive Sinovac’s CoronaVac.“The PGH PA stands firm that Sinovac, despite being the only vaccine available at hand should undergo appraisal by the HTAC….Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, who received the Sinovac vaccine, only appealed to health workers to get themselves vaccinated.The FDA earlier granted Sinovac emergency authorization, but its experts did not recommend it for health workers exposed to COVID-19 since lower efficacy from trials in Brazil had led experts there to not recommend its use in the priority sector.At least 525,600 AstraZeneca doses were expected on Monday, but this was delayed by about “a week,” owing to limited global supply.Despite government's vaccine campaign and promises that more shots would be available, there is no guarantee when this would happen.Galvez was scheduled to travel to India from March 9 to 12 to sign the Duterte government’s first supply agreements that would pin down a specific date for the delivery of AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines.",0.0,0.832099974155426,"get, ph, moderna, case, china, sinovac, filipino, duterte, dose, willing","['arrive', 'filipino', 'willing', 'get']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.75,Neutral

The Department of Health assures the public that Russia's COVID-19 vaccine will be subject to a rigorous review and regulatory protocols before possible use in the Philippines
Philippine officials are eyeing to participate in Phase 3 clinical trials for Russia's COVID-19 vaccine.
The vaccine was touted by Russian President Vladimir Putin as ""quite effective,"" but scientists worldwide have raised concerns over its safety.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Wednesday, August 12, that the Philippines' vaccine expert panel led by the Department of Science and Technology would meet with the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology within the day.
Gamaleya, part of Russia's health ministry, had developed the vaccine in coordination with the country's defense ministry.
""Ang pag-uusapan ngayon (What will be discussed) with the Department of Science and Technology is how we can possibly have the clinical trial here also in the Philippines,"" Vergeire told reporters in a briefing.
Why it matters
Talks on possible Phase 3 clinical trials come as scientists around the world are skeptical about Russia's claim that it has developed a COVID-19 vaccine proven to be both safe and effective.
Experts pointed to the lack of published and transparent scientific data on the vaccine's supposed efficacy.Questions over the vaccine called Sputnik V largely revolve around the rush to declare it ready for use despite the lack of Phase 3 testing. As the last stage in clinical trials, the step is crucial as it involves thousands of participants over several months to determine if a vaccine produces immunity as well as any significant side effects.
Among the experts who raised concerns over the vaccine was renowned US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, who ""seriously doubts"" the Sputnik V vaccine meets these standards.""Having a vaccine…and proving that a vaccine is safe and effective are two different things,"" said Fauci in a National Geographic discussion moderated by ABC News' Deborah Roberts.""I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that,"" he added.The World Health Organization has also yet to give the vaccine its stamp of approval, which would require a ""rigorous review and assessment of all the required safety and efficacy data.""Balancing risks
Despite this, President Rodrigo Duterte said the Philippines is moving forward and discussing specifics such as the possible number of doses to be allocated for the country.
Vergeire, however, tempered expectations and sought to assure the public that vaccines to be used in the Philippines will still be subject to health safety and regulatory procedures.
""Even if it went through regulatory procedures in Russia, when it arrives in the Philippines, it will still go through our own procedures. It's different when it arrives here in the country,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.""This would be a critical study and review…so we are sure [of the vaccine]….

PH to prioritize high-risk areas, sectors for COVID-19 vaccine rollout
Prioritizing the Philippines
During the briefing, Philippine Ambassador to China Jose Santiago Santa Romana said China’s offer to prioritize the Philippines in its distribution of a vaccine “still stands,” and has been reiterated by President Xi Jinping, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and other Chinese officials in recent meetings.Regarding talks with Sinovac, Santa Romana said the company sought details on the Philippines’ process for procuring doses as well as its specific needs. Sinovac officials said the company was aiming to ramp up production to500 million doses within the next 12 months.“They are ready to supply but what is important is there are continuing talks…and so we hope the talks can advanced so the procurement and deployment can happen,” Santa Romana said.Santa Romana noted while initial talks were talking place, there was a need to finalize a deal as the Philippines was not the only priority country of China.“Other ASEAN countries are involved and there other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America,” he said.Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque downplayed concerns China would use its vaccines to put pressure on the Philippines on issues like the South China Sea. Roque said the possibility of such happening “is almost nil.”
Santa Romana acknowledged that while China may be offering access to a vaccine as part of its campaign to improve Beijing’s standing in the world, making it a condition in geopolitics has not come up in discussions.
“I think the Chinese are very clear that when it comes to the Philippines, we put it on separate tracks. Where we have differences, we discuss it but if you’re going to use to press on the other, that is certainly not going to work under this administration,” he said.MUST READ

Vaccines from American vaccine makers will likely start to arrive no later than June, says Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez
The 20 million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines could arrive in the Philippines as early as end of May or early June, according to Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez.
“We’re hoping that we will have the first deliveries by either end of May or early part of June. That's our target,” said Romualdez on Friday, March 5, during a Laging Handa virtual public briefing.
The Moderna doses will arrive in batches, added the Ambassador.
This timeline is earlier than the previously announced possible arrival of Moderna vaccines in the 3rd quarter of the year, the months of July to September.
The government, in partnership with the private sector, and financed by the World Bank, has signed an agreement with Moderna pharmaceutical firm to secure 20 million doses for the country which will be divided among private companies, national government, and local governments.
""Almost half of that will go to the private sector and their employees... and then the other half will go to our health workers and the rest of the Filipinos that will be receiving the Moderna through the LGUs and other entities in the Philippines,"" said the envoy.

Romualdez also gave updates on other vaccine deals that the country has with the COVAX Facility and other American pharmaceutical companies.
COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access or COVAX, is a global initiative whose objective is the equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Spearheading this effort are Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and others.
The 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines, secured through the COVAX Facility, will arrive in the ""next couple of weeks,"" said Romualdez.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had earlier said he was expecting the Pfizer doses to reach the Philippines sometime in the 2nd quarter of the year.
According to Romualdez, the US has doubled up its production of the vaccines as per President Joe Biden’s goal to vaccinate all Americans by the end of May.
Romualdez expected the vaccines from the US to start arriving no later than June of this year all the way down to the 3rd and 4th quarter of this year.
Johnson and Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) has also committed to provide 6 million doses to the Philippines but has yet to give a definite date of the delivery because of the production priority in America.
""It can't be that only one country is COVID-free. It should be the whole world and they are aware of that and the fact that they are backing the WHO (World Health Organization) and also contributing to the COVAX Facility will give access to most countries, especially the Philippines,"" said Romualdez in a mix of English and Filipino.
Galvez is set to fly to India on March 9 to secure another deal with an American vaccine-maker, Novavax, from which the Philippines expected 30 million doses.
Romualdez said the Philippines was not being left behind by other countries in terms of vaccination rollout.“It takes time but we’re not far behind as people think. We are not far behind from many countries. Truth be told, we’re actually better off than many countries because technically we’re only [in] the first week of March when we’ve already started our vaccination program,” said the Ambassador.

A Filipino nurse in the UK administered the world’s first approved and fully tested COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, December 8, in what she described as a “historic day” showing “light at the end of the tunnel.”
Filipino nurse May Parsons delivered Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine to 90-year-old Margaret Keenan at a local hospital in Coventry. Keenan is the first person in world to get the vaccine, approved just a week ago in Britain.“I’m just glad that I’m able to play a part in this historic day,” Parsons said in a statement released by the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). “The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel.”
“I’m happy it’s happened and now I’ve done it and hopefully more people come along and do as I did, you know?” Keenan told CNN.The moment watched by the world was not lost on Parsons, who has worked with the NHS for 24 years.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she encouraged the public to avail of the vaccine.
""It's important that we're making this as popular as can be for everyone to take,"" Parsons said.
The UK is the first country in the world to mount a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19, with the elderly, vulnerable, and front line health workers among the first in line to receive the shot in the program.The historic moment, which came after an unprecedented worldwide sprint to produce a safe and effective vaccine, marked a milestone in the pandemic that has so far killed over 1.5 million people and sickened over 67 million.British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce described Keenan’s experience as a “fantastic moment” as he recognized Parson's service at the NHS.“A fantastic moment! And great to see that the vaccine is administered by Nurse May Parsons from the Philippines – one of the many thousands of Filipino healthcare workers making such an enormous contribution to the NHS,” Pruce tweeted.UK State Minister Nigel Adams said the country was “proud” to have dedicated health workers like Parsons.
Parsons is among the nearly 20,000 Filipinos who make up the staff of the NHS, UK's healthcare system. Filipinos rank third following British and Indian staff.Filipino nurses have been recognized worldwide for their contribution to foreign health systems across Europe, the Middle East, and North America, among others.
While many have been hailed for their dedication, their service on the front lines also means Filipino health workers have been one of the hardest-hit groups, suffering from high death rates during the pandemic.MUST READ

(UPDATED) Soldiers who do not want to avail of vaccines from the national stockpile would have to pay for it themselves
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) ordered all 150,000 of its soldiers and their dependents to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), AFP spokesman Major General Edgard Arevalo said in a press briefing on Thursday, February 25.
""Ang Sandatahang Lakas ng Pilipinas is not like any organization. Tayo po ay service-oriented organization. Tayo po ang inaasahan sa mararaming mabibigay na tungkulin tulad ng pagharap ng pandemya. Kaya hindi opsyon ang pag-ayaw,"" Arevalo said in an online briefing.
(The Armed Forces of the Philippines is not like any organization. We are a service-oriented organization. Many rely on us on numerous matters, including facing the pandemic. So, refusal is not an option.)
The AFP will subsidize their vaccination if the jabs are available from the national stockpile. The first batch of this will be the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines set to arrive on February 28. Some 100,000 doses were reserved for the military.
The military gets this big share from the first shipment despite being categorized as the 4th priority group for vaccinations, following frontline medical workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities.
If soldiers do not want to use the Sinovac vaccine, they would have to look for a vaccine and pay for it themselves. So far, this option is not possible as there are no commercially available vaccines in the country.
Asked if this means that soldiers have no choice but to take in the Sinovac vaccine, Arevalo said, ""That may be the case.""
On Thursday afternoon, however, the Department of Health announced the rollout of Sinovac was placed “on hold” as it has yet to get the recommendation and approval of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).
The AFP has an estimated 150,000 personnel. If they end up receiving 100,000 doses, that means 50,000 will get the required 2 doses. Arevalo said they will prioritize AFP members who are medical workers and frontliners.

'Wala pong pilian,' says Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque as the government announces that a Chinese vaccine could be the first to be rolled out to priority groups
Health workers, elderly, and indigent persons who refuse to be given the first COVID-19 vaccine to be offered to them by the government will lose their priority slot and wait for another vaccine along with the general population, said Malacañang on Monday, January 11.
The policy was explained by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque after news broke that a Chinese vaccine could be the first to be given to priority groups as early as February, if regulatory agencies approve.
Roque said that those who reject an offered vaccine will be asked to sign a waiver signifying their refusal to get the free jabs.
""Wala pong pilian, wala kasing pilitan. Pero magsa-sign ka ng waiver na hindi ka nagpaturok,"" he said during a Palace press briefing.
(No choosing, because there's no forcing. But you'll sign a waiver that you decided not to get vaccinated.)
""At kung mayroon kang prayoridad, siyempre, mawawala 'yung prayoridad mo, sasama ka sa the rest of the taumbayan na naghihintay ng bakuna,"" he continued.
(And if you're in the priority groups, of course, your priority slot would be gone, you would have to join the rest of the population waiting for a vaccine.)
Roque said this policy is ""only right"" because the government won't be able to choose which COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately available to the Philippines since this is partly dependent on supplies of vaccine developers.
""We all have rights to good health, but you can't choose because so many Filipinos need to be vaccinated,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
This vaccine policy has yet to be formalized in a task force resolution, but Roque said officials have reached a ""consensus"" on it.
Order of vaccines arrival
The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in the Philippines will likely be CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by Chinese firm Sinovac. An initial batch of 50,000 doses is expected to arrive in February, with batches arriving throughout the year until arrivals reach 25 million doses in December.
Because CoronaVac requires two doses, this amount is only good for 12.5 million Filipinos, roughly half of the 24.6 million Filipinos in the priority list of the government.
What could fill in the gap are the other vaccines the government is trying to secure but are set to arrive later in the year. The first batch of 30 million doses of Covovax, the vaccine of American firm Novavax, is expected to arrive around July to September. Around this time also, doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, secured by Philippine private firms and various local governments, are seen to arrive.
All of those vaccine rollouts will depend on the issuance of an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Without an EUA, none of the vaccines can be administered.
So far, only AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Russia's Gamaleya Institute – developer of the Sputnik V vaccine – have applied for an EUA.
Roque, however, said he expects Sinovac to submit its application in the next few days.
Trust in vaccines
Some Phase 3 trials of the Sinovac vaccine have shown an efficacy of 78%, a better rating than the AstraZeneca vaccine. But details from these trials remain unpublished at this time. (READ: [ANALYSIS] The Chinese COVID-19 vaccines, Sinopharm and Sinovac, are effective)
Since July, it's been used in China for vulnerable sectors. However, no stringent regulatory agency, like the World Health Organization, European Union, or United States agencies have approved this vaccine.
But countries where clinical trials were performed, like Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil, are expected to issue emergency use approval soon.
Roque said the government would wait for the Philippine FDA to issue an EUA before administering Sinovac's vaccine to Filipinos.

Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo says company officials claimed they already had enough data for their candidate vaccine
COVID-19 vaccine developer AstraZeneca has withdrawn its application to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed on Friday, December 11.“They said they already have enough data,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said in a message to Rappler.Asked when the company stopped its application, Domingo said his staff informed of him of the development today.
AstraZeneca’s decision to withdraw its application comes just days after it secured the endorsement of the Philippines’ research ethics board, one of the requirements needed to conduct trials in the country. Last December 4, Dr Nina Gloriani, head of the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel, said the group was waiting for the company to respond to its comments before it decided whether to endorse its application to the FDA.
AstraZeneca, which developed its vaccine with the University of Oxford, became the first COVID-19 vaccine candidate to have efficacy results from phase 3 trials published in peer-reviewed journal The Lancet. Its study published earlier this week confirmed initial trial data that showed their vaccine was 70% effective in protecting against symptomatic COVID-19.
While the company pulled out is application, Domingo earlier said conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines is not a prerequisite for a vaccine to be registered for use in the country.The Philippines has so far secured from the company an initial 2.6 million doses for about 1.5 million Filipinos through an agreement with the Philippine government and private sector.The doses will be split in half between the government and businesses that chipped in for the P700-million deal.On top of this, Galvez said the firm would be setting aside 20 million doses for the Philippines, each priced at “more or less $5.”

Initial doses of Pfizer and Sinovac vaccines may arrive as early as February, when the Duterte government plans to start its mass immunization campaign against COVID-19
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said COVID-19 vaccines developed by United States drugmaker Pfizer, China's Sinovac, and the United Kingdom's AstraZeneca may be among the first to arrive in the Philippines.
Galvez identified the 3 vaccines based on the current status of negotiations that the government is holding with pharmaceutical companies and multilateral initiatives, including international group GAVI's COVAX facility.
The COVAX facility guarantees access to a portfolio of vaccines and doses for at least 20% of the population of participating countries. It is run by GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and the World Health Organization (WHO).
""The 3 vaccines that will arrive first either way – if we can negotiate an early rollout – first, Pfizer, second, Sinovac, and then AstraZeneca,"" Galvez said in a virtual briefing on Wednesday, January 13.He earlier announced that the Duterte government could begin distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the public as soon as February, when the first doses of either Sinovac or Pfizer's vaccine arrive.

If the Philippines is among the countries where doses would be delivered, supplies may come as soon as February, WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said.
In the Philippines, Pfizer has applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is expected to announce its decision this week.Sinovac earlier told Philippine officials that an initial delivery of at least 50,000 doses could be delivered in February, though this would still depend on whether the company secures emergency approval from the FDA.
Galvez said the company is expected to submit an application for EUA within the next few days after it consolidates findings from Phase 3 clinical trials in Turkey and Brazil.

Best price for Filipinos?
During the briefing, Galvez also defended the government's negotiations after lawmakers questioned why Sinovac is among the vaccine brands favored for procurement despite its reportedly higher price compared to other brands.
Galvez said that during negotiations, price points being offered were much lower than market prices which are publicly available. He declined to divulge Sinovac's exact price as talks with the company are bound by confidentiality agreements until a deal is finalized.Instead, Galvez described Sinovac's price to be midrange, supposedly cheaper than those being offered by American pharmaceutical firms.

(3rd UPDATE) The private sector is still looking for more manufacturers to boost the Philippines' vaccine stockpile
Over 30 business leaders inked a deal with the Philippine government for 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, worth around P700 million, on Friday, November 27.
Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion led the signing ceremony, along with vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr and Lotis Ramin, country president of AstraZeneca Philippines.
Half of the vaccines, expected to arrive around the 2nd quarter of 2021, will be donated to the government, while the other half will be for employees in the private sector.

Key to this agreement were the efforts of the embassy of the United Kingdom led by Ambassador Daniel Pruce. Galvez has been saying for days that he had been in talks with the embassy on vaccine supply.
Concepcion also attributed the deal's success to SM's Tessie Sy-Coson and BDO president and chief executive officer Nestor Tan.
He noted that Coson and Tan helped reach out to AstraZeneca. Concepcion likewise called several business leaders while the talks were ongoing.
""Two weeks of calling, I sound like a beggar calling for everybody. But it turned around and we have a lot of support from the private sector,"" Concepcion said.
He added that the private sector is looking for more sources of the vaccine aside from AstraZeneca, as the 2.6 million vaccines can only benefit up to 1.5 million people.
The vaccine is expected to cost around P500 or $10 for two doses.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is being developed with Oxford University in the UK.
The pharmaceutical firm has reported its vaccine is 70% effective against COVID-19. But experts have raised doubts after finding out that the second group of participants in the AstraZeneca trials were limited to people aged 55 and below, an age group with a lower risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.
But it’s still a long way to go before the 2.6 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses are actually distributed to Filipinos.The vaccine will still have to pass the UK's regulatory process and get approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration. This critical approval could come as early as May to July 2021 or late next year, said Galvez.
Half to private sector
Christian Gonzalez of the Enrique Razon Jr-led International Container Terminals Services Incorporated (ICTSI), one of the private companies making the donation, said the ""vast majority"" of initial vaccine recipients will be ""government employees, frontline health workers, and other essential services workers"" as designated by the Department of Health.
ICTSI will use its share of the vaccine supply for its employees and those of the entire Razon Group, said Gonzalez.
But the firm will also devote some of its doses to employees of the Philippine Ports Authority, Bureau of Customs, and other essential port and logistics workers – frontliners who ""made the biggest impact, especially at the beginning of the pandemic,"" said Gonzalez.
The private sector has played a big role in the Philippines' pandemic response. From donations of various goods, to testing employees and poor households, conglomerates have stepped in, as the government has drawn flak for how it is handling the crisis.
'Affordable'
Galvez told President Rodrigo Duterte that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is the most affordable vaccine among those being negotiated for by the government, priced at around $5 per dose.
""At nakita natin ang AstraZeneca po maganda po dahil kasi non-profit po ang sa kanya at saka pinakamababa po ‘yung kanyang presyo, more or less $5 lang po,"" the vaccine czar said during the November 23 meeting.
(We can see that AstraZeneca is good because it's non-profit and it has the lowest price, more or less $5 only.)
Galvez praised AstraZeneca and the UK embassy for their ""goal of providing equitable access"" to the vaccine to developing countries like the Philippines.
Apart from AstraZeneca, Galvez has spoken of securing ""20 to 50 million doses"" of China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.
The Philippines aims to inoculate 60 million to 70 million Filipinos within 3 to 5 years. Some 35 million will belong to the first batch of recipients, a mix of poor households, healthcare workers, and frontline personnel.
To purchase these vaccines, the government is targeting a budget of P73.2 billion.

'Once we have an emergency use authorization mechanism in place, the process will be faster,' says FDA Director General Eric Domingo
With President Rodrigo Duterte set to issue an emergency use authorization or EUA, coronavirus vaccines could arrive in the country before the second quarter of 2021.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo said during a virtual press briefing on Friday, November 20, that the EUA would hasten the government vaccine procurement plan.
In his reply to queries about the effect of an EUA, Doming said: ""Once we have an EUA mechanism in place. Once nakakuha na sila ng (they have the) EUA , for example in the US FDA, mas mapapabilis talaga ang proseso (the process will quicken). We’re able to look at the evaluation that are done by these mature and advanced regulatory agencies,"" Domingo said.
Malacañang said on Thursday, November 19, that Duterte already approved ""in principle"" the request of the health department for an EUA.
An EUA would speed up the processing time for approval of COVID-19 vaccines that would enter the country – from 6 months to 21 days.
It would be an order from the President to create an express lane that would skip the usual red tape and load of paperwork which bog down vaccine purchases.
Earlier, DOH assured the public that fast-tracking would not mean compromising on quality studies.
""We have the vaccine expert panel at the start, and the FDA would continuously monitor this technology kahit nabigyan na nila ng rehistro sa ating bansa (even though they are already registered in our country),"" said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a previous briefing.
In September, the FDA said that in a ""best case scenario,"" the earliest possible availability of a coronavirus vaccine in the Philippines would be by April 2021.
On Tuesday, November 17, Pfizer's Albert Bourla said that they were ""very close"" to applying for an emergency use approval for its COVID-19 vaccine after collecting safety data to submit to US regulators.
Moderna has previously said it expects to apply for an EUA by November 25.
The Philippines is currently looking at 17 possible sources of vaccines from various countries. Out of the 17, 9 are now undergoing the 3rd phase of trials, with Pfizer and Moderna reporting promising results, both with 95% efficacy in their phase 3 clinical trials results.

Malacañang said Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is willing to go first in line for a COVID-19 vaccine once it is approved for domestic use by the country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in order to convince more Filipinos to get immunized.
""Kung papayagan na po ng FDA, I think po mauuna ang Presidente and nag-volunteer naman po siya. In fact, gustong-gusto na niya,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Monday, December 7, during a press briefing.
(If the FDA will approve, I think the President would go first and he already volunteered. In fact, he really wants it.)
Roque called Duterte the ""best communication tool"" to convince more Filipinos to get vaccinated against COVID-19, amid fears of vaccination programs that grew partly because of the Dengvaxia controversy in 2017.
""Ang Presidente po, naku, hindi na makahintay. Gusto niyang talagang turukan na siya na mapakita sa buong bayan na ligtas at epektibo, ito po’y dumaan sa expert panel group ng pinakadalubhasang Pilipino,"" said the spokesman.
(The President can't wait. He really wants to get vaccinated to show the country that it is safe and effective, it went through a panel composed of Filipino experts.)
In August, Duterte said he was willing to get vaccinated, in public, against SARS-CoV-2 using the Russian-developed Sputnik V.
The FDA has yet to issue Emergency Use Approval (EUA) for any COVID-19 vaccine. But its director general, Eric Domingo, said the process could be as fast as 21 days once a vaccine manufacturer gets an EUA from its home country and submits complete data to the Philippine government.
Domingo's best-case scenario would be a Philippine EUA in January, which could mean distribution starting in March given the capacity of vaccine manufacturers to churn out doses for all the countries which reserved supply.
In the meantime, the national coronavirus task force has determined the 25 million Filipinos who will get vaccinated first. The list is led by medical frontliners and indigent senior citizens.

Initial doses of the vaccines are expected to arrive as early as the 3rd quarter of 2021
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said that the government has signed two more agreements with pharmaceutical firms to secure at least 25 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines for Filipinos.Galvez gave the update during a virtual press briefing on Wednesday, February 17, as he flashed figures of vaccines eyed by the Philippine government for delivery in 2021. Among new agreements signed included those with Moderna for 20 million doses of its vaccine and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica) for 5 million doses of its single-dose coronavirus shot.Galvez’s presentation indicated that term sheets with the American pharmaceutical firms had been signed and that these companies have committed to supply doses to the Philippines. Term sheets are the second to the last step in vaccine negotiations and were necessary for locking in logistics needed for production and delivery.Initial doses of Moderna and Johnson and Johnson’s vaccines were expected to arrive in the Philippines as early as the 3rd quarter of 2021, with additional supply slated for delivery in the 4th quarter.While the deals assure Filipinos access to limited global supply, a supply agreement will still need to be signed with these companies to facilitate actual purchase and payment, as well as set a definite date for delivery.
Both Moderna and Johnson and Johnson will also need to secure emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before it could be rolled out to the public.So far, the FDA has granted emergency use approval for Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s vaccine, though FDA Director General Eric Domingo said Moderna has expressed interest in applying for an EUA.
Johnson & Johnson is expected to start Phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine in the Philippines in the coming weeks, after the FDA approved its application to hold late-stage trials in the country.SCREENSHOT FROM RTVM
Why it matters
With term sheets signed with Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, Galvez said the government has secured enough doses needed to vaccinate at least 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year.Aside from the two companies, the Philippines is also eyeing to purchase 25 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, while a tripartite agreement is being considered for 10 to 15 million doses of Gamaleya’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine.Prior to this, term sheets had been signed to secure 30 million doses of Novavax’ vaccine, 17 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, and 25 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine.On top of this, the Philippines is also expecting up to 44 million doses from the COVAX global facility.MUST READ
TIMELINE: The Philippines’ 2021 COVID-19 vaccine plan
Galvez earlier said the government is targeting to start the rollout of vaccines by February, though the lack of an indemnification program in the country has hindered the delivery of an initial 117,000 Pfizer vaccines from COVAX. Government lawyers have signed an indemnification agreement with the global vaccine facility to facilitate the delivery of vaccines which could be expected in the coming week, he added.Once vaccines arrive, health officials plan to vaccinate some 2 to 3 million people per week to reach its target of inoculating at least 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of 2021.The Philippines’ total vaccine orders are pegged at about 178 million, largely in anticipation of delays and other complications in scarce global supply. – Rappler.com

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire says that for now, they only have an 'indicative' schedule of the arrival of the vaccine doses
The Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday, February 10, that there is ""no confirmed date"" yet on the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines as the country prepares for its vaccination program.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing that what Gavi vaccine alliance COVAX facility told them was an ""indicative date"" or tentative schedule, which is the 2nd or 3rd week of February.
""The February 15 is an indicative date, when we say indicative date that is tentative schedule. No confirmed date yet on when are we going to start,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Vergeire issued the statement when asked about the arrival of the vaccines in the country so as not to give ""false hopes"" to Filipinos. She added that they will give the exact date of the start of the vaccination program once they get the confirmation of the vaccine arrival.
This comes after Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the government would be ready to start its vaccination program by February 15. He later clarified though that start of vaccination will still depend on the arrival of the vaccines from the COVAX facility.
Though they could not give the exact date of the vaccination program, the government – led by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez – on Tuesday held a simulation exercise of the vaccine arrival in the country, including the pickup of the vaccine supplies from the airport.Vergeire said the simulation was done to avoid vaccine wastage.
Meanwhile, the DOH said on Monday that that all vaccine operation centers in local government units located in Metro Manila, Central Visayas, and Davao should be fully activated by February 10.– Rappler.com

'Instead of aiming at the hoop, he scratched his balls so he dropped the ball even as time was running out,' says Senator Panfilo Lacson in a cryptic tweet
The Philippines would have been in line to receive 10 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in January 2021, if Health Secretary Francisco Duque III had not “dropped the ball” on an arrangement passed onto him by other officials, said Senator Panfilo Lacson.
In a cryptic tweet on Thursday, December 17, Lacson shared what he called a “direct quote.”
“In July, we passed the ball to him. Instead of aiming at the hoop, he scratched his balls so he dropped the ball even as time was running out. Then, Singapore grabbed and shot the ball,” Lacson said.
The senator then capped off his tweet, “Now, they have the vaccines and we don’t.”
Rappler asked Lacson to clarify whom he was quoting in his tweet, but he has yet to reply to our query as of this posting.
However, the previous night, he sent reporters a message in which he mentioned Duque in relation to an earlier tweet by Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, who said someone had “dropped the ball” in making arrangements with Pfizer for the vaccines.

Locsin shares foiled plan to secure 10M Pfizer vaccine doses by January
Citing a phone conversation he had with Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, Lacson said Locsin and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were already negotiating “as early as July,” as arranged by Romualdez.
“Thus, they could have secured the delivery of 10 million Pfizer vaccines as early as January next year, way ahead of Singapore, but for the indifference of Secretary Duque, who failed to work on the necessary documentary requirement namely, the Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA) as he should have done,” Lacson said.
Even Pfizer’s country representative had been following up on the CDA but to no avail, he added.
Lacson then lamented how many lives will have been saved if the Pfizer vaccines were made available to Filipinos by January 2021. Although Duque claimed ongoing talks between the pharmaceutical company and the government, Lacson said the Philippines already missed what would have been the early first salvo of deliveries of the vaccines.
If it is true that Duque “dropped the ball” in arrangements for the Pfizer vaccine, then he may be sued for “gross and inexcusable negligence under the anti-graft law,” said Senator Francis Pangilinan on Thursday.
The Senate Committee of the Whole is set to hold a legislative inquiry into the government’s plans on rolling out COVID-19 vaccines. Pangilinan said this will be crucial not only in checking the readiness of those plans, but also in ferreting out any attempts at overpricing.
“Millions of lives are at stake here,” Pangilinan said.
Duque on Wednesday denied he had been negligent in the matter, and said negotiations with Pfizer for the vaccines are still underway.
Peace Process Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr, the country’s COVID-19 vaccine czar and chief implementer of policies on the pandemic, earlier said Pfizer's vaccine may arrive in the Philippines by the 3rd quarter of 2021 at the earliest, along with the bulk of other vaccines eyed by the government.

(UPDATED) These vaccines will be the Philippines' very first batch of COVID-19 jabs
The first batch of Sinovac vaccines is scheduled to arrive in the Philippines on Sunday, February 28, announced Malacañang.
""We expect that the delivery will arrive on Sunday,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in Filipino on Thursday, February 25.
These vaccines will be the Philippines' very first batch of COVID-19 jabs. The country lags behind some of its Southeast Asian neighbors like Indonesia and Malaysia, who have kickstarted their vaccination drives.
Government officials will be physically welcoming the arrival of the much-awaited vaccines, added Roque.
A Sinovac executive, general manager Helen Yang, previously said that the first delivery involves 600,000 doses, all of which are donated. They will arrive all together in a military plane. Of this, 100,000 have been reserved for the military.
President Rodrigo Duterte had wanted to be present in the welcoming ceremony for the vaccines but his attendance is not yet confirmed.
In a statement posted on Facebook, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said the delivery of the Philippines' first COVID-19 doses is a testament to the “profound friendship and partnership” between Manila and Beijing.
“It is a fine tradition between China and the Philippines to help each other in trying times. A friend in need is a friend indeed.... I hope the vaccines will help kick off Philippines’ mass inoculation campaign to curb the pandemic and allow Filipinos’ life to return to normal at the earliest,” Huang said.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had previously said it would take ""2 to 3 days"" after the arrival of vaccines for the government to administer the first doses to priority Filipinos.
CoronaVac, Sinovac's vaccine, was approved for emergency use just last Monday, February 22, but government experts do not recommend its use for health workers, which had been identified as the first priority of the vaccination program.
But government experts are still in deliberations to finalize the guidelines for CoronaVac. Malacañang has said health workers can still get the Sinovac vaccine if they wanted because the Food and Drug Administration only recommends against it but does not prohibit such use.

At least 5.6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from two pharmaceutical companies are expected to arrive in the Philippines within the 1st quarter of 2021 through the global initiative COVAX.
These will ""jump-start the country's national vaccination program as part of the global efforts to stop the spread of [the] coronavirus,"" said vaccine czar and National Task Force Against COVID-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr in a statement on Sunday, January 31.
The COVAX Facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), will provide 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. ""These are expected to be delivered in mid-February and will cover the 1st quarter supply commitment,"" Galvez added.
The country will also receive 5,500,800 to 9,290,400 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. AstraZeneca is still waiting for emergency use listing from the WHO.
""The 'indicative' numbers of [AstraZeneca] doses reflect only the supply for the first two quarters of 2021. The initial delivery is scheduled by mid to late February as stated in the letter,"" Galvez said.
Aurélia Nguyen, managing director of the COVAX Facility, informed the Philippine government about these in a letter.
The government had received confirmation on January 20 that it would be among the countries included in the COVAX distribution of vaccines for an early rollout.
Galvez then noted that according to COVAX, ""the number of doses and the projected arrival of the vaccines are all indicative since it all depends on the global supply.""
""The vaccines under COVAX can now inoculate our healthcare workers, medical-related personnel, and other frontliners,"" he said.

Over 200 Philippine companies have ""expressed their pledge and interest"" in buying doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British company AstraZeneca, according to Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion.
""This only means that the business community is very serious in ensuring that our economy will remain open while slowly ending this war,"" Concepcion said in a recent statement, adding that ""more than 200 companies already expressed their pledge and interest, and still counting.""
Concepcion said among them were:
Ayala Corporation - 400,000 doses
Palawan Pawnshop - 100,000 doses
Okada Manila - 40,000 doses
Uratex Philippines - 21,000 doses
Century Pacific Food - 20,000 doses
Unioil Petroleum Philippines, Inc - 20,000 doses
Golden Arches Development Corporation - 15,000 doses
Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. - 10,000 doses
Vaccination of each person takes two doses. Each dose of AstraZeneca is still at its base cost of $5, said Concepcion, or around P241.50.
In a first batch in November, over 30 business leaders signed a deal with the Philippine government for 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine worth around P700 million.
In that deal, half of the vaccines will be donated to the government and half will be for employees of the private sector. The vaccines of that first procurement are expected to arrive around the 2nd quarter of 2021.
AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University in the United Kingdom, reports a 70% effectivity rate against COVID-19.However, experts have raised doubts with the vaccine because the second group of participants in the clinical trial were aged 55 and below, an age range said to be of lower risk to developing severe coronavirus symptoms.Concepcion said that they have been in talks with microfinance institutions (MFIs) to kickstart plans on procuring vaccine doses as well, in order to revive MFIs. Helping MFIs will revive the assistance to Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises or MSMEs.
""The more businesses involved in this project, the faster the ecosystem will be revived, thus, stimulating exchange. It is one answer to the question of how we get money flowing again – it will stop the bleeding,"" said Concepcion.
Concepcion said the private sector's effort is a complement to the government's effort.
""If the private sector will not help, the economy will remain restricted,"" said Concepcion.
The Duterte government has been under scrutiny for a slow-paced process in getting the Pfizer vaccine, with Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr saying ""somebody dropped the ball,"" alluding to embattled Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.

Over half a million of vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility will not arrive as expected on Monday, March 1, due to a ""global supply problem,"" according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.

(UPDATED) The interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group says health workers can still opt not to get the Sinovac vaccine
The Department of Health's (DOH) advisory group has approved the use of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine for Philippine healthcare workers but said those who prefer another brand would not be penalized.
The interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) made the announcement in a virtual press briefing hosted by the DOH on Friday afternoon, February 26.
""Really, the Sinovac vaccine that we evaluated is safe for use for healthcare workers. We need to protect them. And since ito ang available ngayon e kailangan nating gamitin (this is what is available now, we need to use it),"" said Dr Maria Consorcia Quizon of NITAG.
Dr Edsel Salvana of the DOH technical advisory group (TAG) said that based on NITAG's studies, Sinovac's CoronaVac ""looks like it will save lives and so it is but right to offer to the people on the frontlines who have been saving lives.""
""If they don't think this is the right vaccine for them, we will not penalize them,"" Salvana added.
'Safe' to offer to health workers
Dr Ana Ong -Lim, also a member of TAG, said that the first batch of the vaccines that would arrive in the country would need to be allocated rationally because vaccine resource is ""very scarce.""
""After much deliberation, nakapagkasundaan ng NITAG at TAG na sulit pa rin na ito ayi-alok sa ating heath workers at mabigyan sila ng pagkakataon based on their own understanding sa mga ibibigay nating information kung gusto nila itong tanggapin or hindi,"" she said.
(After much deliberation, NITAG and TAG have agreed that these vaccine is still worth offering to our health workers and to give them the option to decide for themselves whether to accept it or not, based on their own understanding of the information that we will give them.)
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that they are still finalizing the list of hospitals that would receive the first batch of the vaccines but the ones to be prioritized are healthcare workers in COVID-19 dedicated hospitals.
The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and the Lung Center of the Philippines are among the known COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in the country.
On Friday, healthcare workers at PGH demanded free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines.
Malacañang welcomed the development. ""The Sinovac vaccine is expected to arrive on Sunday, February 28, and we are confident that many of our healthcare workers would get themselves inoculated to boost public confidence in our mass vaccination program against the coronavirus,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.
Sinovac’s CoronaVac will be the first batch of vaccines to arrive in the Philippines.
The Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Sinovac emergency use authorization but recommended against administering it to health workers with high exposure to the disease.FDA Director General Eric Domingo said its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The agency instead recommended its use to people aged 18 to 59 after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
The DOH said that a separate media briefing will be held to announce the kick off of the country's vaccination program.

Mayors get resourceful to lock in vaccine doses at a time when the national government scrambles to finalize deals for the country as a whole
Back-to-back announcements by cities in the Philippines about agreements inked with developers of COVID-19 vaccines have brought a glimmer of hope to many Filipinos weary of the pandemic.
Finally, there was something somewhat solid for Filipinos amid enviable news from other countries, where health workers and the elderly are already getting the sought-after jabs.
Many could not help but compare the speed by which cities signed deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca against the fact that the national government itself had yet to enter into any agreement. (LIST: Local governments' plans for COVID-19 vaccines)
""Many local government units opted to go on their own. They buy, because they have the money, and they chose their own vaccine,"" acknowledged President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 13.
Before cities began signing their vaccine deals, the only other signed agreement to secure doses was initiated and financially backed by private corporations like Udenna Corporation, Aboitiz Foundation, BDO Foundation, and others.Though all these agreements could not have been signed without the participation of the national government, it was the efforts of mayors and corporate executives that catalyzed and quickly shepherded the process.
How did the mayors of several cities in Metro Manila and across the country secure these agreements? What can other mayors or governors learn from their experience?
Rappler reporters spoke with the following local officials to find out:
Mayor Rex Gatchalian of Valenzuela City
Mayor Francis Zamora of San Juan City
Mayor Joy Belmonte of Quezon City and Joseph Juico, co-chairperson of Quezon City's vaccine task force
Mayor Sara Duterte of Davao City
How their efforts began
Deals were finalized and signed in early January, but most mayors began initial efforts to scout for a vaccine supplier months before.
Mayor Duterte said she began sending unsolicited letters to various vaccine makers in October 2020.
Around this time, Quezon City had also begun scouting around, according to Juico. By late November, Quezon City had begun talks with vaccine developers and had asked national government agencies on how they could proceed, Mayor Belmonte said.
In these months, mayors were walking blind, with the national government not having cascaded any clear plan on coordination for vaccine procurement.
It was only in early November when vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr publicly presented an initial National Vaccine Roadmap, where the only mentioned involvement of the local governments would be in identifying recipients, distributing vaccines, and rolling out information campaigns.
But, by the end of that month, private firms managed to ink a deal with AstraZeneca for 3 million doses. The national government was part of the deal since AstraZeneca had told corporation executives it needed the government involved.It was also in November when firms like Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute began announcing efficacy rates from Phase III trials of their vaccines, creating excitement and then clamor from the public. A 70% efficacy rating was found for AstraZeneca’s vaccine in a study published on December 8.
So, without the national government’s hand, mayors moved independently to contact vaccine makers. Belmonte got a number of an AstraZeneca executive from private doctors. Mayor Duterte, in an October meeting with the British embassy on another matter, discussed vaccines and was told to write to AstraZeneca for access, a suggestion she took.
Duterte had also asked officials at the Chinese consulate in Davao City “for options,” which led them to put her in touch with Sinovac. In the same way, a United States embassy official sent her an email, asking if they could help the city, and she responded. The embassy then endorsed a meeting with US firm Johnson & Johnson, whose pharmaceutical company, Janssen, is slated to conduct vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines.
Matters speed up in January
As of late November and early December, mayors like Belmonte and Valenzuela’s Gatchalian had still been hesitant to sign anything solid or make any orders with vaccine firms.
For Belmonte, this was because they didn’t think it wise to finalize an order without the guidance of the Food and Drug Administration, the agency that would identify which vaccines could be administered and distributed in the country.
San Juan’s Zamora said he also wanted to keep their options open for the possibility of sourcing vaccines from other providers. He said he did not want to “over-order” either, as they anticipated the national government to allocate vaccines for them.
It was in early December when Galvez had meetings with Metro Manila mayors where he explained the national government’s vaccine plans.
According to Zamora, Galvez had given local government units (LGUs) the go signal to procure vaccines on their own as long as mayors would coordinate with the national government.
But, in Davao City, Mayor Sara, the President’s daughter, had not yet heard of any vaccine coordination plan from the national government.
On December 10, she said the national government should let LGUs access vaccine deals on their own.
“In my opinion, if they allow LGUs to move on their own to access vaccines approved by the national government, then the LGUs may be able to help the national government move the vaccines to a large segment of the population,” she said over Davao City Disaster Radio.

It was on December 15 when Quezon City was able to get in touch with AstraZeneca officials. The firm sent them the next day a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which was reviewed by the city’s legal department then sent back to AstraZeneca on December 17, said Juico.
A few days before Christmas, December 22, city hall and AstraZeneca officials sat down for a meeting to discuss the vaccine.
After a lull due to the holidays, the United Kingdom regulatory agency (Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) announced its emergency use approval for AstraZeneca’s vaccine on December 30.
When Juico called up AstraZeneca after the news, he was told things would have to move faster.
“That’s when they said we have to move quickly because it’s approved by the UK and they need to talk with Mayor because a certain number of doses is available for allocation for QC,” Juico said.
Belmonte swung into action, calling up Galvez on January 1 to get clearance from the national government.
“Secretary Galvez acted quickly. On the same day, he texted the parameters and then called Mayor to say the President has already agreed that LGUs can enter into tripartite agreements as long as national government takes the lead,” said Juico.
Valenzuela City and San Juan City had a similar experience, though they had reached out to AstraZeneca weeks after Quezon City.
From a wait-and-see stance in early December, things moved quickly once the cities had contacted AstraZeneca on the first week of January. The entire process, from first contact to signing of an agreement, took just one week, according to Zamora and Gatchalian.
What Gatchalian found helpful was how efficient AstraZeneca was, the guidance from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, and the framework provided by the tripartite agreement.
Another reason why deals with AstraZeneca pushed through faster than the rest was because the firm had agreed to the tripartite agreement model with national government.
This type of agreement has proven crucial to locking in vaccine doses because it entails an assurance of payment and orders that the national government has been hesitant to make due to procurement laws.
For LGUs, engaging in a tripartite agreement also assures them that the deals they are signing comply with the national government’s guidelines, which have not been clear.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque had said this about the first such tripartite deal, the one with private corporations. He said it was one way to reserve vaccines without fear of violating procurement regulations since it was another entity promising to pay for the supply.
The other work-around devised by Galvez was to use funding from the Asian Development Bank for advance orders since procurement laws don’t cover international aid. But for this funding to be released, the ADB requires that the vaccine to be procured must have approval from a mature regulatory agency.
What local governments commit to do in vaccine deals
According to the tripartite agreements, the local governments will take charge of the vaccines they order – from payment to administering doses to their citizens.
“They will buy, they will pay, they will pay for all the expenses, including delivery of vaccines, and they will also vaccinate their constituents in accordance with the National Vaccination Plan,” said Roque in a press briefing on Tuesday, January 12.
Roque had bared provisions in the agreements entered into by cities, AstraZeneca, and the national government during the briefing. One of these provisions says payments of local governments need not pass through the national government, but will go straight to AstraZeneca.
Local governments are also in charge of paying for and coordinating the delivery of the vaccines to their areas.
This level of involvement of local governments was nowhere to be found in Galvez’s initial November 3 vaccine plan.
It was later on, absent more concrete moves from the national government, when mayors “offered” this level of involvement.
“It was the LGUs who offered their help to the NTF (National Task Force), the national government, to buy vaccines for their constituents,” said Roque.
In meetings with Metro Manila mayors, Galvez had expressed gratitude to the local chiefs for their initiative.
How about LGUs without resources to secure vaccine doses?
The mayors of Metro Manila and other highly-urbanized cities like Davao City, Bacolod City, and Antipolo City have big budgets. Davao City is even led by the President’s daughter. But what of smaller or less influential cities or provinces?
Malacañang has given assurances that they won’t be left behind.
“No! Because the national government, the NTF, is prepared to buy for everyone,” said Roque in Filipino.
Finally, on Monday, January 11, the national government signed an agreement with US firm Novavax for 30 million doses of its vaccine. Soon after, it also signed a deal with China’s Sinovac for 25 million doses.
Yet all these agreements – whether signed by the national government, cities, or private firms – are hinged on the all-important emergency use approval by the FDA. Without this approval, the agreements can’t be implemented. So far, only the Pfizer vaccine has been granted emergency use approval.
In the coming months, all eyes will be on how well the Duterte administration coordinates with mayors and governors to ensure an efficient and equitable vaccine roll-out. – with reports from Rambo Talabong and Jodesz Gavilan/Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-01-14 16:09:00,"Many could not help but compare the speed by which cities signed deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca against the fact that the national government itself had yet to enter into any agreement.Rappler reporters spoke with the following local officials to find out: Mayor Rex Gatchalian of Valenzuela City Mayor Francis Zamora of San Juan City Mayor Joy Belmonte of Quezon City and Joseph Juico, co-chairperson of Quezon City's vaccine task force Mayor Sara Duterte of Davao City How their efforts began Deals were finalized and signed in early January, but most mayors began initial efforts to scout for a vaccine supplier months before.But, by the end of that month, private firms managed to ink a deal with AstraZeneca for 3 million doses.Matters speed up in January As of late November and early December, mayors like Belmonte and Valenzuela’s Gatchalian had still been hesitant to sign anything solid or make any orders with vaccine firms.It was in early December when Galvez had meetings with Metro Manila mayors where he explained the national government’s vaccine plans.“That’s when they said we have to move quickly because it’s approved by the UK and they need to talk with Mayor because a certain number of doses is available for allocation for QC,” Juico said.This level of involvement of local governments was nowhere to be found in Galvez’s initial November 3 vaccine plan.",2.0,0.7910000085830688,"astrazeneca, pfizer, ph, deal, sign, receive, dose, duterte, trial, roque","['mayor', 'secure', 'deal']",0.34,0.0,0.455,0.545,0.6,Positive

Only 19% of Filipinos say they are willing to have themselves vaccinated
While the Philippines awaits the arrival of coronavirus vaccines necessary to tame the pandemic, a survey of the Octa Research Group showed a great number of Filipinos are still unwilling to have themselves vaccinated against the disease.The survey, conducted from January 26 to February 1, 2021, showed that if a safe and effective vaccine were available during the polling period, the greatest number of respondents at 46% said, “I will not have myself vaccinated.”The survey released on Wednesday night, February 24, also found that only 19% of respondents said they would have themselves vaccinated, while 35% said ""can't say"" if they will have themselves vaccinated.The Octa team based findings on face-to-face interviews with 1,200 Filipinos aged 18 years old and above. It has a 95% confidence level with a ±3% margin of error.Safety top concern
Among those unwilling to get vaccinated, the survey found the respondents' top 3 reasons for refusing a vaccine were the following:“Not sure if it is safe” (73%)

Along with this, concern about vaccine effectiveness was highest in the Visayas (46%), followed by Metro Manila (34%), Mindanao (27%), and Balance Luzon (21%).
Aside from this, 6% of survey respondents said they would not have themselves vaccinated as the vaccine “might not be free,” while another 6% said they would not get vaccinated because it “might be costly or expensive.”The survey found class D (74%) and E (73%) were more concerned with the safety of vaccines compared to class ABC (46%). It was the reverse for concern over efficacy of vaccines with class ABC (33%) reporting the highest concern about this as compared to class D (28%) and E (29%).For respondents who would reject a vaccine, disapproval was highest among class D, with 46% of the respondents saying they would not have themselves vaccinated. This was followed by class ABC at 45% and class E at 44%.Balance Luzon and the Visayas also recorded the highest percentage of those unwilling to get a vaccine at 47% each, followed by Metro Manila and Mindanao at 43% each.Vaccine acceptance was highest among class ABC and E (23% each), while class D was slightly lower at (18%).
Of the 35% of respondents undecided about the vaccine, uncertainty was highest in Balance Luzon (39%), while Metro Manila, the Visayas, and Mindanao were “almost at par” at 31%, 33%, and 32%, respectively. Among those undecided, 32% were from class ABC, 36% from class D, and 33% from class E.
Low trust in China vaccines
The Octa survey found only 1 in 10 or 15% Filipinos trusted vaccines coming from China, while 4 in 10 (41%) trusted those coming from the United States.In between these, 25% said they trusted vaccines coming from the United Kingdom, followed by 20% from Russia, and 17% if coming from India.The 5 countries cover a portfolio of at least 7 vaccine companies the Philippines has been in advanced negotiations with to purchase vaccines.

""As long as they get approval and we tell them what we need, they're ready to supply it,"" said Romualdez on Monday, November 9. A video of his remarks were shown to the Malacañang Press Corps on Tuesday.
The Philippines and other countries, however, may have to wait a little longer as Pfizer is prioritizing the United States for its vaccine production this year.
""Of course, their production this year, the United States will go first because they need 100 million vaccine [doses],"" said Romualdez in Filipino.
The ambassador pegged the cost of the Pfizer vaccine at $5 a shot, or around P240 a shot.
The US government had ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine for $1.95 billion, which puts the price per dose at $19.50.
Pfizer, said Romualdez, was the first American pharmaceutical firm to get in touch with him. He had been contact with other companies like Moderna ""3 to 4 months ago"" and these talks were supposedly the fruit of discussions between Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last April.
When will it arrive in the Philippines?
Romualdez estimates that, if all is smooth-sailing, the Pfizer vaccine could get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within the year and Philippine FDA approval early next year.
This could then mean an initial batch of the Pfizer vaccine arriving in the Philippines ""by early next year"" or ""first quarter"" of next year.
Romualdez said Pfizer has not asked for any ""downpayment"" but only a ""purchase order"" signifying the Philippine government's commitment to buy a certain amount of vaccine doses.
Another way a supply of the Pfizer vaccine could reach the country is through the Philippine private sector. Romualdez said Filipino businessmen have expressed willingness to pay for the vaccines so they can provide these to their employees.
Duterte's economic managers are targeting a fund of P20 billion to be used to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, likely from a variety of suppliers.
This fund will come from a loan to be provided by the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government financial institutions. The loan will be given to the Philippine International Trading Corp, which has been authorized to purchase vaccines for the government.
This fund is to shoulder only an ""initial"" batch of vaccines.
Apart from this, there's a P2.5-billion allocation for vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget.

Boosting demand
Throughout several Congressional hearings, lawmakers have raised concern over increasing vaccine hesitancy in the Philippines.A Pulse Asia survey conducted from November 23 to December 2, 2020 showed close to a majority of Filipinos or 47% are not willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 32% said they want to be immunized. The remaining 21% were still undecided.
The number of Filipinos willing to get vaccinated was lower than previous figures seen in a Social Weather Stations survey done in September 2020, where 66% said they were willing to receive a COVID-19 shot.A separate survey by the Octa Research Group also showed that 47% of respondents in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the pandemic in the Philippines, were still undecided on getting a COVID-19 vaccine.

The arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines is delayed due to the missing indemnification fund
The House of Representatives passed a bill setting a P500 million indemnification fund to shoulder the medical costs of Filipinos should they experience “adverse effects” after getting vaccinated for the coronavirus.
A total of 225 legislators voted yes to pass House Bill (HB) No. 8648 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 on 3rd and final reading on Monday, February 22, 4 days after President Rodrigo Duterte certified the measure as urgent.
No lawmakers voted against the bill, while 6 abstained from the vote.Duterte certifying HB 8648 as urgent allowed lawmakers to do away with the 3-day mandatory interval between its 2nd and 3rd reading approvals.
If passed into law, HB 8648 would create a COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund worth P500 million, which would augment the funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.
A claim for indemnification for serious adverse events must be filed within 5 years from the day of the person's COVID-19 vaccination.
The indemnification fund would be sourced from the 2021 national budget’s Contingent Fund, which are lump-sum appropriations that the government can tapped to finance unforeseen expenses.
The bill states the indemnity would be valid and available for release until it is fully expended or if the President terminates the program.
HB 8648's initial version did not contain a specific amount for the fund. But prior to the measure's 2nd reading approval on Monday, the plenary agreed to substitute HB 8648 with a new version that contains several amendments to include the P500-million indemnification fund and where it would be sourced.
The House plenary tackled other measures on the floor before approving HB 8648 on 3rd and final reading on Monday.
The Philippine government is on a race to create this indemnification fund since it is among the requirements to gain COVID-19 vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies and the COVAX global facility.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events. This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting emergency use approval for COVID-19 vaccines.Philippine pandemic officials initially announced that COVID-19 vaccines would already arrive by mid-February, but later on said delivery would be delayed due to a lack of an indemnification fund.
The Duterte government was supposedly informed of the indemnification requirement only during the latter phase of vaccine negotiations.MUST READ
Here’s why COVID-19 vaccines haven’t arrived in the Philippines yet
HB 8648 would also grant immunity to public officials and employees, contractors, volunteers, and private sector representatives – including vaccine manufacturers – from claims arising from the vaccine program. But they would not have any immunity if the claims would arise from ""willful misconduct and gross negligence.""
The bill likewise creates a vaccine passport program to serve as a record of the COVID-19 vaccinations received by an individual.
The final version of HB 8648 approved by the House is now closer to the pending Senate version, but some provisions are still either conflicting or are missing from the other chamber's version.
This means both houses would have to convene a bicameral conference committee to thresh out the conflicting provisions before the final version of the bill can be sent to Malacañang for Duterte’s signature.The House or the Senate may also opt to just adopt the version of the other chamber to skip the bicam level.
Fast-tracking vaccine purchase
Apart from creating an indemnification fund, HB 8648 also aims to help expedite the Duterte government’s COVID-19 vaccine procurement by exempting the process from public bidding and granting tax exemptions on the vaccines, supplies, and equipment to be procured.
The bill authorizes the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to engage in ""negotiated procurement under emergency cases"" for the COVID-19 vaccines.
Negotiated procurement would allow the DOH and the NTF to directly negotiate a contract with a capable supplier to speed up the process.
Local government units (LGUs) and private entities would also be allowed to buy COVID-19 vaccines or accept them as donations – but only by signing a multiparty agreement with the national government and the manufacturer concerned. This is the current policy being implemented by the NTF.
LGUs would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for up to 50% of their respective localities' population. But the bill said the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases may adjust this cap when there are enough supplies available. This power granted to LGUs would be valid retroactively starting from January 1, 2021.
The bill also mandates private companies that would be procuring COVID-19 vaccines to administer them for the ""sole and exclusive use of such companies."" This authority would apply retroactively starting November 1, 2020.
The bill likewise grants tax exemptions on the COVID-19 vaccines to be procured.It would also waive the Phase IV clinical trial requirement for COVID-19 medication and vaccines, but the drugs should still be recommended by the World Health Organization and/or other internationally recognized health agencies.Under the bill's multiparty deal scheme, LGUs and private entities would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines that have already been registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been issued emergency use authorization (EUA).
So far, only the vaccines created by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca have secured EUAs from the FDA.If passed into law, the bill's provisions would be valid during the state of calamity and public health emergency that was declared due to COVID-19 or until June 30, 2022 – unless Duterte lifts the state of emergency or extends it. – Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-02-22 19:07:00,"The Philippine government is on a race to create this indemnification fund since it is among the requirements to gain COVID-19 vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies and the COVAX global facility.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events.This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting emergency use approval for COVID-19 vaccines.Philippine pandemic officials initially announced that COVID-19 vaccines would already arrive by mid-February, but later on said delivery would be delayed due to a lack of an indemnification fund.The final version of HB 8648 approved by the House is now closer to the pending Senate version, but some provisions are still either conflicting or are missing from the other chamber's version.Fast-tracking vaccine purchase Apart from creating an indemnification fund, HB 8648 also aims to help expedite the Duterte government’s COVID-19 vaccine procurement by exempting the process from public bidding and granting tax exemptions on the vaccines, supplies, and equipment to be procured.The bill authorizes the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to engage in ""negotiated procurement under emergency cases"" for the COVID-19 vaccines.The bill likewise grants tax exemptions on the COVID-19 vaccines to be procured.It would also waive the Phase IV clinical trial requirement for COVID-19 medication and vaccines, but the drugs should still be recommended by the World Health Organization and/or other internationally recognized health agencies.Under the bill's multiparty deal scheme, LGUs and private entities would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines that have already been registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been issued emergency use authorization (EUA).So far, only the vaccines created by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca have secured EUAs from the FDA.If passed into law, the bill's provisions would be valid during the state of calamity and public health emergency that was declared due to COVID-19 or until June 30, 2022 – unless Duterte lifts the state of emergency or extends it.",0.0,0.8309000134468079,"get, ph, moderna, case, china, sinovac, filipino, duterte, dose, willing","['house', 'approve', 'indemnification', 'fund']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

The Food and Drug Adminisitration on Friday, January 8, said it has received an application for emergency use authorization of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute.
In an official statement, the FDA said it received the application for an emergency use authorization (EUA) on Thursday, January 7, one day after the firm expressed interest to secure one.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the submission had been pre-assessed and that its applicant was “instructed to comply with lacking documents.”
Domingo told Rappler that the 21-day period to review Gamaleya's EUA application will not start until it submits all necessary documentary requirements.

A doctor and spokesman for the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), the top COVID-19 referral hospital of pandemic epicenter Metro Manila, will be the first person to receive a vaccine through the government's vaccination program.
PGH director Dr Gerardo Legaspi announced this during a Malacañang press briefing on Thursday, February 11.
""We chose our spokesperson, Dr Jonas del Rosario, who since March 22 until today, has been speaking for us everyday,"" said Legaspi in Filipino.
Del Rosario himself contracted COVID-19 and lost both his parents to the respiratory disease.

Del Rosario will be the first to get the vaccine because PGH has been identified as the hospital that will get the first batch of vaccines. (See the list of priority hospitals here.)
The PGH head said that for hospital doctors and personnel, getting a COVID-19 vaccine shot was a ""symbolic gesture of the final phase of their personal fight against COVID.""
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque, referring to Del Rosario, said, ""You will be part of history as the first to be legally vaccinated with the anti-COVID-19 vaccine.""
But in the same press conference, Roque announced that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the restricted use by President Rodrigo Duterte’s security personnel of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines.
Malacañang has not disclosed details of this deal secured by the Presidential Security Group outside of the government’s official vaccination program. The official program puts military and uniformed personnel on the 5th tier of prioritization, after health frontliners, senior citizens, and persons with comorbidities.
Doctors, hospital workers 'excited' to get vaccinated
PGH doctors and staff are in a state of ""excitement"" over the prospect of getting their first vaccine shot this month, said Legaspi.
At the moment, however, there is no certainty which vaccine they will get. The 117,000 Pfizer vaccines that were supposed to arrive in mid-February will be delayed due to ""processing of documents"" with the COVAX Facility and World Health Organization, said testing czar Vince Dizon in the same press conference.
Despite this ""slight"" delay, the government still expects the Pfizer doses to start arriving within the month of February, said Dizon.
Meanwhile, some 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines are confirmed to arrive on February 23. These doses are a donation from the Chinese government, said Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque.
Still, Legaspi said he is confident that PGH doctors would be willing to take any vaccine as long as it had emergency use approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration.
The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have this approval, but Sinovac so far does not. The Chinese firm applied for an EUA last January 13.
Around 93% of over 5,000 PGH health workers conveyed their wish to be vaccinated, based on a pre-registration survey conducted by the public hospital.

While President Rodrigo Duterte stokes expectations of normalcy 'by December,' experts say even the arrival of a vaccine won't assure this immediately
An infectious disease expert working for the government estimates that the earliest time the Philippines would approve a COVID-19 vaccine for distribution is in the second quarter of 2021 or the months of April to June.
Dr Jaime Montoya, executive director of the Philippine Council for Health Research Development, said this projection takes into consideration the time it will take to conclude crucial Phase 3 trials and the approval process of food and drug administrations.
""My estimate is that it will be available in the Philippines, second quarter of next year,"" he said in a Rappler Talk interview on Friday, September 18.
Dr Melvin Sanicas, a Filipino vaccine expert based in Switzerland, said Montoya's estimate is ""reasonable"" but that it's a ""best-case scenario.""
Montoya's estimated timeline is broken down as follows:
November or December 2020 - Earliest conclusion of Phase 3 trials of any of the 9 most advanced vaccine candidates
January to March 2021 - Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) of the countries where the vaccine candidates are developed approve the vaccine for distribution, based on their assessment of Phase 3 trials.
April to June 2021 - The Philippines' FDA approves a vaccine for local distribution.
This timeline is hinged on many things going right.
The assumption is that Phase 3 trials will run smoothly, which is not always the case. Trials for the vaccine being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, for example, were paused when one of the volunteers experienced an illness. Because the illness turned out to be unrelated to the vaccine, the trials were resumed. But hiccups like this, or even bigger obstacles, can still threaten the progress of Phase 3 trials of all vaccines in the works.
Phase 3 trials are a crucial stage that involves testing thousands of people and comparing results with volunteers given a placebo. This determines if the vaccine is effective in protecting against SARS-CoV-2, and can reveal evidence of other possible side effects that may have been unseen in earlier studies.If a vaccine's Phase 3 trials go well, the results would still have to be assessed by FDAs of its home country and countries that want to distribute the vaccine domestically, like the Philippines.
Montoya said that it's possible for Phase 3 trial data to be submitted to both FDAs simultaneously but this process could lengthen the time it will take for the Philippine FDA to approve the vaccine for distribution. If the home country's FDA were to approve it first, which Montoya estimates could take a month, the Philippines' FDA's assessment would be aided by the approval of the home country's FDA.
Managing expectations set by Duterte
The more realistic expectation of a vaccine approval in the Philippines by the middle of 2021 is in stark contrast to the remarks of President Rodrigo Duterte that Filipinos need only wait until December for a vaccine.""I promise you, by the grace of God, I hope by December we would be back to normal.... Hintayin lang ho ninyo by December kung makatiis kayo (Just wait for December, if you can stand it),"" he said on July 31.
A month later, Duterte claimed that certain vaccines are to be ""distributed worldwide by September, October"" of 2020, again setting expectations.
""When the President said that the vacines are available, he's actually correct. It will be available maybe in their home countriesbut it's unlikely to be available in other countries like the Philippines because, as I said, it will also take time for them to submit their applications to our FDA and for FDA to review it before it can issue an approval for the said vaccine,"" said Montoya.
Duterte has pinned his hopes on 3 China-developed vaccine candidates, Russia's Sputnik V, and the vaccine candidates from US companies Moderna and Pfizer, and UK-Swedish company AstraZeneca.
Consistent with his geopolitical stance, he's given more praise to China and Russia for their assurances that the Philippines would get some level of ""priority"" access to their vaccines.
But he has slammed ""Western"" companies, likely referring to the US and European companies, for supposedly demanding a ""reservation fee"" which Duterte refuses to pay.
Montoya said this fee likely refers to Advance Market Commitment (AMC), which pharmaceutical companies usually ask from governments or other buyers, not just as advance payment but to boost its funding for vaccine development.
Ironically, the Philippines has already agreed to contribute to the AMC being collated by the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility. The Duterte administration is ready to cough up P1.5 billion for the program which ensures that the Philippines and other participating countries will get 20% of their needed vaccine supply from a manufacturer.
Upcoming hurdles: Securing supply and distribution
But even with Philippine FDA approval of a vaccine, there's still the challenge of securing a supply of the vaccine, and then distributing it efficiently to Filipinos.
Montoya said that through the COVAX Facility, the Philippines is assured at least of 20% of its vaccine needs, which could mean two doses of a vaccine for around 10 million people. This is if the Philippines' vaccine needs amount to immunization of 60% of its population, the Department of Health threshold for herd immunity.
But the private sector could move independently of the government and secure its own supply of an FDA-approved vaccine. This means that Filipinos who can afford to can buy a vaccine from their doctor even ahead of the free immunization by the government, which would likely cover only health workers and the poorest Filipinos anyway.
Let's say a vaccine does reach a good number of Filipinos. That doesn't mean health measures like mask-wearing and social distancing will be lifted.
The government will have to see the effects of the vaccine and a significant decrease in the number of infected.

The shortfall comes despite President Rodrigo Duterte's repeated claims that a vaccine is the 'only salvation' from the pandemic
As experts around the world race to find an effective COVID-19 vaccine, the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) said it lacked some P10 billion needed to procure enough doses for the identified priority groups.
At the DOH’s regular press briefing on Monday, October 19, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the initial P2.5 billion allocated for vaccines in the proposed 2021 budget would not cover procurement needed to vaccinate an initial target of 20% of the Philippines’ population.Citing estimated costs computed by the agency, Vergeire said the DOH would need roughly P12.1 billion to purchase doses needed to inoculate priority populations which include health workers and indigent Filipinos.
Vergeire said the amount was based on prospective prices for potential vaccines being marketed, most of which may require two doses.“It totaled to P12.1 billion so we lack about P10 billion in that budget,” Vergeire told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino.Vergeire had made the statement after referring to the lack of funds raised by Marikina City 2nd District Representative Stella Quimbo. She earlier expressed dismay over the P2.5 billion allocation, warning it would cover only 3.9 million of the targeted 20 million to be vaccinated.Why does this matter?
The lack of funds needed to procure enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine highlights the skewed priorities of the government’s pandemic recovery budget.While the country continues to record an increase in cases, the government has earmarked only some P90 billion for coronavirus efforts out of the proposed P4.5 trillion of the 2021 budget.The DOH’s shortfall of about P10 billion also comes as President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly touted a COVID-19 vaccine as the “only salvation” from the pandemic.MUST READ

""Any substance that will effectively and safely protect people is considered halal, especially if it is the only viable option at present,"" said Saidamen Pangarungan, secretary of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos, in a statement signed by 7 other Islamic leaders.

He said Muslim leaders in the United Kingdom, on the other hand, have issued a favorable fatwa or ruling on these. This fatwa, according to him, states: ""The UK government has confirmed that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any components of animal origin.""
Pangarungan said Pfizer also claims ""that all of their vaccine's components are either plant-based or are synthetic."" Like Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna ""have also stated that their vaccines do not use gelatin or pork products.""
In neighboring Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, Muslim leaders recently certified the Chinese vaccine CoronaVac, too, as halal.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire gives the assurance amid questions on whether the Philippines can procure the vaccine of US company Moderna, which did not hold clinical trials in the country
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Wednesday, November 18, assured the public that the Philippine government can still procure COVID-19 vaccines from companies like Moderna that did not hold clinical trials in the country.
Vergeire gave the assurance during a virtual press briefing, when she was asked whether the absence of local clinical trials of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine would have any implication on the government's vaccine procurement plan.
""Although, of course, that is the ideal. But if they do not intend, hindi 'yan makaka-stop sa gobyerno para makapag-procure tayo (it won't stop the government to procure) as long as they [follow] the regulatory process at makikita po natin ang mga naging epekto ng kanilang (and we can see the effects [or results] of their] phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3,"" Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing.

Moderna announced on Monday that its experimental vaccine against COVID-19 was almost 95% effective, marking a second major breakthrough in the quest to end the pandemic.
Moderna released early results from a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants, days after American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced that said their vaccine was 90% effective.

Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval in the US and around the world within weeks, and said it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect human health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr, who is also the National Task Force Chief Implementer, said on November 9 that supplies of a COVID-19 vaccine will most likely arrive in the Philippines by the end of 2021 or in early 2022.
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier said that his goal is for his government to shoulder COVID-19 vaccination for each Filipino, but only P2.5 billion was allocated for COVID-19 vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)

(UPDATED) The Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, East Avenue Medical Center, and Dr Jose N Rodriguez Hospital specifically will receive doses of the Pfizer vaccine
When a COVID-19 vaccine finally arrives in the Philippines, initial doses will be prioritized for health workers working in hospitals treating coronavirus patients.Vaccine czar Carlito Gavlez Jr said hospital workers in high-risk geographical areas would be among the first to be vaccinated against the disease since it was necessary to ensure essential health services continued while the pandemic was still ongoing.“Our hospitals will be first,” Galvez said when asked by Senator Nancy Binay where first doses of a vaccine will go.
Which vaccine will be given?
On February 3, Galvez listed the Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, East Avenue Medical Center, and Dr Jose N Rodriguez Hospital specifically will receive 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine supplied by the COVAX facility.
After these hospitals located in Metro Manila – the epicenter of the pandemic in the Philippines – COVID-19 referral hospitals in Cebu City and Davao City will follow.
Another 5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine are expected to arrive in the first half of 2021.
Considering the status of negotiations and regulatory requirements, Galvez earlier said the first vaccines that could arrive in the Philippines include those being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, Sinovac, or AstraZeneca.
Among these options, Galvez said Pfizer’s vaccine may be the first to arrive by the end of February through allocations from the GAVI COVAX facility. COVAX officials are currently finalizing a list of low-income countries to be given doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for an early rollout.Galvez said a specific amount of doses to arrive were not yet available as arrangements were still being finalized, though shipments may contain some 50,000 doses for 25,000 health workers.
Unlike other vaccines being eyed by the government, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have so far secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Pfizer vaccine was the first to be granted emergency approval after the FDA said its review process determined the Pfizer vaccine with an efficacy of 95% met all conditions for an EUA and that that the “benefit of using the vaccine outweighs its known and potential risks.”

As for Sinovac, Galvez said the government signed a term sheet that saw the company commit to supply with country with 25 million doses, though this will be contingent on whether it secured FDA emergency approval.
Without clearance from the FDA, Sinovac cannot be used in the Philippines. The company earlier submitted an application for an EUA, but FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the agency was waiting for phase 3 trial results before moving on to a full review.

This included Orca, Royal Cargo, Maersk, LBC, Metro Pacific, and Zuellig Pharma Corporation, among others.

The Philippines is preparing to order enough coronavirus vaccines for 92 million doses, 20 million more than its vaccination program target, in anticipation of delays and other complications, said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III.
He gave this figure in a report to President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 1, at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse during a meeting with other Cabinet members.
""We have negotiated for 92 million because we read in the newspapers about slippage, delays in delivery. There's delays in Europe, there's delays in the US, so to be safe we are negotiating more than what we need of 70 million,"" said Dominguez.
""We really expect delays but delay is not our fault because we have the money and we are ready, the delay is in the manufacturing,"" he continued.
The government and private sector are already in negotiations to bring the Philippines' total vaccine orders to 178 million doses, said Dominguez. Since most COVID-19 vaccines come in two doses, these would be enough for 89 million Filipinos.
Funding for vaccines
As it stands, the country has locked in some 146 million doses of vaccines – 40 million from the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility and some 106 million to 108 million from direct arrangements with various pharmaceutical firms.
Dominguez said the deals with firms will be paid for using loans from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, cumulatively worth $1.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the Philippines paid $84 million to participate in the COVAX scheme, said Dominguez.

The Philippines has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year
The Philippines will let thousands of its healthcare workers, mostly nurses, take up jobs in Britain and Germany if the two countries agree to donate much-needed coronavirus vaccines, a senior official said on Tuesday, February 23.
The Philippines, which has among Asia's highest number of coronavirus cases, has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year.
Alice Visperas, director of the labor ministry's international affairs bureau, said the Philippines was open to lifting the cap in exchange for vaccines from Britain and Germany, which it would use to inoculate outbound workers and hundreds of thousands of Filipino repatriates.
Nurses are among the millions of Filipinos who work overseas, providing in excess of $30 billion a year in remittances vital to the country's economy.
""We are considering the request to lift the deployment cap, subject to agreement,"" Visperas told Reuters.
Britain is grappling with the world's sixth-highest coronavirus death toll and one of the worst economic hits from the pandemic, while Germany has the 10th most infections globally.
While the two countries have inoculated a combined 23 million people, the Philippines has yet to start its campaign to immunize 70 million adults, or two-thirds of its 108 million people. It expects to receive its first batch of vaccines this week, donated by China.
The Philippines wants to secure 148 million doses of vaccines altogether.
The British embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while calls to Germany's mission went unanswered.

A timeline shared by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III shows how a mix of red tape and unfamiliarity with new vaccine technology slowed down the process of securing a purchase deal long before it could even start
From the early days of the pandemic, President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly touted the need for a vaccine to salvage the country from COVID-19.Several of the Chief Executive’s speeches have been peppered with statements on the much-needed relief a vaccine would bring to the economy, along with promises to inoculate the entire population for free.But new details shared by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III showed it took the Duterte administration about 4 to 5 months to sign a confidentiality data agreement (CDA) that would cover negotiations with vaccine developer Pfizer, raising questions about whether government officials moved fast enough to secure for the country the scarce supply.From when Pfizer officials approached the Philippine government in late June to start discussions on its vaccine candidates, it was only in late October, or 4 months after, that the CDA, a preliminary document, was signed. With other government officials like vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, the timeline stretched further to November when a CDA was finalized.Duque detailed the timeline of critical dates in the government’s dealings with Pfizer officials in response to allegations that he bungled a deal to secure the vaccine supplies by January.The health secretary found himself on the defense after Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr posted a cryptic tweet that an offer brokered by him, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would have locked in 10 million doses of the vaccine by as early as January 2021 “but that somebody dropped the ball.”“I have the chronology of events so that this is all documented. So there is no such thing as 'I did not act quick enough,'” Duque said in an interview on ANC Headstart on Thursday, December 17.MUST READ
Locsin shares foiled plan to secure 10M Pfizer vaccine doses by January
Red tape
What Duque’s timeline does show is how a mix of bureaucratic red tape, coupled with the uncertainty of a new vaccine, hampered the process of negotiating a purchase deal long before it could even start.In the case of a CDA – a preliminary document that would allow scientists to review Pfizer’s vaccine development data – signing this would be the first step in opening negotiations on the possible securement of doses.
Yetgovernment agencies passed the buck in signing a CDA on behalf of the Philippine government.First, from the DOH, Duque said an inter-agency task force resolution mandated that Pfizer’s overview on its vaccines should be given to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development as the lead agency in vaccine assessment.This differed from the preference of Pfizer, which initially wanted the Office of the President to sign the CDA on behalf of the government. It would take another month for the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) to designate the DOH as signatory.While the period for signing a CDA varies for the parties involved and terms being discussed, the global race to secure limited vaccine supplies has underscored the need not just for money, but agility from governments to move on locking down purchase deals. In a pandemic where hundreds may become ill or die in a single day, time is a precious resource.
How much of a factor was red tape in the weeks it took the government to sign a CDA with Pfizer? Duque was evasive, saying a new vaccine should afford the government some “allowance.”
“You have to give allowances to the fact that, I for one, this is my first time to have signed a CDA. So I have to be very, very cautious in what I am signing to ensure the government’s interest is first and foremost protected. That there are no onerous provisions,” Duque said.Asked why the OES, on behalf of the OP, passed on the responsibly to the DOH, Duque said the decision was also fueled by caution.“It was his judgment that because (a) vaccine is health-related, it was directly aligned to the mandate of the DOH. So that reason is well grounded,” he said.On the other hand, the health secretary said the process for evaluating vaccines was also revised in the context of the pandemic.Whereas the DOH was usually the only agency that assessed vaccines to be used in the Philippines, the inter-agency task force agreed the DOST would lead reviews through an expert panel focused on the scientific assessment of a COVID-19 vaccine.The arrangement, though well-intended, exposed how added layers of screening could prove detrimental if not optimized for a highly competitive vaccine like Pfizer and BioNTech’s.“Medyo talagang nung una, nagkakaproblema kasi (At the start, this was a problem because) if we follow the process, dapat nga 'yan (that should be) DOST, based on the IATF. It was Pfizer that wanted the Office of the President,” Duque said.MUST READ
TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Balancing act
This battle against time had to contend with the uncertainty over a new vaccine.As a public official, Duque said protocols must be followed and that “we cannot just be buying a vaccine like chocolate.” Further, as a medical professional, Duque said his principle was to remain prudent. “My overriding principle in my practice of medicine is always to err on the side of caution,” he said.For Duque, another factor that influenced his actions was the memory of the Dengvaxia scandal that tanked child immunization rates in the Philippines. The aftermath took its toll on children as the Philippines experienced a measles and polio outbreak it continues to address until today.
“There are too many unknowns and that’s why I said earlier, my overriding principle is, we have to be cautious with the health and lives of our people. We have long experience with different vaccines and we don’t want a repeat of very costly lessons we experienced in the past with some of the vaccines,” he said.The following key dates, as enumerated by Duque, detail this process:(We have included all dates mentioned, along with Duque’s description of events that took place on specific dates.)
June 24, 2020 -Pfizer sends an overview of its candidate vaccine development and manufacturing program to the Philippine government.June 29, 2020 - DOH, through its pharmaceutical division, refers the proposal to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD) as the lead agency in the management of vaccine development for COVID-19 response.August 6 - DOH sends a letter to Pfizer reiterating that its overview should be given to the DOST.August 7 - A meeting is held between Pfizer and DOH officials to discuss the use of its mRNA or messenger RNA technology in the company’s potential COVID-19 vaccine.Duque said that this meeting is where he raised many questions on the use of mRNA vaccines and whether or not these have been deployed in different countries. “And they said yes for HIV-AIDS and that’s about it. There has been no experience; DOH neither has experience in these long years of its immunization program, we never had this kind of technology,” he said.August 11 - Pfizer sends a draft CDA to the DOH.Duque said the CDA was initially meant to be signed by the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) on behalf of all government agencies.This arrangement would have eliminated the need for multiple government agencies to sign their own CDA with Pfizer. In a recent forum, the DOH said that they were trying to streamline the current setup which saw different agencies each having their own CDAs.August 26 - DOH re-endorses to Pfizer comments from “relevant technical offices” in the Philippine government.Duque said he cannot disclose details of the agreement or its provisions as he is bound by the CDA.
September 4 - Pfizer meets with key DOH and DOST officials, as well as Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to provide updates on their vaccine development.At this time, Duque said Pfizer explained it had two candidates qualified in terms of a safety and efficacy profile after Phase 1 and 2 trials.He also said this is when the company disclosed it had the potential supply of 100 million doses by the end of 2020, though this would be subject to regulatory approval. The company added it had a projected production of 1.3 billion doses by 2021, he added.Duque claimed 10 million doses were said to be set aside for the world market “outside of those that were given to the originating countries like the US,” in effect, disputing Locsin’s claim that the amount was offered specifically to the Philippines.Aside from this, Duque said the company was not interested in conducting Phase 3 trials– something the country preferred so that it could clear the vaccine for “ethnic diversity.” Researchers often test medicines on diverse populations as not all race and ethnic groups will respond the same way to medicines and potential side effects.On Friday, December 16, Locsin maintained an offer from the US had been made on Pfizer's vaccine but that it has since gone to Singapore.
September 11 - Pfizer receives the DOH’s comments on the CDADuque said there was a back and forth between the government and Pfizer officials on certain provisions that were supposedly “one-sided.”“This is not as simple as drafting a document for a medicine or vaccine that you’ve used in the past,” he said in Filipino.September 14 - Duque receives a revised draft CDA with revisions from the office of the deputy executive secretary. He says he also forwarded a summary of revisions from Pfizer and the DOH, among others.September 17 - The DOH sends a letter to the OES on the CDA. Reviews take place over the next few days.
September 24 - Pfizer sends an email to the DOH, saying it had been advised by the Office of the President, through the office of the executive secretary, that the DOH will be the signatory to the CDA. The company also requests for a coordination meeting. “So we met immediately,” Duque said.September 25 - The DOH responds to hold a meeting with Pfizer.Duque said this was needed since Pfizer initially wanted the President’s office to sign the CDA.“Hindi nga ako pupuwede mag-sign (I really cannot sign) for the national government. I can only sign for the DOH. And that is why it is small wonder that DOST also signed in November a separate CDA with Pfizer. Even Secretary Galvez signed a separate CDA with Pfizer also in November,” Duque said on Thursday.October 20 - Duque signs the CDA with Pfizer.According to him, Pfizer agreed that the DOH could sign on behalf of the government, on the condition that it would sign separate CDAs with different agencies as needed.Significant deal
While negotiations are ongoing between Pfizer officials and the Philippine government, what may have been a possible delay in signing necessary documents could prove costly for Filipinos.
Though Pfizer’s vaccine possessed a logistical headache for the Philippines, it has a strategic position in attaining emergency authorization from the FDA.For one, the US FDA has issued its own emergency authorization for the vaccine – a major factor and requirement to attaining a similar emergency clearance from the Philippines. This is buoyed by several clearances that regulatory agencies in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom have granted the company.Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was also the first to show promising results of 95% efficacy. This was announced on November 18.
Meanwhile, for all of the health secretary's uncertainty on the vaccine, a CDA could have covered in part, if not full, a review of scientific and trial data that would shed light on the way the vaccine worked. Duque mentioned that the agreement was to facilitate the sharing of data.

For now, Filipinos must wait as no details on the specific number of doses to be purchased by the government have been disclosed. On how soon these may be deployed, Galvez said Pfizer's vaccine may arrive in the country by the 3rd quarter of 2021 at the earliest, along with the bulk of other vaccines eyed by the Philippines.On Thursday, December 17, Senator Francis Pangilinan said that if it can be established that a government official ""inexcusably"" failed to act, then he may be sued under Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-graft law.Specifically, Section 3(e) of RA 3019 listed corrupt actions to include:
“Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.”

5 nagging questions the Duterte gov’t has not answered on its use of unregistered vaccines
What Sinopharm trials?
In an official statement on Friday, the DOH and FDA responded to reports “purporting that the DOH did not act on documents for the participation of the Philippines in the clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Sinopharm.”
The DOH denied this, citing an inter-agency task force (IATF) resolution issued last May 2020, where it had approved Sinopharm’s participation in trials in the Philippines.While the IATF approved the Department of Science and Technology’s (DOST) recommendation to collaborate with Sinopharm for trials, part of this included securing the FDA’s approval for trials.The DOST also belied accusations the Philippine government did not take necessary steps to push trials forward, saying it responded to Sinopharm’s proposals for collaboration.The DOST said Sinopharm proposed cooperation could take place in two ways. First, through trials that the Philippines would fund or through the Philippine government recognizing of authorization for Sinopharm’s vaccine granted by China’s regulatory authorities.On the first proposal, the DOST said the Philippines “only funds trials under the WHO (World Health Organization) Solidarity Trial.” The DOST, meanwhile, did not mention if it commented on Sinopharm’s second proposal. But by practice and FDA guidelines on granting emergency authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, China’s FDA is not among worldwide regulatory authorities the Philippines included for “reliance or recognition” pathways when granting approval for vaccines.The use of “reliance and recognition pathways” help to speed approval of medical goods by allowing the FDA to cooperate with trusted authorities– like their counterparts in the United States, Japan, Australia, European Union, Singapore, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the World Health Organization, among others.The DOST said “Sinopharm never responded to this letter” where it replied to its proposals.In October 2020, the Chinese firm informed the Philippines it was no longer interested in conducting trials, saying it opted to supply doses of the vaccine to the country.The FDA added that as of January 1, 2021, Sinopharm has not submitted any application for clinical trials nor emergency use authorization (EUA) of their vaccine in the Philippines. Only Pfizer has applied for an EUA in the Philippines.

The loan terms and interest rate have not been disclosed yet, as the ADB is still coordinating the deal with the Department of Finance and the Department of Health. Bird, however, noted that the loan will be concessional or will have a long grace period and low interest rate.
Bird added that the amount is ""above and beyond"" the $9.4-billion (P452-billion) sovereign lending program for the Philippines, which covers mostly infrastructure projects.
Criteria
The ADB said it will only fund vaccines that have satisfied any of the following criteria:Selected for procurement via COVAX on behalf of participating countriesPrequalified by the World Health Organization
Authorized by a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) for manufacture in an SRA country or the SRA has authorized its manufacture in a non-SRA country
The Philippine government would also submit a national vaccination plan, which safeguards against exclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups.
The latest developments on the financing that the government is tapping come as it lags in the race to get COVID-19 vaccines.
Indonesia has secured 338 million doses from 5 developers, while Malaysia has secured 14 million doses, most of which would come from Pfizer.
The Philippines' first stockpile of vaccines, 2.6 million doses worth around P700 million, were secured through the efforts of the private sector.
President Rodrigo Duterte and his team struggled to pay in advance for vaccines, supposedly due to the country's strict procurement laws. But even Duterte's officials, particularly his spokesperson Harry Roque, noted that international deals are exempted from such rules.
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III pointed to red tape coupled with the uncertainty of a new vaccine as factors hampering the process of negotiating a purchase deal. – Rappler.com",Rappler,2020-12-21 16:50:00,"The ADB says the Philippines may opt to increase its vaccine borrowings up to $500 million (P24.05 billion) from the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility Asian Development Bank (ADB) country director Kelly Bird on Monday, December 21, said the Philippine government asked for $325 million (P15.6 billion) for the purchase and logistical costs of COVID-19 vaccines.Bird said the Philippines may opt to increase its vaccine borrowings up to $500 million (P24.05 billion) from the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), which has a total allocation of $9 billion for ADB member countries.The loan terms and interest rate have not been disclosed yet, as the ADB is still coordinating the deal with the Department of Finance and the Department of Health.Bird, however, noted that the loan will be concessional or will have a long grace period and low interest rate.Bird added that the amount is ""above and beyond"" the $9.4-billion (P452-billion) sovereign lending program for the Philippines, which covers mostly infrastructure projects.Criteria The ADB said it will only fund vaccines that have satisfied any of the following criteria:Selected for procurement via COVAX on behalf of participating countriesPrequalified by the World Health Organization Authorized by a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) for manufacture in an SRA country or the SRA has authorized its manufacture in a non-SRA country The Philippine government would also submit a national vaccination plan, which safeguards against exclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups.Indonesia has secured 338 million doses from 5 developers, while Malaysia has secured 14 million doses, most of which would come from Pfizer.",4.0,0.7904000282287598,"vaccination, ph, get, galvez, duterte, first, dose, sinovac, health, supply","['ask', 'adb', 'buy']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

(1st UPDATE) Father Nicanor Austriaco’s assertion runs contrary to WHO’s position that 'there is no reason not to recommend its use,' even in countries where the South African variant was detected
The Philippines’ 17 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses ""will be ineffective"" – because they would supposedly require an additional shot per person – if the government cannot curb cases of the COVID-19 South African variant in the country, an expert warned on Wednesday, March 3.
In a virtual press briefing, Octa Research fellow and molecular biologist Father Nicanor Austriaco cited studies showing that the efficacy of the ""AstraZeneca vaccine against B1351 dramatically decreased from 70% to 10%.""""With 10% protection, basically, most people would still be able to get mild and moderate COVID-19,"" he said.
The study cited by Austriaco was disclosed by AstraZeneca itself. It had a small sample involving healthy young adults. (READ: AstraZeneca COVID shot less effective against South African variant – study)
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) of the World Health Organization (WHO) still recommends the use of AstraZeneca, including in countries where the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce its efficacy. It said the vaccine should be given in two doses with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks, and should also be used in people aged 65 and older.
Even in countries such as South Africa, where questions have been raised about the AstraZeneca vaccine's efficacy against a newly-emerged variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, ""there is no reason not to recommend its use,"" SAGE chair Alejandro Cravioto had said on February 10.
Since AstraZeneca vaccines come in two doses each, Austriaco said, “We would need three doses of the remaining vaccines because you'd need one booster shot just for the B1351 variant.”While he didn’t disclose it during the press conference, Austriaco is part of a team developing another vaccine. In an interview with CNN Philippines in early February, he said he would be in the United States to conduct experiments on a yeast-based oral vaccine against COVID-19.

Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque replied in the affirmative to reporters asking to clarify if Duterte's statements in a Super Typhoon Rolly (Goni) situationer meeting meant Galvez had been given the role.
""Pagbili ng bakuna, the negotiation, manufacture, production, or distribution, binigay ko 'yan kay Secretary Galvez,"" Duterte said during the meeting held at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse.

'Task group' on vaccine distribution
Last Thursday, October 29, the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) created a structure that would manage and distribute COVID-19 vaccines once they become available to the Philippines.
The vaccine task group is to be led by the Department of Health. It's not clear how Galvez's new role as ""vaccine czar"" affects this arrangement. (READ: What we know about the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccine plans)
In the same meeting, Duterte expressed his preference for ""only one line of authority come from the task force.""
Galvez already has a leadership role in the government's pandemic efforts, being chief implementer of the national action plan.
His role is distinct from Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who heads the National Task Force vs COVID-19 (NTF), and Duque who heads the policy-making IATF-EID.
The 57-year-old Galvez served as chief of the military from April to December 2018. After his retirement, Duterte appointed him Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process.
Apart from Galvez, there are 4 other ""czars"" in the Duterte government's COVID-19 response – testing czar Vince Dizon, treatment czar Leopoldo Vega, tracing czar Benjamin Magalong, and isolation czar Mark Villar.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, President Rodrigo Duterte said he has pleaded with Chinese President Xi Jinping to prioritize the Philippines when providing an effective vaccine that would cure COVID-19.Duterte disclosed this during his 5th State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 27, saying he “made a plea” to Xi 4 days ago.“Four days ago I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first – or if it's needed that we will have to buy it – that we will be granted credit so we can normalize as fast as possible,” Duterte said in his speech.Coronavirus cases have continued to increase in the Philippines with over 82,000 infected as of Monday.

(UPDATED) Donated? Smuggled? And ordered by whom? As burning questions on early COVID-19 vaccinations linger, Malacañang wants to insist the issue is ‘over’ while health experts express alarm on its unregulated use.
While millions of Filipinos wait to receive a COVID-19 shot, the latest pandemic violation came in secret doses of an unregistered vaccine used on top government officials and members of President Rodrigo Duterte’s close-in security.The unregulated vaccination violated laws that assured the public safety of medicines, bewildering the government’s own health officials and leaving medical experts alarmed over its impact on forthcoming immunization efforts seeking to end the public health emergency.After all, the success of vaccination programs, the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) pointed out, “hinged on mutual trust between the public and institutions.” It’s a lesson the Department of Health knows painfully well, after the tainted Dengvaxia immunization program left public health programs in pieces.But while the country still lacks an approved vaccine against the disease, this has not stopped other public officials from deciding on their own which vaccine to use and on whom – an authority reserved for regulatory and medical experts.It was no less than President Rodrigo Duterte who revealed the day after Christmas that vaccines were already given to some people in government.“Sabihin ko, marami na magpa-injection dito sa Sinopharm (I’ll say it, many here have been injected with Sinopharm)…. I have to be frank, I have to tell the truth,” Duterte claimed, leaving his men to make sense of the searing issue. Now faced with public backlash for the selective vaccinations, Malacañang would have the public just “accept” these took place. “Tapos na po ang usapan na 'yan (That issue is over),” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said.But the Palace’s attempts to end the issue failed to explain how the unregulated immunization efforts took place.Rappler lists 5 critical questions left unanswered by the Duterte government.Who received a vaccine?
Regulatory bodies across the world have granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines because these are still considered to be in the development phase. That means strict monitoring is needed to document all information on its use and watch out for possible side effects.Without details of who received a vaccine, health authorities cannot implement proper surveillance.
The President may have divulged that soldiers were among those who received a vaccine but it was Interior Secretary Eduardo Año who later detailed that those inoculated belonged to the Presidential Security Guard (PSG). The Armed Forces of the Philippines at first declined to name which unit the soldiers belonged to, but later confirmed that it was indeed the PSG.This prompted PSG Commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante to speak up on the matter, saying members of the President’s close-in security were given a vaccine as a necessary and “courageous” step that would assure Duterte’s safety.“We are in a state of war; a war against COVID-19. War compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. As such, PSG exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the Filipino people,” Durante said in an official statement.Año had also disclosed that at least one Cabinet official benefited from the early vaccination but declined to name the official out of “privacy.”As the Philippines faces the mammoth challenge of procuring scarce supply of vaccines, jabs given to these select individuals fall out of line in the government’s own target list of priority groups – the first of whom were frontline health workers tending to coronavirus patients.DUTERTE CABINET.

Did Duterte sanction the vaccination?
Malacañang has defended the issue by arguing that it was not unlawful for people to receive an unregistered vaccine. But what of those who brought the vaccines into the Philippines?The question over who ordered unapproved vaccines to be used will point to those who can be sanctioned for circumventing the government’s own rules. Unauthorized immunizations violate the Food and Drug Administration Act which prohibits the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, transfer, and use of unregistered health products, among others.What’s clear for now is that officials either “do not know,” have refused to name, or clashed on who directed the vaccination.
On December 28, the first Monday after Duterte opened the blistering issue, Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana said the vaccination of soldiers followed the chain of command.“Of course, our President is our commander-in-chief of the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines). I should say it's from the chain of command of the Armed Forces,” he told DWIZ when asked if the decision came from Malacañang or the AFP.But in a virtual press briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque threw it back to the military, saying the decision “must have been made” by them since vaccines would not reach soldiers without the go-signal of commanders.Overnight, statements would continue to change and take shape. Asked to comment on the Army’s remarks, Roque said he was not aware of what the Armed Forces claimed. “They must be privy to that information, I am not,” he said, adding he did not interfere with what could involve “national security.”
On the side of health officials, FDA Director General Enrique Domingo told media he was not aware of who made the decision to have soldiers vaccinated and that Health Secretary Francisco Duque III seemed to be in the dark too.“I spoke to Secretary (Duque), nagulat din po siya (he was also surprised),” Domingo said.The FDA chief was careful to answer questions that “speculated” on who was responsible, instead seeking to wait on more information from a probe the agency had launched. He doubted Duterte sanctioned the unregulated immunization, saying, “Hindi naman po siguro galing sa pangulo iyon ano” (That probably didn’t come from the President.)
The statement again changed when Durante said in an interview on ANC on Saturday, December 30, that the PSG did its own research on what vaccine to use for its unit. They did not ask permission from Duterte who was supposedly told only after the fact, he said.By December 30, Durante said he was taking ""full responsibility"" over the PSG's use of an unapproved vaccine, that it was done ""independently,"" and no one convinced them do it. ""We vaccinated ourselves. It's so easy,"" he said.

RTVM SCREENSHOT
Which vaccines were used and how were doses brought into the country?
Duterte cited Sinopharm in his speech where he revealed the early vaccinations, but details on this were left out by his officials as the issue unfolded over the next few days.Domingo said that among the questions FDA’s probe seeks to answer include exactly what vaccine was used as well as the current status of the immunization activities. The investigation on this would take a “few days,” he added.Durante did not want to cite what vaccine was used, nor the source it came from since this could threaten the government’s procurement efforts. He only described the shot as “one of the safest” and “very traditional.”But how did it enter the Philippines in the first place, without the knowledge of the FDA that would clear it?Bureau of Customs Assistant Commissioner and spokesperson Philip Vincent Maronilla said the agency was clueless as well. The vaccine used by Duterte’ security and top officials of the government, he added, had no official papers.Maronilla told DZBB that when Customs officials reviewed their records in “so far as vaccines brought in for the use of general public,” no instructions involving the matter had been given to them. He said if the vaccines are proven smuggled, officials involved could face administrative and civil cases.
According to Roque, the vaccines were given as a donation. He even categorized them as “tokens” and likened the extremely scarce item to a birthday cake that personnel from his office gave him, sidestepping a reporter's question if it could be considered corruption for receiving the valuable donation.
If this was so, who did it come from? “Hindi ko po alam (I don’t know), Roque said. “Kung ano po ang sinabi ng aking amo, iyon lang po (Whatever my boss has said, that's it). I cannot add, I cannot subtract.”If the vaccines were indeed given as a donation, Domingo said this still would have gone through the DOH’s Bureau of International Health Cooperation which coordinates with the FDA for the clearance of donated health products under normal circumstances. Government regulations likewise apply to official COVID-19 donations coming from foreign entities which undergo the verification process.Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the vaccines were indeed smuggled as it was unauthorized, but that it was “justified” since it is meant to protect the President. The defense chief said he did not know the source of the vaccines used and admitted he didn’t know how the smuggling issue “will be resolved” as the PSG violated FDA rules.
While Durante took the heat for the issue, he still did not disclose where or whom the doses were sourced from.

Why were health officials not consulted?
If the concern was to secure the President’s safety, was it enough to warrant bypassing the government’s own health officials?
The government’s own coronavirus task force formed a unique panel of vaccine experts under the Department of Science and Technology that was created specially to review potential COVID-19 vaccines.
The separate entity was supposed to provide an added layer of safety in evaluating vaccines developed during unprecedented circumstances, on top of an ad hoc group of experts at the FDA who were tapped as part of the process of issuing emergency use authorization.
Domingo said the DOH and the FDA – among the lead agencies in the vaccination efforts – had not been consulted on the use of a COVID-19 vaccine on PSG soldiers and top government officials.The agency was firm in its stand that the public should not be vaccinated yet because there are no registered vaccines subjected to FDA review.

FDA's balancing act: Probing unregistered vaccine used on soldiers, officials
How did it bypass FDA approval?
Even by Duterte’s own orders, a COVID-19 vaccine should have gone through proper regulatory processes before it could be used, let alone brought into the Philippines.The Chief Executive granted the FDA authority to issue special EUAs for the very purpose of ensuring timely access to safe COVID-19 medicines while the pandemic raged.Why the exception for a vaccine used by select officials?“I am as confused as you. I am also as bewildered because there is a process, there is a way for us to make sure that we can get the most amount of certainty when it comes to safety and efficacy of a vaccine,” Domingo said in an interview with ABS-CBN on December 28.In a separate briefing, he told reporters, “The fact is, there is no registered COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines at this time.”
If it was Sinopharm that was used, Roque downplayed the unknown risks, referring to China’s EUA for the vaccine and its use on hundreds of thousands outside traditional testing processes.Experts from HPAAC, the largest coalition of medical and health societies in the country, pointed out that an EUA from one country does not extend authority beyond its borders. Moreover, there is more to vaccines than simply receiving them.“Even if a vaccine is approved in other countries, its storage, transport, and distribution are complex procedures. Improper handling can damage vaccines and can render them useless,” the group said. “This is why distribution channels and processes need to be transparent and regulated.”
HPAAC counts among its member groups medical societies that earlier warned that the Philippines needed to recalibrate its response to the pandemic or see the country's health system overwhelmed. It counts some of the country's top medical experts and doctors as members.
What the law says
Each lapse that occurred in the unregulated vaccination of government workers raises the prospect that several laws have been violated.For the importation, distribution, and administration of an unregulated vaccine, the FDA Act of 2009 imposes a penalty of imprisonment and stiff fines that could reach millions of pesos.As it slipped pass health and Customs officials, those responsible for smuggling vaccines could face administrative and civil cases. The same goes for a “donation” of the coveted vaccine, which did not pass through proper government channels and may be subject to the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.On Monday, January 4, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra issued a written order directing the National Bureau of Investigation to probe the use of smuggled vaccines in the country.Guevarra did not zero in on the PSG but said it was important that laws on vaccine approval and administration were ""strictly observed for the benefit of everyone.""Aside from the FDA Act, Guevarra said the NBI is looking into possible violations of the Medical Practice Act of 1959 which holds liable individuals who “knowingly or willfully administer an unregistered vaccine.”While questions remain unanswered, among the casualties of the issue initially kept under wraps are frontliners and essential workers who have been told that they would be the first to receive the vaccine.The health department tried to assuage concerns.

PH to prioritize high-risk areas, sectors for COVID-19 vaccine rollout
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire vowed: “One thing I can say to the public, please do not worry. We will still follow the priority groups listed to receive the vaccine. Our priority to have healthcare workers be the first, the vulnerable groups, the frontliners – all of this will be followed when the vaccine that we procure and register arrives in the country.”
She asserted, “Our prioritization will not be changed or revised.” – Rappler.com",Rappler,2020-12-30 15:39:00,"While millions of Filipinos wait to receive a COVID-19 shot, the latest pandemic violation came in secret doses of an unregistered vaccine used on top government officials and members of President Rodrigo Duterte’s close-in security.The unregulated vaccination violated laws that assured the public safety of medicines, bewildering the government’s own health officials and leaving medical experts alarmed over its impact on forthcoming immunization efforts seeking to end the public health emergency.After all, the success of vaccination programs, the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) pointed out, “hinged on mutual trust between the public and institutions.” It’s a lesson the Department of Health knows painfully well, after the tainted Dengvaxia immunization program left public health programs in pieces.But while the country still lacks an approved vaccine against the disease, this has not stopped other public officials from deciding on their own which vaccine to use and on whom – an authority reserved for regulatory and medical experts.It was no less than President Rodrigo Duterte who revealed the day after Christmas that vaccines were already given to some people in government.“Sabihin ko, marami na magpa-injection dito sa Sinopharm (I’ll say it, many here have been injected with Sinopharm)….The Armed Forces of the Philippines at first declined to name which unit the soldiers belonged to, but later confirmed that it was indeed the PSG.This prompted PSG Commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante to speak up on the matter, saying members of the President’s close-in security were given a vaccine as a necessary and “courageous” step that would assure Duterte’s safety.“We are in a state of war; a war against COVID-19.“They must be privy to that information, I am not,” he said, adding he did not interfere with what could involve “national security.” On the side of health officials, FDA Director General Enrique Domingo told media he was not aware of who made the decision to have soldiers vaccinated and that Health Secretary Francisco Duque III seemed to be in the dark too.“I spoke to Secretary (Duque), nagulat din po siya (he was also surprised),” Domingo said.The FDA chief was careful to answer questions that “speculated” on who was responsible, instead seeking to wait on more information from a probe the agency had launched.If this was so, who did it come from?I cannot add, I cannot subtract.”If the vaccines were indeed given as a donation, Domingo said this still would have gone through the DOH’s Bureau of International Health Cooperation which coordinates with the FDA for the clearance of donated health products under normal circumstances.Domingo said the DOH and the FDA – among the lead agencies in the vaccination efforts – had not been consulted on the use of a COVID-19 vaccine on PSG soldiers and top government officials.The agency was firm in its stand that the public should not be vaccinated yet because there are no registered vaccines subjected to FDA review.I am also as bewildered because there is a process, there is a way for us to make sure that we can get the most amount of certainty when it comes to safety and efficacy of a vaccine,” Domingo said in an interview with ABS-CBN on December 28.In a separate briefing, he told reporters, “The fact is, there is no registered COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines at this time.” If it was Sinopharm that was used, Roque downplayed the unknown risks, referring to China’s EUA for the vaccine and its use on hundreds of thousands outside traditional testing processes.Experts from HPAAC, the largest coalition of medical and health societies in the country, pointed out that an EUA from one country does not extend authority beyond its borders.",5.0,0.8944000005722046,"city, worker, health, doh, get, trial, first, astrazeneca, sinovac, rollout","['nagging', 'question', 'duterte', 'gov', 'answer', 'use', 'unregistered']",-0.4019,0.31,0.69,0.0,0.0,Negative

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the national government will not tie down mayors and governors in choosing a particular COVID-19 vaccine for their constituents.
""I'm now addressing the mayors and governors, you can choose any vaccine you like to buy. Wala kaming pakialam kung ano ang pipiliin 'nyo (We don't care which one you'll choose),"" he said on Wednesday, January 13, during a meeting with pandemic task force officials at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse.
His promise comes amid successive announcements of cities signing deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca for hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses.
Duterte later on clarified that local governments would still have to choose from the COVID-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a national government agency.
""Maraming local government units who opted to go on their own. Sila ang magbili, may pera sila, and sila ang mamili ng kanilang vaccine.... And they insist to be given the freedom to choose because may pera sila,"" said Duterte.

He then said the national government is ""not forcing"" any local government to adopt the vaccines to be patronized by the national government.
Chinese vs Western vaccines?
While local governments had signed deals with AstraZeneca, a few like Davao City, led by Duterte's daughter Sara, are also in talks with Chinese firm Sinovac.

Duterte defended Chinese-made vaccines in the same meeting, saying they are ""as good"" as American- or European-made ones.
The Philippine leader has long expressed a preference for Chinese or Russian vaccines, with Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque even saying last Monday, January 11, that if Duterte had his way, he would get injected with both a Chinese and Russian vaccine.

The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 warns that allowing for such a setup could severely impact public health safety and lead to the inequitable rollout of vaccines in the Philippines
Several of the Philippines' top health experts on Thursday, February 11, opposed lawmakers' efforts to push for bills that would allow local government units (LGUs) to buy coronavirus vaccines directly from manufacturers.
The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) – the largest coalition of health groups in the country – warned that proposed measures seeking to grant LGUs this authority could severely impact the public health safety and rollout of vaccines in the country.It could also create unequal access to limited shots throughout the country, with prioritization of the coveted good defined by access to funds and the capacity to pay, instead of need based on exposure and risk to COVID-19.""This is not about money but justice – social justice,"" said Dr Aileen Espina, a public health and family medicine specialist, during a press conference on Thursday night.
Internal medicine specialist and epidemiologist Dr Antonio Dans, along with Dr Inday Dans, pediatrician and clinical epidemiologist, said the group was strongly opposed to the possible passage of Senate Bill No. 2042 filed by Senate Majority Leader Miguel Zubiri last February 8.
Dans appealed to lawmakers and Zubiri to reconsider the bill, saying it would impact the public's trust in the government's COVID-19 vaccination program.""This will impact public trust greatly, not just when it comes to effectiveness of vaccines but in their trust that no one will be left behind, people will be treated equally, and the country will move forward together,"" Dans said in Filipino.While the group focused on SB 2042, similar measures had been filed at the House of Representatives by Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez, House Minority Leader Stephen Paduano, as well as Quirino Representative Junie Cua.
The bigger picture
Lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have been pushing for measures that would allow LGUs and the private sector to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers, without the oversight of national government.
They argued that allowing for such purchase schemes would speed up access to vaccines in the country. This comes after they criticized the national government's supposed ""monopoly"" over purchase deals that hampered Filipinos' access to COVID-19 shots.
But health experts opposed such measures for 3 main reasons:First, that it would bypass the required recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC), which is mandated to review medical technology eyed for use in a public health program. The HTAC, created by the Universal Health Care Law, reviews the feasibility and cost-efficiency of health technology like vaccines for public use, as well as potential commercial or political conflicts of interest.
Second, it would lead to ""maldistribution"" of vaccines, where richer LGUs with the capacity to pay would get priority access to already limited vaccines, leaving poorer communities further behind.Third, patchwork purchasing of vaccines, as opposed to centralized purchase through the national government, would escalate vaccine prices ""because the country will lose the scale or volume that one buyer has.""
Dans said the HTAC's recommendation guaranteed public safety of vaccines as the group of independent scientists continuously reviewed vaccines to balance ""benefit, harm, and cost” that may shift quickly, ""even overnight,"" as more information on COVID-19 and vaccines were shared.
This recommendation is separate from the Food and Drug Administration's issuance of emergency approval, which focused only on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine.""Bypassing recommendations of this council will expose the people to the dangers of inappropriate technology, and may make local policy makers liable for wrong decisions,"" he said.Allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines on their own would also hamper goals of a vaccine program to reduce mortality and maintain healthcare capacity. They stressed that since supplies worldwide are limited, scarce shots should be given to those who need it most across the country: healthcare workers, elderly, and people with comorbidities.
Dans said: ""If there was no lack of vaccines, it would be acceptable, but with limited supplies, the scarce vaccines should be give to those who need it the most.... One problem of the pandemic is the poor are always shortchanged.""

Granting LGUs the authority to buy vaccines on their own could also threaten proper allocation of funds, as the HPAAC pointed out that nearly half of the cost of immunization programs is spent on actually implementing the rollout of vaccines.
With doses already severely limited worldwide and developed countries having access to majority of vaccines produced, the HPAAC said allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines directly from manufacturers may see the same scenario of unequal distribution take place locally.""We aggravate this inequity by doing the same thing locally – distributing geographically according to capacity to pay. When this happens, we all suffer, not just those whom we push to the end of the queue,"" the group said.Dans said the group had presented its position to lawmakers at the Senate, but that discussions indicated preference for the bill to be passed despite its possible negative impact on the country's COVID-19 vaccination program.What works now
The HPAAC appealed to lawmakers to keep the current scheme where LGUs and the private sector buy vaccines along with the national government, since this would assure equal distribution and continuous safety.This setup would also comply with the FDA's conditions for use under an emergency use authorization (EUA), which allows for its public use under strict conditions.
While the proposed bills in Congress mentioned LGUs could only buy vaccines that have been granted an EUA by the FDA, the HPAAC pointed out that an EUA was still different from securing full marketing authority necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allow its sale in the market.Current purchase schemes involving LGUs and the private sector take the form of tripartite deals where the national government, through the National Task Force against COVID-19, signs deals with vaccine manufacturers and either LGUs or business groups.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had told lawmakers during previous congressional hearings that this allowed for LGUs and the private sector to take part in vaccine procurement – something unique to the Philippines, as vaccine manufacturers have so far preferred to deal directly with national governments only.According to Galvez, tripartite deals allow the Philippines to meet this condition of vaccine companies which they observed with all countries, especially as supplies of vaccines remain severely limited.
Galvez had also earlier told senators that allowing LGUs and private groups to directly buy COVID-19 vaccines was not yet possible. This was because ""no company"" would engage in deals that did not involve national governments of other countries, which have only been granting emergency use approvals to COVID-19 vaccines. – Rappler.com",Rappler,2021-02-11 23:49:00,"The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 warns that allowing for such a setup could severely impact public health safety and lead to the inequitable rollout of vaccines in the Philippines Several of the Philippines' top health experts on Thursday, February 11, opposed lawmakers' efforts to push for bills that would allow local government units (LGUs) to buy coronavirus vaccines directly from manufacturers.The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) – the largest coalition of health groups in the country – warned that proposed measures seeking to grant LGUs this authority could severely impact the public health safety and rollout of vaccines in the country.It could also create unequal access to limited shots throughout the country, with prioritization of the coveted good defined by access to funds and the capacity to pay, instead of need based on exposure and risk to COVID-19.""This will impact public trust greatly, not just when it comes to effectiveness of vaccines but in their trust that no one will be left behind, people will be treated equally, and the country will move forward together,"" Dans said in Filipino.While the group focused on SB 2042, similar measures had been filed at the House of Representatives by Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez, House Minority Leader Stephen Paduano, as well as Quirino Representative Junie Cua.But health experts opposed such measures for 3 main reasons:First, that it would bypass the required recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC), which is mandated to review medical technology eyed for use in a public health program.With doses already severely limited worldwide and developed countries having access to majority of vaccines produced, the HPAAC said allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines directly from manufacturers may see the same scenario of unequal distribution take place locally.When this happens, we all suffer, not just those whom we push to the end of the queue,"" the group said.Dans said the group had presented its position to lawmakers at the Senate, but that discussions indicated preference for the bill to be passed despite its possible negative impact on the country's COVID-19 vaccination program.What works now The HPAAC appealed to lawmakers to keep the current scheme where LGUs and the private sector buy vaccines along with the national government, since this would assure equal distribution and continuous safety.This setup would also comply with the FDA's conditions for use under an emergency use authorization (EUA), which allows for its public use under strict conditions.While the proposed bills in Congress mentioned LGUs could only buy vaccines that have been granted an EUA by the FDA, the HPAAC pointed out that an EUA was still different from securing full marketing authority necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allow its sale in the market.Current purchase schemes involving LGUs and the private sector take the form of tripartite deals where the national government, through the National Task Force against COVID-19, signs deals with vaccine manufacturers and either LGUs or business groups.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had told lawmakers during previous congressional hearings that this allowed for LGUs and the private sector to take part in vaccine procurement – something unique to the Philippines, as vaccine manufacturers have so far preferred to deal directly with national governments only.According to Galvez, tripartite deals allow the Philippines to meet this condition of vaccine companies which they observed with all countries, especially as supplies of vaccines remain severely limited.",0.0,0.9154000282287598,"get, ph, moderna, case, china, sinovac, filipino, duterte, dose, willing","['health', 'expert', 'strongly', 'oppose', 'bill', 'allow', 'lgus', 'directly', 'buy']",0.4588,0.0,0.636,0.364,0.5666666666666667,Positive

Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo announced on Friday, October 30, that Chinese company Clover Biopharmaceuticals has applied to conduct clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccine in the country.
(Editor's note: An earlier version of this report referred to Clover Biopharmaceuticals as an Australian company. This has been corrected.)
In a virtual press briefing on Friday morning, Domingo said that Clover has submitted its clinical trials data to the vaccine expert panel (VEP) for evaluation.
Domingo said he could not give more details about Clover as he only knew about its intent on Friday.
To date, at at least 3 companies expressed interest in conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines. Under such trials, a vaccine is given to hundreds of people split into different age groups.
Aside from Clover, health officials cited China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Sputnik V among candidate vaccines that could possibly see independent trials in the country.For Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine, the VEP is still evaluating data from phases 1 and 2 of its clinical trials. According to the New York Times’ vaccine tracker, this vaccine is a ""combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene.""
As for Sinovac, the VEP has endorsed this to the FDA. Domingo said the agency is anticipating the submission of its application for Phase 3 trials after it gets the endorsement of the ethics board.Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect one's health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.

The government allocates the first tranche of Pfizer vaccines for hospital-based healthcare workers
The Philippine pandemic task force has included persons with comorbidities in its list of priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination. Teachers and social workers, meanwhile, have been placed in the 2nd tier of prioritization.
The new list was made public on Friday, February 5, by Presidential Spokesman and task force spokesman Harry Roque.
The list was formulated by the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG), a team of health experts advising the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Here is the new list:
A1: Frontline workers in health facilities both national and local, private and public, health professionals and non-professionals like students, nursing aides, janitors, barangay health workers, etc.
A2: Senior citizens aged 60 years old and aboveA3: Persons with comorbidities not otherwise included in the preceding categoriesA4: Frontline personnel in essential sectors including uniformed personnel and those in working sectors identified by the IATF as essential during ECQA5: Indigent population not otherwise included in the preceding categories
B1: Teachers, social workersB2: Other government workersB3: Other essential workersB4: Socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigent peopleB5: Overseas Filipino WorkersB6: Other remaining workforceC: Rest of the Filipino population not otherwise included in the above groups
Health workers to get Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine
The task force also said it is allocating the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, expected to arrive this month, for health frontliners.
The first tranche will be given to frontliners in the following health facilities:
COVID-19 dedicated hospitals
COVID-19 referral hospitals
Hospitals owned by the Department of Health
Local government hospitals
Hospitals for uniformed services or personnel
Private hospitals
The Pfizer vaccines arriving in February are coming in through the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility. The Philippines was able to qualify for the mechanism's early vaccine roll-out, intended to give developing countries affordable, equitable access to COVID-19 jabs.
Changing minds
In the first priority list released to the public, persons with comorbidities were not in the first tier of the list, which was dominated by health frontliners, senior citizens, and indigent Filipinos.
The World Health Organization has identified those with heart or lung disease, diabetes, or conditions affecting their immune system as ""high-risk"" because they are more likely to experience a severe COVID-19 infection.
Some members of the task force, including Roque, had argued for including persons with comorbidities but the idea was initially thumbed down.
""The other camp was saying, anyway most senior citizens with comorbidities already have priority,"" said Roque last January 11.
But another reason given for not including persons with comorbidities is that it would supposedly allow more people a chance to skip the line.
""There was some discussion because some are mistrustful, that it might be a loophole used by some to get ahead, even if they don't have [comorbidities],"" said Roque.
Meanwhile, the new list does not include families of military personnel, despite President Rodrigo Duterte's promise in a speech in front of soldiers in Sulu.
Prioritization based on area
The task force, meanwhile, said it would prioritize geographic areas that have both high transmission rates and readiness to roll out vaccines.
The criteria is as follows:

'But somebody dropped the ball,' tweets Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr
As the Philippines struggles to secure enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said on Tuesday, December 15, that an offer was made to secure the country 10 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine for as early as January 2021.But the arrangement supposedly fell through, Locsin said, as “somebody dropped the ball” on the possible purchase of the vaccine facilitated by Locsin and Philippine Ambassador to the United State Jose “Babe” Romualdez with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.“That said my thanks just the same to US Sec of State Mike Pompeo we – Babe Romualdez and I – got 10 million doses of Pfizer financed by World Bank and ADB to be shipped thru FEDEX to Clark in January. But somebody dropped the ball,” Locsin tweeted on Tuesday.Locsin did not disclose further details when asked who was responsible for the missed opportunity. The foreign affairs chief instead said Philippine vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr was already ordering doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, which has been the first to be used in countries that have started their mass vaccination campaigns against the disease.In a briefing at Malacañang earlier on Tuesday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said he had “no idea” who Locsin was referring to.Despite this, Roque denied the government failed to act early in securing supplies of Pfizer’s vaccine, citing as proof Locsin’s negotiations with Pompeo.“Alam ko po maaga pa nakipag-negotiate na po si Secretary Locsin dahil naaalala ko po iyang meeting na iyan pero maagang-maaga pa po in 2020 nakipag-negotiate na po si Secretary Locsin.

'Requirements and standard agreements are common to all countries. They're not specific to the Philippines, and they are not related to...Dengvaxia,' says WHO Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.
World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe denied the Philippines was being asked for specific requirements in its indemnification agreement with vaccine firm Pfizer due to the Dengvaxia dengue controversy.This is contrary to claims made by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr who earlier said that arrest warrants issued in relation to the Dengvaxia scandal in the Philippines impacted the government’s negotiation efforts with manufacturers.Galvez attributed the delay in vaccine procurement to the Dengvaxia issue. He told reporters, “The situation changed. We have to understand. What happened with the warrants of arrest for Sanofi, it has great implications on our procurement, really.” He added that the arrest warrants announced last February 1 “changed everything.”But In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, February 23, Abeyasinghe clarified the Philippines was instead asked to sign onto a “standard” indemnification agreement similar to those presented to different countries receiving the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.“Let me clarify that the requirements and standard agreements are common to all countries. They're not specific to the Philippines, and they are not related to any issue that happened in the country relating to Dengvaxia or anything else,” he said when asked if the Philippines was being asked for special indemnity requirements.
Abeyasinghe made the statement after the rollout of the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccination had been delayed due to paperwork on indemnification agreements required by manufacturers as vaccines are still under emergency use authorization worldwide.The Philippines earlier targeted to start its vaccination campaign by February 2021, with initial doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine supplied by the WHO’s COVAX facility.What's the status of delivery now?
Abeyasinghe said the issues raised between Pfizer and the Philippine government included the need for an indemnification law in the Philippines as well as “several minor clauses” in a letter detailing indemnification requirements.Philippine lawmakers were seeking to address the need for legislation on indemnification with the passage of bills creating an indemnification fund for adverse events following immunization. The House of Representatives passed its version of the measure on Monday, February 23, while the Senate passed a counterpart bill on Tuesday.As to requirements listed in a letter between the Philippines and Pfizer, the WHO said Philippine officials received documents on these details Tuesday morning.“So maybe today or tomorrow we will see a resolution of that impasse and maybe there'll be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe said.As for initial AstraZeneca doses coming from the COVAX facility, Abeyasinghe said the Department of Health had supplied “all letters necessary” to access supplies part of an early rollout of the vaccine. AstraZeneca, he added, did not require a further exchange of letters on the indemnification requirement.Abeyasinghe said the WHO remained optimistic it would pin down an initial date of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for the Philippines this week with doses to be sourced from those manufactured in South Korea.Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca have secured emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration with first doses to be given to frontline health workers in 32 hospitals across Manila, along with two more in Cebu City and Davao City.As more countries across the region started the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines among their populations, health workers and local officials tasked with distributing vaccines said they were ready to start vaccinating people by the government’s targeted February rollout.

IBP president Domingo Egon Cayosa joined calls for the government to inform Filipinos about the vaccines they intend to purchase, citing provisions of the Constitution and an executive order by President Rodrigo Duterte.
""Transparency is helpful in establishing facts, dispelling doubts and suspicions, countering propaganda, minimizing political posturing, curbing corruption, promoting accountability, nurturing cooperation, and in enhancing trust in our country’s governance,"" Cayosa said in a statement.
He said the policy of public disclosure on transactions involving public interest, coupled with an acknowledgment of the people's right to information, is found in Article II, Section 28, and Article III, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution.
Cayosa said that the Supreme Court interpreted these provisions as seeking to ""promote transparency in policy-making and in the operations of the government, as well as provide the people sufficient information to exercise effectively other constitutional rights.""

Government officials in charge of securing COVID-19 vaccines for the Philippines face mounting demands for transparency amid questions on the price and efficacy of the shots they seek to procure.
Much of the doubt has centered on what critics say is the government's seeming preference for Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac, whose vaccine was reportedly one of the most expensive among other candidate brands.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque claimed that each dose of Sinovac's product would cost just around P650, much lower than the initially reported figure of over P3,600 for two doses.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. said the government is negotiating for the ""best price.""

PANTI,2021-01-28 11:20:00,"The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization for AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, its director general, Dr. Eric Domingo, announced on Thursday.
This makes AstraZeneca, a British pharmaceutical firm, the second company to secure an EUA in the Philippines after Pfizer BioNTech.
Domingo said AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, which it developed with Oxford University, has posted an efficacy rate of 70% after first dose.
“All conditions for EUA are present, and the benefit of using the vaccine outweighs potential risk,” Domingo said during the day's Laging Handa briefing.
“The interim data, taken in its entirety, showed an efficacy rate of 70% after the first dose. Tumataas ito pagkatapos bigyan ng second dose, depende rin sa length of time kung kelan ibinigay iyong second dose,” he added.

Domingo also said that AstraZeneca initially showed it is very effective in preventing severe COVID-19 infection.
“Iyong data ng AstraZeneca showed it is very good in preventing severe COVID-19, halos 100% rin. Kaya lang maliit pa ang datos nila, at maa-update pa ‘yan. So iyong 70% [na efficacy after first dose], kahit may nagkasakit [ng COVID-19], hindi grabe,” he added.
Domingo said that the two doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine can be administered four to 12 weeks apart on individuals aged 18 years and above. The vaccine can only be administered by the vaccine providers determined by the Department of Health.
The FDA Chief, however, clarified that close monitoring and surveillance is still needed after immunization.
AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccin has posted an efficacy rate of 90% after human trials ahead of the Philippine FDA evaluation. Human trials abroad showed that it is 70% effective after two standard doses, but it improved to 90% after the first dose was reduced to half.
Domingo, however, said that AstraZeneca’s vaccine’s potential to reach a higher efficacy rate was not dependent on the amount of doses administered.
“Tuloy tuloy pa po ang clinical trials [for AstraZeneca’s vaccine], but currently it does not depend on half dose then standard dose, or standard dose then [another standard dose]. It is more [dependent] on the time difference between first and second doses,” he said.
As for adverse effects of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, Domingo said they were transient and mild to moderate, similar to a regular vaccine.
“Ang pananakit doon sa lugar ng injection, konting sinat, konting sakit na ulo...that can all be easily managed. Walang special na precaution up to date kasi walang specific safety concerns na naidentify,” Domingo said.
The Philippines has already inked a supply deal for 17 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca so far, a number that is good for around 8.5 million individuals since it is administered in two doses. These AstraZeneca doses, however, are expected to arrive only by June this year.
AstraZeneca, which only requires a standard storage temperature of 2°C to 8°C, has already secured an EUA in the United Kingdom whose regulatory authority is considered a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) by the World Health Organization.
An Executive Order issued by President Rodrigo Duterte in November 2020 has allowed the FDA to issue an EUA on COVID-19 vaccines within 21 days since the vaccine-maker submitted its EUA application, provided that such vaccine already secured an EUA from other regulatory bodies classified as SRA by WHO.
The Philippine FDA earlier granted EUA to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine after it was found to be 95% and 92% effective in a study population and among all races, respectively.
Likewise, the FDA said that Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine can be administered to 16 years old and above and that its side effects were found to be transient, mild to moderate and similar to common vaccine reactions.
A vaccine needs to secure an EUA from the FDA for it to be legally administered in the Philippines.
An EUA, however, is not a substitute for Certificate for Product Registration and as such, cannot be used to sell the vaccine commercially.
Other COVID-19 vaccines with pending EUA application before the FDA include that of Sinovac, Gamaleya and Bharat BioTech.

1. Where can we get a vaccine?
Based on vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief Implementor Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.’s report to President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night, the Philippines is eyeing at least three to four vaccines for use in the Philippines with the earliest coming in the second quarter of next year.
The three vaccines, in order of stages of negotiations, are:
AztraZeneca from the United Kingdom; 
Sinovac from China; and
Pfizer from the US.

  Galvez said through the Food and Drug Administration, a memorandum of understanding can be signed with AstraZeneca as early as end of November, with the company committing at least 20 million doses.
The United Kingdom also gave assurance it will help the Philippines with the rollout of the vaccine by sending its soldiers. Rollout could be simultaneous with that of the United Kingdom. Earliest best case scenario is second quarter of next year.
AztraZeneca has reported up to 90% efficacy against COVID-19, Pfizer at 95%, while Sinovac is being used in China on an emergency basis.
From these three sources alone, Galvez said the Philippines could come up with 60 million vaccines that will be enough to trigger a herd immunity in the Philippines according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
The Philippines is also in talks with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute and US’ Johnson and Johnson.
2. How soon can we get a vaccine? 
As early as second quarter of next year, according to Galvez.
The Philippines is in advance talks with AztraZeneca. A memorandum of understanding could be signed as early as end of November.
3. Who will get the vaccine? 
Galvez said individuals from areas that are highly infected by COVID-19 will be vaccinated first.
He mentioned the National Capital Region, Davao, Cebu, and Bacolod initially.
In these highly infected areas, people from the poorest of the poor under the 4Ps beneficiary list will be vaccinated first, followed by other sectors like healthcare workers, the police and the military.
Duterte emphasized the need to prioritize the military and the police, saying he needs them to be healthy. The police and the military along with barangay officials will help in the rollout of the vaccine.
The government has promised to vaccinate all Filipinos for free.
In previous “Talk to the Nation Addresses,” Galvez said big corporations are also making efforts to secure vaccines for their employees and donate a sizeable chunk to the government.
4. How much will the vaccines cost?
According to Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, the vaccines will cost about P73 billion.
He’s pegging it at $25 dollars per Filipino or at P1,200 per Filipino for 60 million Filipinos.
Vaccinating 60 million Filipinos is enough to trigger herd immunity, according to Duque, which is simply having more people immune to COVID-19 effectively slowing down if not cutting off transmission. —BAP/KG, GMA News",GMA News,2020-11-24 02:10:00,"Here's all you need to know about where and when we can get COVID-19 vaccines, who will be among those vaccinated first, and how much it will cost.Based on vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief Implementor Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.’s report to President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night, the Philippines is eyeing at least three to four vaccines for use in the Philippines with the earliest coming in the second quarter of next year.The three vaccines, in order of stages of negotiations, are: AztraZeneca from the United Kingdom; Sinovac from China; and Pfizer from the US.From these three sources alone, Galvez said the Philippines could come up with 60 million vaccines that will be enough to trigger a herd immunity in the Philippines according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.The Philippines is in advance talks with AztraZeneca.3.

A fellow frontrunner in the global vaccine race, US biotech company Moderna, said on Monday that it had sought emergency regulatory approval for its Covid-19 shot in both the United States and Europe.
The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are both based on a new technology that uses mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) to deliver genetic material to the body that makes human cells create a protein from the virus.
This trains the immune system to be ready to attack if it encounters the novel coronavirus.
But Moderna's vaccine can be kept in long term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus four degrees Fahrenheit) while Pfizer's requires minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
The two vaccines have been developed at breathtaking speed as part of an unprecedented effort to end a pandemic that has infected more than 62 million people worldwide and killed more than 1.4 million.

PANTI,2021-02-19 09:50:00,"Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said Friday that COVID-19 vaccine makers are pushing for indemnity agreement due to the Dengvaxia experience, citing vaccine czar Carlito Galvez’s earlier claims.
Roque made the remark when reporters pressed him on the arrival date of COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines after the delay.
“Alam niyo po talagang ang sinabi sa atin ng COVAX facility eh darating yung kanilang Pfizer  eh dapat sa gitna ng Pebrero. Pero naantala nga po bakit?

Roque mistakenly referred to Dengvaxia maker Sanofi Pasteur and not Pfizer, which he later corrected.
“Kaya humihingi sila ng indemnity agreement dahil ang kanilang bakuna ay covered ng EUA (emergency use authorization), at hindi pa ng general use authorization. Gumalaw naman po ang ating pamahalaan, ang Kongreso ay bumubuo ng isang batas na nagsasabi na gobyerno na ang magbabayad ng danyos para sa lahat ng magkakaroon ng side effects.

The Dengvaxia controversy started in November 2017 when Sanofi-Pasteur announced that their vaccine posed a risk to those who were not infected by dengue prior to being injected with the vaccine.
However, the announcement only came after the vaccine had been administered to over 700,000 children and even policemen.
At least 100 vaccinated individuals have died of unconfirmed causes after receiving Dengvaxia doses, and health officials have ruled that that fatalities cannot be directly linked to the vaccine.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Sanofi returned P1.16 billion to the Department of Health for the unused doses of vaccine.
In correcting himself, Roque still insisted that Pfizer is seeking indemnity for its COVID-19 vaccines because of Sanofi-Pasteur’s Dengvaxia experience.
“Lilinawin ko, mukhang mali ang sinabi ko kanina. Ang manufacturer ng dengvaxia ay Sanofi hindi Pfizer. Pero alam nyo po puro Europeans yan naguusap-usap po yan. Kaya nga po parang naging mas maingat ang Pfizer bilang isang kapwa European manufacturer ng Sanofi pagdating sa pagsusuplay ng EUA,” Roque added.
However, Pfizer is an American company, and not European.
Later, Roque said that COVID-19 vaccines, which are approved for emergency use, are not similar to Dengvaxia that had been approved for general use.
“Uulitin ko po ang sinabi ng mga dalubhasa. Sinabi ni dating [Health] Secratary [Esperanza] Cabral, ang Dengvaxia po eh dumaan sa proseso, hindi lang sa Pilipinas kung hindi sa buong mundo at sa WHO (World Health Organization).

The Brazilian state of Bahia has also signed an agreement to conduct Phase III clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine and plans to buy 50 million doses to market in northeastern Brazil.

Ang Probinsyano party-list Representative Ronnie Ong on Monday filed House Bill 8280, wherein he stressed the need for an unhampered implementation and maximization of the government's COVID-19 immunization program.
""Although the COVID-19 inoculation is still a few months away from entering our borders, it is but proper to take further preparations and necessary steps for its unhampered implementation and maximization,"" Ong said.
""In line with this, it is our hope that this bill will be considered and approved the soonest possible time before the possible roll out of the vaccine on June 2021 in order to restore people’s trust and confidence to travel with the end view of reviving and bolstering our economy,” he added.
Ong said the vaccine passport may be used as an identification system that allows people to access public facilities and participate in mass gatherings without needing face masks or face shields.

In effect, the vaccine passport will serve as proof that the holder is safe to mingle with other people and engage in activities even without wearing face masks or face shields and observing social distancing.
Under the measure, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19, particularly the Department of Health, Department of Tourism, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department of Transportation, is mandated to “coordinate and provide for a single internationally-recognized vaccine passport to serve as proof that a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19.”
The said vaccine passport should be issued ""as a matter of right whether or not the person availed of the free vaccination program of the government or was vaccinated through personal and other means.""
Contents of the vaccine passport should include the basic personal information of the holder such as full name, address, date of birth; type and purpose of vaccine, batch number, date administered and the name of the entity that administered the vaccine; and other relevant medical information.
The IATF is also mandated under the measure to list down and regularly update the exemptions or activities allowed for holders of the COVID-19 vaccine passport, including:

Employment abroad;
Local checkpoint and quarantine exemptions;
Opening of and Access to some business establishments; and
Post-vaccination protocols applicable to Vaccine Passport holders, as may be determined by the IATF, in relation to rules on public gatherings, use of face mask and face shield, etc.
Production and possession of forged or fake vaccine passport will be penalized under RA 8239 or the Passport Act of 1996, the measure indicated.

Variant in Brazil more likely to reinfect survivors
A coronavirus variant circulating in Brazil is likely able to reinfect people who survived infections with earlier versions of the coronavirus, new data suggest.
The variant that emerged in Brazil, called P.1, carries a mutation that is already known to make a variant prevalent in South Africa harder to treat with antibodies and harder to prevent with available vaccines.
New data suggest that in many recovered patients, immunity to earlier versions of the virus will not afford immunity to P.1.

Researchers tested the neutralizing ability of antibodies in plasma samples taken from survivors of COVID-19 caused by earlier versions of the virus.
The plasma ""had 6-fold less neutralizing capacity"" against the P.1 variant than against earlier virus versions, the researchers reported on Monday ahead of peer-review on a preprint server belonging to The Lancet journal.
""Lower neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and partial immunity against new variants suggests that reinfection could occur in convalescent or even vaccinated individuals,"" the authors said.
In a separate paper posted on Wednesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, some of the same researchers estimated that among every 100 survivors of COVID-19 due to earlier virus versions, 25-to-60 could become reinfected if exposed to the P.1 variant because their antibodies could not protect them.
As of Thursday, according to the US Centers for Disease Control of Prevention, there have been 13 cases of COVID-19 due to P.1 in the United States.
COVID-19 vaccine antibodies pass into breast milk
COVID-19 antibodies induced by vaccines from Pfizer Inc/BioNTech and Moderna Inc can pass into breast milk, a small study suggests, although it is not clear yet how long the antibodies will be present.
Six breastfeeding mothers who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines provided researchers with milk samples before and after vaccination, with the last sample collected two weeks after the second shot.
None of the women had been infected with the coronavirus.
A week after the first shot, all of the women had COVID-19 antibodies in their breast milk.
Antibody levels fell slightly afterward and then sharply increased after the second shot.
The two vaccines were similarly effective in inducing the antibodies, although antibody levels varied from woman to woman, the research team reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.

“Itong bakuna galing Russia... ito ay nasa Phase 3 ng clinical trials. Kailangang tapusin muna Phase 3 clinical trials.” 
Vergeire also said aside from the one in Russia, the country is also considering five other possible vaccines from other countries. She said experts from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) are studying which of the six is best for the Philippines.
“Iyong DOST, may vaccine experts po tayo roon. May anim na bakuna na all over the world na nasa Phase 3 ng clinical trials,” she said.

""Wala pa po kaming na-receive na clinical trial application,"" Dr. Jesusa Cirunay, director of FDA's Center for Drug Regulation and Research, said in an online forum.
She explained that under a normal course, it would take about 45 to 60 days to approve an application for a clinical trial but it would be facilitated faster for COVID-19 vaccines.
""It will be lesser for COVID, provided that the documents submitted are complete. Kailangan namin ang kumpletong dokumento matanggap because we cannot process it kung kulang-kulang ang dokumento,"" Cirunay said.
The approval of the Phase 4 trial or the last stage, on the other hand, will generally take about 70 to 90 more working days. This part can be expedited for the COVID-19 vaccine, she added.

President Rodrigo Duterte, during his fifth State of the Nation Address, claimed that a vaccine against COVID-19 is ""just around the corner.""
He even expressed willingness to get the first shot of the Russian-developed Sputnik V vaccine.
Sputnik V trial results
While many are pinning their hopes on this Russian vaccine, the local experts underscored that the results of its Phases 1 and 2 trials were not even published yet.
""Hindi pa po natin nakikita ang Phase 1 and Phase 2 results of this. It has to be published in the scientific world so that everybody can look into its safety, tolerability as well as the effectiveness,"" Dr. Josefina Carlos, an infectious disease specialist and a vaccine clinical trialist, said.
""The results are not published yet in the scientific world, if I may say,"" she added.
Dr. Jacinto Mantaring also said the Single Joint Research Ethics Board, which he chairs, has not received any official document yet for Sputnik V's clinical trial in the Philippines.
""Wala pa kaming natatanggap na any form of application for the clinical trial pero ang masasabi ko, kasama kasi sa review ng isang trial ang literature,"" he said.
""We will not allow any trial if there is no preliminary proof of efficacy and safety... Ang layunin ng Phase 1 and Phase 2 is more of safety. Pag nakitang safe doon pa lang gagawa ng Phase 3,"" he added.
Sputnik V will likely be available for commercial use in the Philippines by April 2021, according to Philippine Council for Health Research executive director Dr. Jaime Montoya as Russia's FDA is seen to approve it this coming January.
For now, Russia plans enlisting 10,000 individuals in four countries —UAE, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and the Philippines—for the Phase 3 of the clinical trials for Sputnik V and around 1,000 Filipinos are expected to join.

German biotech company CureVac, which began late-stage testing of the vaccine in December and expects to announce interim results this quarter, said it aims to produce up to 300 million doses in 2021 and between 600 million and 1 billion doses in 2022.
Bayer, making the first foray into vaccine manufacturing in its 160-year history, expects to produce 160 million doses of the CureVac shot in 2022 at its Wuppertal site in western Germany, head of pharma Stefan Oelrich told a news conference.
Though the volume target was for next year, Bayer hopes to be able to launch production in 2021, Oerlich said.
""For us, the biggest bottleneck in building the production line is to be able to have the production gear installed in time,"" he told Reuters.

Bayer is the latest big drugmaker to join the push to remedy a shortfall of COVID-19 vaccines after Novartis and Sanofi both said last week that they would help to produce Pfizer's shot.
Separately, CureVac said it had teamed up with contract drugmaker Rentschler to ramp up production.
Manufacturing processes are being tested at Rentschler's site in Laupheim in south-west Germany, which is expected to produce more than 100 million doses a year, the two companies said.
European governments have faced criticism over supply and production bottlenecks as vaccine makers AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna have all announced cuts to deliveries just when they were expected to ramp up production.
Germany is Europe's largest economy, but many Germans have looked on enviously at the faster pace of COVID-19 vaccination programs in Britain, Israel and the United States.
Keen to show it is taking action, the federal government is due to meet regional leaders, vaccine manufacturers and European representatives later on Monday to discuss how to boost output.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia had reached a deal with Swedish-British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to receive the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Oxford University.
""The Oxford vaccine is one of the most advanced and promising in the world, and under this deal we have secured early access for every Australian,"" he said.
""If this vaccine proves successful we will manufacture and supply vaccines straight away under our own steam and make it free for 25 million Australians.""
The Oxford vaccine is one of five globally in Phase 3 efficacy trials, and researchers hope to have results by the end of the year.

It is the first such deal for Australia, and Morrison said his government was also in talks with ""many parties around the world"" over other potential vaccines as well as supporting local scientists in their efforts.
The country is yet to reach a final agreement with AstraZeneca on the cost, and a local manufacturer has not been locked in.
However, Australia has signed an Aus$25 million ($18 million) agreement with American medical technology company Becton Dickinson to buy 100 million needles and syringes to administer the doses.
Although none of the coronavirus vaccines under development has proved its efficacy yet in clinical trials, at least 5.7 billion doses have been pre-ordered around the world.

Five vaccines -- three Western and two Chinese -- are in Phase 3 efficacy trials involving thousands of people, including the Oxford vaccine.

AstraZeneca has also signed agreements to provide doses to the US, Europe and Brazil.
Another deal struck by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, would see India manufacture the Oxford vaccine for distribution in 57 low- and middle-income countries.

First shipments of a COVID-19 vaccine created by Western laboratories have often been snapped up by the United States.

Morrison said Australia remained ""committed"" to ensuring early access to the potential vaccine for Pacific countries and regional partners in Southeast Asia.

Earlier this month he called on nations to share potential vaccines, saying any country that discovered one and did not make it available globally ""would be judged terribly by history"".

Australia has recorded almost 24,000 cases of COVID-19 and 438 fatalities to date.

Early in the pandemic it was considered among the most successful at curbing the virus's spread until an outbreak in Melbourne, the country's second-biggest city, that authorities struggled to contain.

The outbreak -- which was traced back to two hotels being used to quarantine travellers returning from overseas -- has ravaged aged-care homes in the city, causing dozens of deaths.

President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to personally welcome the arrival of the Chinese vaccines, according to his former close aide, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go.
On Monday, 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine will also be delivered to the Philippines around noontime, said presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. The AstraZeneca delivery was part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX facility.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and Galvez are set to receive Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine shots on Monday morning to boost public confidence in the vaccine, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go said Sunday.
Prior to the expected arrival of the vaccines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines emergency use authorization (EUA).
“Ito po ay isang pagpapatunay na ang lahat ng mga bakuna na ating ituturok sa ating mga kababayan ay ligtas at epektibo,” Galvez said.
""Kaya’t hinihikayat po namin ang ating mga kababayang Pilipino na magparehistro na sa kanilang mga barangay at upang kayo ay makapagpabakuna na,” he added.
Healthcare workers
The PGH Physicians' Association, however, said the Sinovac vaccine should undergo further appraisal by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) before being administered to healthcare workers.
The association said the expected administration of the Sinovac vaccine at PGH was met with a “sweeping disapproval rate of 95 percent” among the hospital's residents and fellows.
Although Sinovac was given EUA by the FDA, it was not recommended for healthcare workers due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4% for the group.
Still, the Department of Health has said the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group has agreed to recommend Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccines for health workers.
“We recognize the efforts of the PGH Administration in hastening the vaccination process for its constituents. However, the vaccination plan should have been handled with more prudence and transparency,” the PGH Physicians' Association said.
“As the national university hospital, PGH should set an example on how vaccination rollout should be executed in the country. PGH should uphold the ideals of ethical and evidence-based medicine, for which it has been a bastion of,” it added.
Indemnity fund
Last Friday, Duterte also signed into law the Vaccination Program Act of 2021 which would expedite the rollout of the country's vaccination program against COVID-19.
The measure also provides a P500-million indemnity fund for individuals who will experience adverse effects after getting the jab.
Galvez welcomed the passage of the law, saying that it would provide flexibility and indemnity in the procurement and administration of the vaccines.

""Vaccinating the world against COVID-19 will be one of the largest mass undertakings in human history, and we will need to move as quickly as the vaccines can be produced,"" said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore.
""By the end of the year, we will already have over half a billion syringes pre-positioned where they can be deployed quickly and cost effectively.""
The syringes will be used by COVAX, the international coronavirus vaccine procurement, production and distribution pool created by the World Health Organization (WHO).
COVAX is run by the Gavi vaccine alliance, which will reimburse UNICEF for the syringes.
A public-private partnership, Gavi helps vaccinate half the world's children against some of the deadliest diseases on the planet.
Syringes have a five-year shelf life and tend to be shipped by sea, rather than vaccines, which are heat-sensitive and transported more quickly by air freight.
The billion syringes come on top of the 620 million that UNICEF would purchase for other vaccination programs against diseases such as measles and typhoid.

COVAX is co-led by GAVI vaccines alliance, the World Health Organization, and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It aims to deliver two billion doses of effective, approved COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.

Some common-cold antibodies might help fight COVID-19
Antibodies to the six coronaviruses that cause common colds cannot ""neutralize"" the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but antibodies to two of them might at least help the body fend off severe illness from the new virus, a small preliminary study suggests.
German researchers studied 60 patients with COVID-19, including 25 who were hospitalized but not critically ill, 19 who required intensive care unit admission, and 25 who did not get sick enough to be hospitalized.
The patients who needed intensive care all had significantly lower levels of antibodies to two seasonal coronaviruses, HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1, which the authors said are more closely related to the COVID-19 virus compared to the other human coronaviruses.

While the observation does not prove these antibodies are responsible, ""it is remarkable that the effect of HCoV OC43 and HKU1-specific antibody levels reached statistical significance regarding the need for intensive care therapy"" in such a small study, the researchers said in a paper published on Tuesday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.
""Further studies should validate this finding and explore the potential to identify persons at risk for severe disease course before a SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" they said.
Vaccine side effects may affect mammograms
Routine mammograms should be done either before the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or four-to-six weeks after the second dose, the Society for Breast Imaging advises.
The vaccines' temporary side effects can include swollen lymph nodes around the armpits, which could be misread as a possible sign of breast cancer if it turns up on a mammogram.
So-called axillary lymphadenopathy is usually seen in only 0.02%-0.04% of screening mammograms, according to the Society's guidelines.
In trials of the Moderna vaccine, the condition developed in 11.6% of participants after the first dose and in 16% after the second dose.
Researchers testing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine did not routinely ask participants about armpit tenderness and lymph node swelling, but some people reported this side effect, which lasted an average of 10 days.

The British drugmaker said it will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, around four times as many as US competitor Pfizer. Seven hundred million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.
""This means we have a vaccine for the world,"" said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford University vaccine group that developed the drug.
The vaccine on average prevented 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil but the success rate rose to 90% if the vaccine was administered as a half dose followed by a full dose. The efficacy was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most study participants.
No serious safety events were confirmed, the company said.

AstraZeneca's shares fell 4%, on track for their worst daily performance in six-months, as investors perceived the efficacy data as disappointing compared with rivals. Pfizer and Moderna , which reported that their vaccines prevented around 95% of cases, had set the bar for success sky-high.
The AstraZeneca shot does, however, have some advantages over offerings from U.S. rivals.
The drug's cost to governments works out at just a few dollars a shot, a fraction of the price of shots from Pfizer and Moderna, which use a more unconventional technology.
It can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute, especially in poor countries, than Pfizer's, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C.
The faster roll-out means both rich and poor countries that had been drawing up plans to ration vaccines can distribute them more widely, helping to eventually halt the social and economic disruption of a pandemic that has killed 1.4 million people.
""The bulk of the vaccine rollout programme will be in January, February, March. And we hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal,"" said Matt Hancock, health secretary of Britain which has pre-ordered 100 million doses for its 67 million people.
In poor countries, where the logistics of distributing rival vaccines posed a bigger challenge, the effect of a cheaper and easier alternative could be even more pronounced. Zahid Maleque, health minister of Bangladesh, which is buying in 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine made in India, called the findings ""really good news"".
""The big advantage of having the vaccine is that it can be stored, transported and handled at 2-8 degrees Celsius, and we have that storage facility,"" he said.
The World Health Organization's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan called the results ""encouraging"" and said the health body looked forward to seeing the data.
""We welcome the efforts of Oxford/AZ to make the vaccine affordable and easy to store, which will be good for countries and people everywhere.""
""WE'LL BE A LOT HAPPIER""
Nevertheless, there was criticism of AstraZeneca's findings.
Analysts from SVB Leerink, a healthcare-focused investment bank, said AstraZeneca had not yet disclosed enough information about safety events that had forced it to temporarily put a study on hold in the United States.
Leerink noted that only a small number of people had received the smaller first dose. Of 131 cases of COVID-19 in the study, researchers did not say how many had received the smaller initial dose to form the basis for their 90% efficacy finding.
Leerink said it was unlikely the vaccine would be approved for use in the United States, because the data so far did not match requirements set by regulators there. AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose.
Some scientists said all three vaccines could prove comparable in the end.
""I think it is a real fool's errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of phase 3 data from press releases,"" said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London.
""For the bigger picture, my suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we'll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we'll be a lot happier.""
Pascal Soriot, Astra's chief executive, said the smaller initial dose was good news, as it meant limited supplies could stretch further to vaccinate more people.
The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, a different approach from Pfizer and Moderna, which rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA).
AstraZeneca will now prepare regulatory submission of the data to authorities around the world that have a framework for conditional or early approval. It will also seek an emergency use listing from the WHO to speed up availability in poor countries. -- Reuters",GMA News,2020-11-24 00:05:00,"The efficacy was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most study participants.It can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute, especially in poor countries, than Pfizer's, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C.Analysts from SVB Leerink, a healthcare-focused investment bank, said AstraZeneca had not yet disclosed enough information about safety events that had forced it to temporarily put a study on hold in the United States.Of 131 cases of COVID-19 in the study, researchers did not say how many had received the smaller initial dose to form the basis for their 90% efficacy finding.AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose.Some scientists said all three vaccines could prove comparable in the end.""For the bigger picture, my suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we'll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we'll be a lot happier.""",3.0,0.7903000116348267,"dose, duterte, get, arrive, coronavirus, astrazeneca, pfizer, first, country, palace","['astrazeneca', 'world', 'effective']",0.4767,0.0,0.392,0.608,0.8,Positive

""I’m okay with any brand of anti-COVID-19 vaccine. I’m not brand conscious. I put my trust in the FDA,” he added.
A total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, just about a week after the FDA granted it emergency use authorization.
FDA director general Dr. Eric Domingo said Sinovac’s efficacy ranged from 65.3% to 91.2% but only reached 50.4% among health workers with COVID-19 exposure.
This makes it not recommended for health workers, he added.
“This should be administered by vaccination providers and to prevent COVID-19 in clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old,” Domingo had said.
However, Domingo clarified on Tuesday that health workers can still choose to get vaccinated with Sinovac since they merely made a recommendation on which groups it is not suited for.
Prior to the vaccination drive on Monday, a nationwide survey conducted by OCTA Research group showed that only 19% of adult Filipinos want to get a COVID-19 vaccine while 46% said they do not want to be vaccinated against the illness.

“Yes [I will do it]. Definitely. That is a no brainer. Sure. No problem,” Duque said in an ANC interview on Monday.

The city has also identified two possible storage areas for the COVID-19 vaccines: the JC Vaccine Storage along Edsa and the Quezon City Health Department warehouse near the Amoranto Stadium.
When asked about the challenges the local government is facing in the COVID vaccination program, Juico identified manpower as the number one issue.

“The COVID-19 vaccination is just an add on factor where to ease restrictions or not at this point in time where the vaccine will come in tranches and will still have to see if the vaccine can block COVID-19 transmission,” Vergeire said during the Laging Handa briefing.
“Also, we can only reach the potential efficacy rate of the vaccines after two doses, so we have to take that into consideration. Ang way pa rin natin [in deciding] at iyong number of cases, health care utilization rate…the vaccination will be an add on factor,” she added.
The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility, which include that of Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, is due to arrive in the country within the first quarter and is expected to be deployed in COVID-19 referral hospitals.

The President also expressed confidence that the Filipino people and the economic managers will understand the situation, Go said.
The National Economic Development Authority has proposed placing the entire Philippines under the MGCQ starting March 1 supposedly to balance the country's response to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the need of Filipinos to start earning and spending.

PANTI,2021-01-20 14:06:00,"The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) can store more than one million doses of COVID-19 vaccines requiring ultra low storage, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday. 
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the announcement a day after Deputy Chief Implementer Vince Dizon of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 said the government is already negotiating with 28 private companies to ensure proper storage of COVID-19 vaccines to preserve their efficacy.
“RITM has five ultra low freezers for COVID-19 vaccines which can accommodate -20 to -80 degrees Celsius storage requirement,” the DOH official said in an online briefing. 
“Each ultra low freezer can store up to 230,200 doses or 46,240 vials,” she added.
In addition, Vergeire earlier said the DOH's 17 regional offices have equipment that can store vaccines requiring the 2 to 8 degrees Celsius storage temperature.

“We have this existing capacity of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius storage which [preservation] can last up to three months,” she said. 
Likewise, Vergeire said DOH has enough portable transport boxes for vaccine deployment because existing national immunization programs are being done house-to-house, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The DOH official, however, said the Health department does not have refrigerated trucks for vaccine deployment and such service is being contracted whenever the need arises, as in previous national immunization efforts. 
Vergeire earlier said the deployment of vaccines requiring ultra low cold storage of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will be limited to highly-urbanized areas such as Metro Manila, the cities of Cebu and Davao, and some parts of Central Luzon and Calabarzon since these are the only areas equipped with ultra low storage facilities. 
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. for his part, assured the public that the country will be securing 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from seven vaccine makers so far, namely, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Novovax, Johnson and Johnson, Gamaleya and Bharat BioTech. 
Only Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration so far. The FDA found it 95% and 92% effective on study population and among all races, respectively—a requirement before a vaccine can be administered in the country.

Senator Sherwin Gatchalian also stressed it is imperative that a budget is allocated for the COVID-19 vaccine in Congress' deliberations on the 2021 General Appropriations Act.
""My own estimate we will be needing approximately 230 billion to buy 100 million vaccines,"" he said.
""We have to be ready with the money to buy because it’s important that we have the financial capability to buy the vaccine in case it comes already,"" he added.
The Philippines has yet to enter into a final agreement when it comes to the number of anti-COVID-19 vaccines that will be available to Filipinos, according to the Department of Health.

The Food and Drug Administration is expected to exercise rigor in approving COVID-19 vaccines that will be given to Filipinos, according to Villanueva.
Citing information from the World Health Organization, the senator said six vaccines are in the third phase of clinical trials.
""Not to be overly optimistic, we wish that there will be transparency in the experimental results of these vaccines,"" he said.
""We know the urgency to have a vaccine as soon as possible but there are risks attached to fast-tracking the development of vaccines that normally takes 10 years to produce,"" he added.
Senator Nancy Binay also said the DOH should learn from the Dengvaxia experience.

The study, backed by the US government, involves about 1,000 adults.
The results were published on the medical website medRxiv in advance of peer review.
Of the several hundred participants with data available for the interim analysis, the results showed that 98% had neutralizing antibodies, which defend cells from pathogens, 29 days after vaccination.
However, immune response results were available from only 15 participants over age 65, leaving open the question of whether elderly people, one of the populations most at risk, will be protected as effectively as others.

The researchers said more details on safety and effectiveness will follow when the study is completed.
But there were no serious side effects, and based on the results so far, J&J kicked off a 60,000-person trial of the vaccine on Wednesday.
A single shot, versus a rival two-dose approach being tested by Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, could simplify distribution of the vaccine.
COVID-19 burden on US minorities extends to children
Minority groups in the United States are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and the disparities extend to children, doctors in Washington reported Thursday in the journal Pediatrics.
In March and April, they tested 1,000 children for the novel coronavirus.
Overall, roughly one in five children tested positive.
But while 7% of white children tested positive, 30% of Black children and 46% of Hispanic children did so.
After accounting for age, sex and family income, compared to white children, Black children had more than twice the odds of a positive COVID-19 test, and Hispanic had more than six times the odds.
Black and Hispanic children were also far more likely to have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.
The study could not identify causes of these disparities.
But study co-author Monika Goyal of Children's National Health System in Washington told Reuters the differences ""appear to be driven by greater exposure to the virus. There's nothing to indicate any type of genetic predisposition to COVID-19 based on race or ethnicity.""
In many minority families, parents or caregivers may not have the luxury of telecommuting or staying home from work if they are sick, Goyal said, adding, ""Our societal structures and policies that differentially impact communities based on economic and racial/ethnic lines in turn impact health outcomes.

Interviewed on Super Radyo dzBB, Domingo said the regulatory enforcement unit has yet to submit a report but pointed out they are looking into more details about the vaccination.
“Gusto ko po talaga malaman 'yung detalye kung paano po ang nangyari,” said Domingo, also undersecretary of the Department of Health.
“Saan ba nanggaling ang bakuna? Kung ano ba 'yung assurance natin na totoong bakuna 'yun at na-handle siya properly bago itinurok sa mga, allegedly, sundalo,” he added

“Dahil ang Army po ang mismong nagsabi, na ito pong head ng Philippine Army is mukhang nagsabi na merong nabakunahan so at least siya po maaari naming hingan ng impormasyon tsaka sa PSG,” he said.
Asked about Cabinet members who allegedly received the vaccine as claimed by Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, Domingo said he is not privy about it.
Domingo said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also does not know who among the Cabinet officials have received the vaccine, and that he is not one of them.
On Saturday, President Rodrigo Duterte said some military personnel have already received a COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer Sinopharm, which has no approval yet from the FDA.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines, after an internal inquiry, said those who received the vaccine were members of the Presidential Security Group.
Domingo said Sinopharm has yet to contact the FDA regarding possible application.
“Ang Sinopharm po kasi hindi pa lumalapit sa FDA. Wala pa po silang application na kahit ano dito sa Pilipinas tapos wala po silang representative dito sa Pilipinas,” he said.
Domingo added that the FDA will try to communicate with the Chinese manufacturer through the Chinese Embassy.
Domingo also said he finds it shocking than an unregulated vaccine has been reportedly used on military personnel and Cabinet members.
“Ito naman po ay ginagawa kasi natin to assure 'yung safety and quality po ng bakuna na gagamitin o ng gamot,” he said.
“Kaya nga po nakakagulat naman na may nangyaring ganoon na hindi man lang natin po nalaman sana man lang nasigurado po natin na na-handle properly and that it goes through a proper mean,” he added.
Domingo said the process of acquiring the vaccine could have been made legal only if the manufacturer applied for a “compassionate special permit,” which is issued to medicines for emergency and research purposes.

Teresita Ang See, a Chinese-Filipino, said the vaccinations started as early as November last year but she had no idea how the Chinese-developed vaccine was brought into the Philippines.
She said most of the Chinese nationals who received the vaccine work for Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).
“Okay lang sa akin na mabakunahan sila because we don’t have much control [over] them. Wala tayong basis to touch base with them, especially the POGO workers,” Ang See said on Tapatan sa Aristocrat forum.

Ang See said these Chinese nationals had confidence in the vaccine.

“Kung totoo man eh di mabuti. [We have] 100,000 less possible carriers of COVID-19,” he said.

“Kaming mga 70 [years old], we have to be careful. Ako naman, may doctor akong sarili. She thinks that another brand, I would not mention it... 'Yun nalang ang hinihintay nya and hinihintay ko,” the President, who is turning 76 next month, said in a press briefing.
[Translation: For 70-year-olds like us, we have to be careful. I have a doctor who thinks I should be injected with another brand, but I won’t mention the name. That’s what she and I are waiting for.]
The briefing came after the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac, which were donated by the Chinese government. Earlier, the Food and Drug Administration said Sinovac is not the most ideal for senior citizens, as well as healthcare workers constantly exposed to the virus, due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4%. But Health spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire later said that while clinical trials show lower efficacy in preventing mild symptoms, CoronaVac is still 100% effective against moderate and severe symptoms.
""In the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage... No doubt about it,"" Duterte added. ""As to what brand, ‘yan ang problema [that's the problem], because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor.""
The President said his doctor is eyeing another ""Chinese brand."" While it is not clear if this is Sinopharm, he earlier expressed preference for the particular pharmaceutical firm. Sinopharm vaccine has also been administered to his security detail and allegedly to other high-ranking government officials despite the absence of regulatory approval in the country.

Sinovac 'guaranteed safe and effective’
Despite not planning to receive it himself, Duterte has guaranteed the safety and effectiveness of Sinovac vaccines. His reassurance comes in the heels of hesitancy, especially among healthcare workers who are first in line in the national immunization program.
“To my fellow Filipinos, please set your fears aside. These vaccines are backed by science and deliberated by Filipino experts,” he said in a speech during the turnover ceremony. However, he also later on said he will not force those who are not comfortable to be inoculated with them.
The President defended last month the government’s preference for vaccines produced in China, saying that they are as good as those made by American and European pharmaceutical companies.
Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque advised the public to take whatever COVID-19 vaccine is available as soon as possible.
“Uulitin ko lang po ang mga sinabi ng mga experts. Ang pinakamagaling na bakuna ay ang nariyan na at maaari nang gamitin,” said Roque.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/2/4/covid-vaccines-development-hit-critical-mass.html,Development of new coronavirus vaccines may be hitting critical mass. Here's how they work,Maggie Fox,"Feb 4, 2021 4:42:29 AM","(CNN) -- Data on vaccines being tested by Johnson & Johnson and Novavax came out last week, and makers of AstraZeneca's vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine published some long-awaited details about their shots on Tuesday.
All indicate high efficacy against the virus, even though they take very different approaches.
Here's how some of the top coronavirus vaccines and vaccine candidates work.
Pfizer/BioNTech
Pfizer and its German-based partner BioNTech use a new approach to making vaccines that uses messenger RNA or mRNA.
ADVERTISEMENT
This design was chosen for a pandemic vaccine years ago because it's one that lends itself to quick turnaround. All that is needed is the genetic sequence of the virus causing the pandemic. Vaccine makers don't even need the virus itself -- just the sequence.
In this case, BioNTech researchers used a little piece of genetic material coding for a piece of the spike protein -- those studs that cover the surface of the coronavirus and the source of its name. Corona means ""crown.""
Messenger RNA is a single strand of the genetic code that cells can ""read"" and use to make a protein. In the case of this vaccine, the mRNA instructs the muscle cells in the arm to make a particular piece of the virus's spike protein called the receptor binding domain. Then the immune system sees it, recognizes it as foreign and is prepared to attack when actual infection occurs.
""RNA is like snapchat messages that expire. RNA vaccines do NOT become a permanent part of your body. They are temporary messages instructing cells to make one viral protein temporarily,"" Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, said on Twitter.
""It takes 25 different coronavirus proteins to make a coronavirus, so there is no worry about the RNA making a virus.""
Clinical trials showed Pfizer's vaccine was 95% effective in preventing symptomatic infections. Pfizer is working to show the vaccine can prevent all infections, including those that don't cause symptoms. It has also been testing its vaccine against some of the worrying new variants of coronavirus. So far, the studies indicate the vaccine can protect against variants causing concern in South Africa and the UK.
MRNA is very fragile so it's encased in lipid nanoparticles -- a coating of a buttery substance that can melt at room temperature. That's why Pfizer's vaccine must be kept at ultracold temperatures of about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 75 degrees Celsius). That means special equipment is needed to transport and store this vaccine.
Pfizer's vaccine won FDA EUA in December and is being delivered to millions of people in the US and UK. The US government has contracted to buy 300 million doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.
Side-effects from vaccination are rare and usually mild. They include fever and headache, although a very few people have experienced allergic reactions to the vaccine. It's not clear what causes the allergic reaction, and the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating.
Moderna
Moderna's vaccine is also based on mRNA. ""mRNA is like software for the cell,"" Moderna said on its website.
And like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, it codes for cells to make a piece of the spike protein.
The Moderna vaccine also goes into the muscle cells of the arm, and perhaps to nearby immune system cells, and instructs them to make pieces of spike protein.
Clinical trials showed Moderna's vaccine was 94% effective in preventing symptomatic infections and the company says it has data showing the vaccine also prevents all infections, including those that do not cause symptoms.
Moderna thinks its vaccine will protect against the coronavirus for at least a year
Moderna has come up with a different formulation for the lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA in its vaccine. These formulations are corporate secrets, but Moderna thinks its approach is better and said its vaccine can be shipped at minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 degrees F) and can be kept stable for 30 days at 2 degrees to 8 degrees C (36 to 46F), the temperature of a standard home refrigerator.
The FDA authorized Moderna's vaccine in December. The US government has contracted to purchase 200 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, and is in talks to purchase another 100 million doses.
Johnson & Johnson's vaccine arm, Janssen Pharmaceuticals
Janssen's coronavirus vaccine is a recombinant vector vaccine. It uses a genetically engineered version of adenovirus 26, which can cause the common cold, but the gene tinkering has disabled it. It also delivers the genetic instructions to make a piece of spike protein.
This is one vaccine that has been tested on the market before. The adenovirus 26 vector was used to make the company's Ebola vaccine, which won marketing authorization from the European Commission in July.
It's the only vaccine tested as a single shot -- a significant advantage in a world complicated by the need to ensure people get two carefully spaced doses of vaccine. Plus, it can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.
Preliminary data released last week showed the vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, but 72% effective in the US trial. Plus, it was 85% effective in preventing severe disease, and almost completely effective in preventing death.
""A vaccine that's inexpensive, that's a single dose, and that has no cold chain requirements -- that's pretty good,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.
Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply for emergency use authorization this week. The company said expects to supply 100 million vaccine doses to the US government in the first half of 2021.
The company is also testing a two-dose regimen in volunteers to see if adding a second dose gives better or longer-lasting protection.
AstraZeneca
AstraZeneca's vaccine, made with a team at Britain's University of Oxford, is, like Janssen's, a vector vaccine. It uses an adenovirus that infects chimpanzees, but doesn't make people sick, to carry the spike protein from the coronavirus into cells.
It was modified so that it doesn't replicate itself, then genetically engineered to inject cells with the DNA encoding for the full coronavirus spike protein.
It's a cheaper way to make vaccines -- but slower than using RNA. The company has pledged to make its vaccine available inexpensively to countries around the world. The vaccine can be kept stable for six months at standard refrigerator temperatures, the company said.
It's approved in Britain but the US FDA is waiting for data from US trials.
Data released from trials in Britain, South Africa and Brazil in a Lancet preprint Tuesday indicated it's about 67% effective at preventing symptomatic infection two weeks after two doses. But the Oxford team also tested some volunteers to see if they became infected at all, and said they think the vaccine prevents infections in general.
Plus, the studies indicated a single dose of vaccine prevented 76% of symptomatic infections for up to 90 days, and if more time passed between the first and second doses, the efficacy improved. When volunteers waited 12 weeks between doses, the vaccine's efficacy went up to 82%. A longer wait between doses would help get more people vaccinated, since the companies are struggling to keep up with demand.
Novavax
Maryland-based biotechnology company Novavax specializes in ""protein subunit"" vaccines. They use virus-like nanoparticles as a base and cover them with genetically engineered pieces of the coronavirus spike protein.
This is also a tried and true vaccine approach. A hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns is a protein subunit vaccine, as is the human papillomavirus or HPV vaccine and FluBlok, Sanofi's influenza vaccine.
Novavax uses an insect virus called a baculovirus to get the coronavirus spike protein into moth cells, which then produce the protein. This is harvested and mixed with an adjuvant -- an immune booster --based on saponin, found in soap bark trees.
A Phase 3 trial conducted in the UK showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 89%, the company said last week. It has not published any data yet, but announced results in a news release. The vaccine was found to have 95.6% efficacy against the original novel coronavirus and 85.6% against the variant first identified in the UK, known as B.1.1.7.
And a Phase 2b study conducted in South Africa indicated the vaccine was 60% effective against a variant circulating there and known as B.1.351 -- although efficacy went down if HIV-positive volunteers were included.
Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline
This is also a protein subunit vaccine, using Sanofi's FluBlok technology with a GlaxoSmithKline adjuvant. It also uses a baculovirus to grow little bits of spike protein.
Phase 1/2 trials showed the vaccine elicits an immune response in younger adults that's comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19, but the vaccine did not produce the desired immune response in older adults. The companies plan to launch a new trial in February.
Sinovac and Sinopharm
Chinese company Sinovac's CoronaVac uses an inactivated virus -- one of the oldest methods for vaccinating people. Whole batches of coronavirus are grown, ""killed"" and then made into vaccine. Likewise, Sinopharm's vaccine uses an inactivated virus.
China's Center for Disease Control said this week that tests showed the Sinopharm vaccine was effective against the B.1.351 variant.
Sputnik V
Russian researchers were heavily criticized for rolling out the Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine last year without providing any data to show it was safe or effective.
On Tuesday, interim data from a Phase 3 trial were finally published in the Lancet medical journal and showed the vaccine is 91.6% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100% effective for preventing severe illness.
The vaccine is a two-dose adenoviral vector vaccine, with doses administered 21 days apart. It uses two common cold viruses called adenovirus 5 and adenovirus 26 to carry the genetic material for the spike protein into the body.

China and Russia say they will start deploying vaccines before completing late-stage clinical trials, and US Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn has said if the US gets enough data from advanced trials, it might be possible to authorize a vaccine before the trials are completed.
Asked about what the three countries are planning, WHO officials said it’s important to make sure a vaccine is at least safe and works before using one broadly.
“The emergency use authorization or licensing is something that has to be done with a great deal of seriousness and reflection. It’s not something that you do very lightly,” WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said during a news briefing.

While it is up to the national regulatory authority of every country to make decisions about approvals, WHO has on its website a guidance document that lays out step-by-step what the approach for their emergency use listing procedure would be, she said.
Any country’s vaccine policy “must be guided by the highest possible ethical standard, the highest possible scientific standards,” said Dr. Mike Ryan, director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Program.
There are examples of vaccines that were rolled out before data collection was complete, Ryan added. Ebola is one. But data was carefully collected even as groups rushed to vaccinate people during recent Ebola outbreaks.
“You need to maintain monitoring,” Ryan said.

Duterte expounded that Robredo is creating uncertainty and doubt among people about the effectiveness of Sinovac, the first COVID-19 vaccine brand to arrive in the country last February 28. An initial batch of 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government and military arrived on that day.
""Instead of helping, the Vice President muddled up everything, thereby I said creating uncertainty and doubt in the minds of the people. I hope next time, if she has nothing good to say, she should just maybe shut up… I did not get irritated. I got angry at you because I said, what is this? Time is running out to convince people,"" said Duterte.
The President responded to the Vice President's remark in an online show interview where she said Duterte was short-tempered. It was Robredo's response to Duterte's comment on his public address last week that she should ""bring a basket"" and shop for vaccines.

Duterte got irked by Robredo's backing of some health workers who pleaded to the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) to review the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.
HTAC was created under the Universal Health Care Law to review the cost and ethical and community impact of health technologies that will be introduced to the public. Included for review are medicines, vaccines, and health devices.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque, who co-authored the law, clarified that under the measure, the health technology assessment process is only recommendatory to the Department of Health and Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.

No serious adverse effects have been reported from vaccine recipients so far, Sinopharm said Wednesday in an article on social media platform WeChat, citing Chairman Liu Jingzhen.
""In emergency use, we now have used it on nearly a million people. We have not received any reports of serious adverse reaction, and only a few have some mild symptoms,"" Liu said.
Liu said the vaccine had been given to Chinese construction workers, diplomats, and students who have gone to more than 150 countries around the world during the pandemic -- and none of them has reported an infection.
He said on November 6 that there were 56,000 people who had received emergency vaccinations and then gone overseas.
""For example, a transnational company has 99 employees in one of its overseas offices, of whom 81 were vaccinated. And later, an outbreak broke out in the office, 10 of the 18 people who were not vaccinated were infected and none of those vaccinated were infected,"" he said.
He said that separately, Sinopharm had carried out Phase 3 clinical trials involving almost 60,000 people in 10 countries -- including the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru, and Argentina. CNN has not seen the results of these trials yet.
Sinopharm has two vaccine candidates. It's unclear which vaccine Liu referred to.
Beijing has granted approval to companies for urgent vaccinations using experimental drugs for months. In June, Chinese company CanSino Biologics announced it had been given special authorization to administer its experimental vaccine to the People's Liberation Army.
Since July, Chinese drug makers have been administering experimental vaccines to people working in ""high-risk"" professions under the emergency use program, which allows vaccine candidates to be used on a limited scale before their safety and efficacy have been fully proven by clinical trials.
Experimental coronavirus vaccines have even been reportedly offered to the public in parts of China, causing some citizens to rush across the country to get their hands on a dose.
It comes after Pfizer announced the results of its Phase 3 coronavirus vaccine trials on Wednesday, which it said was 95% effective in preventing infections -- even in older adults -- and caused no serious safety concerns. A day earlier, Moderna announced that its coronavirus vaccine was 94.5% effective.
Pfizer is expected to seek US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization for its vaccine Friday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert, said the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had shown extraordinary efficacy.
""That is extraordinary,"" Fauci said. ""That is almost to the level of what we see with measles (vaccine), which is 98% effective.""

Government officials previously announced that the first batch of vaccines to be supplied by the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility may arrive by the middle of February. However, the delivery got delayed due to the absence of an indemnification deal— which Galvez earlier confirmed was already submitted to the concerned manufacturers, Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
Galvez also pointed out the “difficult” situation with regard to the market supply and demand for the vaccines, saying other countries have also been struggling in getting their doses. He cited the reported “uneven” distribution of the products.

It's the first state in the US to remove nearly every eligibility requirement for the Covid-19 vaccine -- a milestone possible, the state's chief medical officer said, because of the state's success in vaccinating vulnerable Alaskans.
""Soon this virus will be a preventable disease, if people choose to get vaccinated,"" said Dr. Anne Zink of Alaska's Department of Health and Social Services in a Tuesday news conference. ""This is our shot to end the pandemic.""
Starting this week, Alaskans ages 16 and up can make an appointment to receive the Pfizer vaccine. The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are available to residents 18 years and older.
ADVERTISEMENT
Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who tested positive for Covid-19 last month, said in a statement that the milestone ""should come as no surprise"" given the cooperation of state residents and an enviably smooth vaccine rollout.
How Alaska is getting vaccinations right
Alaska has consistently ranked among the top states in percentage of residents vaccinated, according to CNN's Covid-19 vaccine tracker. About 41 vaccine doses have been administered for every 100 residents, and over 16% of the state's population has been fully vaccinated.
The state's robust public health system -- and experience in distributing vaccines to the far reaches of the massive state -- had equipped it for a successful vaccine rollout, Zink told CNN last week. And the state's 229 sovereign tribes received their own vaccine allocations, which relieved some of the pressure off the state to provide for all 730,000-plus residents.
Even before Tuesday's announcement, Alaska's vaccine eligibility had already expanded to include essential workers, residents of multigenerational housing and young people who accompanied seniors to their vaccination appointment, a strategy that Zink and officials from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium said addressed the disproportionate death rates among low-income residents and Alaska Natives.
The state currently has 430,685 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine -- not enough to vaccinate the entire state within a few weeks.
""We know we don't have enough vaccine in the state of Alaska to do everyone tonight,"" Zink said. ""But even if you're thinking about it, let (the state's Covid-19 helpline) know, and they can help connect you to an appointment if appointments become filled quickly as more vaccine comes into the state.""
Appointments for vaccines will likely fill up quickly, Zink said in the news conference, but more will become available as soon as the state gets its monthly vaccine allotment.

""What we're saying is that the UK should adopt this best practice based on international professional opinion,"" BMA chairman Dr. Chaand Nagpaul told the BBC on Saturday. The organization has sent a letter to the UK's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, warning against the delay.
""Most nations in the world are facing challenges similar to the UK, in having limited vaccine supply and also wanting to protect their population maximally,"" Nagpaul added. ""No other nation has adopted the UK's approach.""
In a statement to CNN, a BMA spokesperson said the letter informs Whitty of ""the growing concern from the medical profession regarding the delay of the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as the UK's strategy has become increasingly isolated from many other countries.""

The group told CNN they were also concerned about the availability of the vaccine in the coming weeks, saying their members feel that ""given the unpredictability of supplies, there may not be any guarantees that second doses of the Pfizer vaccine will be available in 12 weeks' time.""
""The Association is urging the (Chief Medical Officer) to urgently review the UK's current position of second doses after 12 weeks,"" they said.
Britain is vaccinating its citizens at one of the quickest rates in the world, thanks partly to its spread-out dosing strategy. More than 5 million Brits have received at least one dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, and more than 400,000 people are receiving the jab on a daily basis.
Public Health England's medical director Yvonne Doyle defended the plan, telling the BBC on Saturday it was necessary to bring the virus under control.
""The more people that are protected against this virus, the less opportunity it has to get the upper hand. Protecting more people is the right thing to do,"" she said.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been in use in the UK since early December, when it became the first country in the world to approve it.
When Britain first announced its plans, Pfizer said it did not have data to demonstrate that just a single dose of its vaccine would provide protection against the disease after more than 21 days.
""Pfizer and BioNTech's Phase 3 study for the Covid-19 vaccine was designed to evaluate the vaccine's safety and efficacy following a 2-dose schedule, separated by 21 days,"" Pfizer said in a statement last month. ""There are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.""
But the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland explained the move in a letter to health care professionals after the vaccine was approved, saying it was based on the ""balance of risks and benefits,"" and that the ""great majority"" of initial protection came from the first jab.
The debate comes as Covid-19 deaths soar in the UK. While new cases are declining since Britain went into a third lockdown this month, the country reported its highest-ever daily fatality toll on Wednesday, with 1,820 deaths, giving a total of 97,517, according to John Hopkins University.

Two doses of the vaccine “is expected to be protective against emerging strains detected to date,” according to the release.
The company’s study showed that the variant first found in the UK had “no significant impact” on the vaccine’s effectiveness.
The results for the variant first spotted in South Africa, however, were not as optimistic — and some early studies have suggested vaccines may be somewhat less effective against this strain.

In the press release, Moderna noted that “a six-fold reduction in neutralizing titers was observed with (the variant discovered in South Africa) relative to prior variants.”
The company said the vaccine was still expected to be effective.
“Despite this reduction, neutralizing titer levels with (the variant discovered in South Africa) remain above levels that are expected to be protective,” according to the press release.
David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center, said while he’s “cautiously optimistic” Moderna’s vaccine will work well against this strain, he’s still not sure.
“The efficacy might be reduced somewhat, but it may still be very effective,” he said. “Hopefully the vaccine will still be 70-80% effective.”
The variant first identified in the UK has also appeared in more than 45 other countries, including 195 cases in the US.
The variant first identified in South Africa has appeared in more than 20 other countries. No cases have been identified in the US, but experts say it’s likely there are cases and US surveillance, which has been widely criticized, has not yet found them.

In a statement on Sunday, Duque said he is willing to be inoculated, but only after the vaccines have been evaluated.
""Sure, I will have myself vaccinated once the Vaccine Expert Panel of the DOST and FDA's regulatory and technical evaluation determine the safety quality and effectiveness of the vaccines,"" Duque said.
Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go previously dared Duque and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. to take the first shots to encourage Filipinos to avail of the coronavirus vaccines once they become ready for rollout next year. Galvez has yet to reply to Go's call.
On her Sunday radio show, Vice President Leni Robredo said she would agree to be one of the first in line for the vaccine, but believes officials should be willing to take the challenge with the proper intention.

The government has already listed health care workers as the first group that will be inoculated with the COVID-19 vaccine. Robredo also previously suggested that the first recipients should be specifically named to avoid delays and other hurdles.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/12/22/COVID-19-vaccine-myths.html,The most common COVID vaccine myths explored,Maggie Fox,"Dec 22, 2020 10:15:51 AM","(CNN) – How could the COVID-19 vaccine possibly be safe if it was produced, tested and authorized in record time? How can we trust anything backed by this administration?
Vaccines, especially, attracts myths and rumors and coronavirus vaccines seems to be fiction magnets.
Here are a few of the more common ones:
The COVID-19 vaccines were too rushed. We cannot know if they are safe.
It's true the vaccines being produced against coronavirus were created in record time. But that's not because they were rushed. It's because of careful preparation. The technology that underlies both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines -- the first two to get through the US regulatory process -- has been in the works for more than a decade and was made precisely for a pandemic situation.
This plug-and-play technology needs only the genetic code of a new virus, and that was available just days after the new coronavirus was identified and isolated.
Vaccines are usually slow to develop because -- contrary to popular belief -- they are not big money makers for pharmaceutical companies, so production doesn't ramp up unless there is a guaranteed market. In this case, the United States government paid billions up front so the companies would feel secure in going ahead and making vaccines at the same time they started the months-long process of clinical trials.
These trials went speedily because of the pandemic itself. So many people were getting infected across the country that it did not take long at all to tell whether the vaccine could protect people from infection. In addition, the hospitals and academic labs that did the testing sped up their own processes, fling paperwork daily, for instance, instead of waiting for weeks to file it in batches. And the US Food and Drug Administration scientists who reviewed the data worked seven days a week to review the information, dropping everything else to speed along their decisions.
ADVERTISEMENT
The companies themselves submit to outside experts called Data and Safety Monitoring Boards while the trials are ongoing.
Finally, the review was subject to outside eyes. The FDA submitted all the data to the independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, a group of mostly non-government, non-industry experts who reviewed the data. They overwhelmingly voted that both the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna vaccines are as effective and as safe as the companies who made them say they are.
Anyone who wants to can see the data. It's posted online, and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine for any expert to review and critique.
People who have allergies can't get the vaccines
It's true that people who have allergies to the specific ingredients in these vaccines should not get them. But that is a pretty short list, and might include ingredients such as polyethylene glycol. 
Old-fashioned flu vaccines are grown in eggs and some people with egg allergies were warned against getting some flu vaccine formulations -- but even flu vaccines have been reformulated in recent years and many are egg-free. The coronavirus vaccines are not made using eggs. They also do not contain preservatives that might trigger allergies.
""Honestly, anaphylaxis and other serious allergic reactions are considered a potential risk with every licensed vaccine,"" said Dr. Elissa Malkin, assistant research professor of Medicine at the George Washington University and a co-investigator on the Moderna vaccine clinical trial at GW.
""It is not surprising that as more people get vaccinated that allergic reactions would appear. We expect them to be uncommon and rare,"" Malkin told CNN.
No allergic reactions were seen in the clinical trials of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which involved just under 80,000 people. As they are rolled out among millions of people, more are likely to be seen, however.
One health worker who suffered an allergic reaction in Fairbanks, Alaska on Friday issued a statement saying she would be vaccinated again. ""Anaphylaxis is a rare but expected potential side effect that is treatable and does not have long term health implications like Covid,"" she said.
I would get the vaccine and recommend it to anyone, despite my reaction,"" she added.
""I've seen firsthand the suffering and death of COVID patients and my adverse reaction to the vaccine pales to what Covid infection can do to people.""
The vaccine will permanently change your DNA
This rumor may have started because the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both use genetic material. But they don't change DNA. They use RNA, which doesn't hang around in the body.
Former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Tom Frieden came up with this analogy:
""An mRNA vaccine doesn't actually contain the virus itself. Think of it as an email sent to your immune system that shows what the virus looks like, instructions to kill it, and then—like a Snapchat message—it disappears. Amazing technology,"" Frieden tweeted.
The vaccine is more dangerous than COVID-19
Brown University emergency room doctor Dr. Megan Ranney took this one on. She noted that at least 1% of people who catch coronavirus die of it. ""Another 10-20% are hospitalized. Another 30% or more have long lasting symptoms. The vaccine is far safer, with only minor temporary side effects,"" Ranney said on Twitter.
In both Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine trials, no worrying side-effects were seen. Covid-19 has killed more than 313,000 Americans -- more than 1.67 million people globally, according to Johns Hopkins University.
Coronavirus is just a myth
If it's a conspiracy, it's a good one. Tens of thousands of doctors and nurses around the world must be colluding in this lie. Every single government, the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the CDC and countless other organizations must be in on it.
Media organizations big and small must be in on this conspiracy and users of social media around the world must also be deciding to lie as they post pictures of their own suffering and that of loved ones who have suffered from this virus and been killed by it.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/12/13/bill-gates-presidential-transition-covid-vaccine.html,Bill Gates says presidential transition is 'complicating' US efforts to distribute vaccine,Veronica Stracqualursi,"Dec 13, 2020 11:33:21 PM","(CNN) -- Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose foundation has been part of the effort to develop and deliver Covid-19 vaccines, said Sunday that the presidential transition is ""complicating"" efforts to distribute one, but that he's spoken with President-elect Joe Biden to ensure the US doesn't ""blow it"" again.
""The transition is complicating, but the new administration is willing to rely on actual experts and not attack those experts,"" Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on ""State of the Union.""
President Donald Trump has refused to concede the 2020 election to Biden and has not coordinated with the President-elect on the Covid-19 vaccine candidates and the massively complex distribution operation. Biden has said that the Trump administration had shared information -- but not a ""detailed plan"" -- with his transition team about the nationwide distribution of a vaccine.
In his interview with Tapper, Gates praised Biden's incoming administration for ""laying out clear plans"" to slow the spread of Covid-19, adding that ""I think we'll get through this in a positive way.""
""You know I'm pleased with the people and the priority that President-elect Biden and his team are bringing to bear on this problem,"" he said.
The Gates Foundation on Thursday said it plans to commit an additional $250 million to support the ""research, development and equitable delivery"" of tools to fight Covid-19, including tests, treatments and vaccines. The announcement brings the group's total commitments to the global Covid-19 response to $1.75 billion.
Gates lauded Biden for ""doing his best to retain"" Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who Gates said would be ""willing to admit when things aren't going well"" and ""deliver tough messages.""
""I do think the US will not be one of the worst performers, as the (Biden) team comes into office,"" he added.
The United States is the nation with the most cases and deaths from Covid-19. As of Sunday morning, the US had reported more than 16 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 300,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Gates noted in his interview that the US ""would've been expected to be the best"" when it came to the pandemic given its federal health agencies and various technologies, but ""sadly ... we didn't get on top of it like many countries did,"" adding that future post-mortems on the crisis ""will guide us.""
Biden has laid out a three-point plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including aiming to distribute 100 million vaccine shots in his initial 100 days in office. Biden also told Tapper in an interview earlier this month, that he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office.
During his interview with Tapper, Gates confirmed that he has spoke with Biden about the pandemic.
The price to pay each year ""to avoid, you know, a trillions of dollars disaster -- I think that roadmap's clear, and I talked with the President-elect about that. And you know, I think our foundation will be part of that dialogue to make sure we don't blow it again,"" Gates said.
The US is close to a vaccine as the Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued an emergency use authorizaton for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine. And the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted on Saturday to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for people ages 16 and older, moving the US another step closer to being able to inoculate millions of its citizens.
Gates told Tapper that distribution ""should be based on medical need, not wealth at all.""
""After all, this epidemic has been awful in the way that it's exacerbated inequities,"" he said.
Gates also said he is ""super happy with all of these vaccines"" and that when it's his turn for vaccination, ""I will visibly take the vaccine. Because I think that it's a benefit to all people to not be transmitting.""

Tender, swollen lumps developed under her left armpit, along with a large swelling above her collarbone -- all areas where the body has lymph nodes, the body's filters for germs.

""You have lymph nodes above and below your collarbone,"" Quasha said. ""You don't want to feel those. It was scary when I felt it.""
Lymph nodes contain immune cells that help fight invaders. That's why it made sense to Quasha that the nodes were reacting to the vaccine, building antibodies as they were designed to do. But she couldn't be sure.
The swelling was only on the left side where she had gotten the shot -- the same side as the worrisome lump. Was it a reaction to the vaccine or another sign of breast cancer?
'It was like a wildfire'
After the ultrasound, Quasha's radiologist was concerned. She told Quasha she considered the lump she had felt in her breast to be of little significance, but the lymph nodes that showed up as white blobs on her mammogram were another matter.
In non-pandemic times, that finding would set off alarm bells, requiring the need for further investigation, even an immediate biopsy. Yet Quasha had just had the vaccine. After talking it over with her, Quasha said her doctor decided not to do a biopsy at that time. Instead she told Quasha to come back for a follow-up ultrasound in six weeks.
Similar scenarios had been happening in mammogram centers around the country. As radiologists compared notes with colleagues, word began to spread.
""We all started talking about it, and it was like a wildfire,"" said Dr. Connie Lehman, chief of breast imaging in Massachusetts General's department of radiology.
""I cannot tell you how many women are showing nodes on mammograms and people thought it was going to be not that common,"" said Lehman, who is also a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School.
Tales of unnecessary biopsies spurred the patient care committee of the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) to put out an advisory in January: Ask your patients about their COVID-19 status, and record the date and which arm received the vaccine. Consider that before automatically scheduling a biopsy.
""We wanted to advocate that women don't always need to have a biopsy,"" said Dr. Lars Grimm, associate professor of radiology at Duke University School of Medicine and one of the authors of the SBI advisory. ""Because oftentimes the default if you see swollen lymph nodes in a patient would actually be to recommend doing a biopsy.""
Mass General's Lehman agreed. ""When you hear hoofbeats, don't think zebra,"" she said. ""If a woman had a vaccine in the arm on the same side, and the lymph nodes are swollen, this is a normal biological response. It's totally expected. It just doesn't make sense to start imaging.""
That does not mean that women who wish to be sure about their cancer status cannot have a biopsy, Grimm stressed.
""You actually have some women who want to biopsy,"" he said. ""You might tell them, 'Hey, I think this is due to your Covid vaccine, and I'm sure that it's going to resolve in a few weeks on its own and you're going to be fine.' But that patient tells you, 'I'm not going to be comfortable waiting, I want to know now.' ""
Focus on screening to save lives
For Quasha, the knowledge that many women were experiencing the same type of reaction to the vaccine was a welcome relief from worry. After a discussion with her doctor, she said she no longer needs the follow-up screening.
""I was very reassured,"" Quasha said. ""The point here is that there are a number of side effects from the vaccine which are not dangerous but can sometimes increase patient anxiety.""
Instead of bringing women back in for an unnecessary ultrasound, radiology centers should be focused on scheduling women who have missed or are overdue on their mammogram, Lehman said.
""We need to take care of the large percentage of women who didn't get screened because of the shutdowns during Covid,"" she said. ""At Mass General alone, we failed to screen 15,000 women because of Covid, and we're still trying to get them back in.
""This isn't where I need to start doing axillary ultrasounds, because someone had a vaccine and the node swelled. It's just not being practical or pragmatic or putting our patient's needs first,"" she said.
It's not just breast cancer, Lehman stressed. Lymph nodes in other parts of the body are also reacting to the COVID-19 vaccines, causing people with other forms of cancer to undergo unnecessary procedures.
""There have been some false scares and some unnecessary biopsies because people didn't think to ask, and they assume that the node was the cancer coming back,"" she said.
What to do?
To avoid unnecessary worry, SBI recommends women schedule any routine, annual breast screening before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. If a woman has already had the vaccine, or is soon scheduled to do so, the society suggests waiting at least four to six weeks after the second dose before scheduling your appointment.
At Mass General, Lehman and her team have gone a step further. They are screening all women regardless of vaccine status, but telling those with no history of cancer that any swelling in the lymph nodes that might be connected to a COVID-19 vaccine is benign -- meaning not cancerous.
""This follows the American College of Radiology recommendations that if you have a known inflammatory cause you can say it's benign,"" said Lehman, who recently published a paper on the hospital's procedures.
""If their concern is a swelling or tenderness after the vaccine in their armpit, we suggest that they wait four to six weeks, talk to their doctor, and if it persists, then we have them come in to do an evaluation of it,"" she said.
Whatever you do, experts stress, don't skip getting your breast cancer screening when it is recommended. A study published Tuesday in the journal Radiology that followed over half a million women made the point clearly: Women who skip even one scheduled mammography screening before they are diagnosed with breast cancer have a significantly higher risk of dying.
In fact, the risk of having a fatal breast cancer within 10 years of diagnosis was 50% lower for women who had regular breast screenings, the study said.

While concerns were raised after over 20 died in Norway after receiving doses from US-based drugmaker Pfizer, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said he was quite optimistic the news would not further dampen vaccine confidence in the Philippines.
""I hope not,"" he told CNN Philippines in a text message, when asked if the news could affect Filipinos' trust in the vaccine.
""This shows that the vaccine recipients are being monitored closely and all events are investigated and recommendations are updated regularly,"" Domingo added.
Of the 2,400 Filipino adults surveyed by Pulse Asia last Nov. 23 to Dec. 2, 47 percent said they were not willing to get vaccinated against the virus due to safety concerns.
According to a Bloomberg report, the deaths among elderly people in Norway were linked to Pfizer's vaccine.
Quoting the Norwegian Medicines Agency, it said they ""have experienced the expected side effects of the vaccine, such as nausea and vomiting, fever, local reactions at the injection site, and worsening of their underlying condition.""

The government last week gave the go signal for the use of Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, the first one to be granted emergency use authorization in the Philippines. Pfizer boasts that its phase 3 clinical trials showed that the vaccine was 95 percent effective in preventing infections after a person received two shots.
The country has yet to secure vaccine procurement deals with the US pharmaceutical company, but vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government expects to receive more or less 40 million doses this year.
Domingo said the FDA was still waiting for Pfizer's reports before they decide whether to put an age cap on the recipients.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/1/29/johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine-efficacy.html,"Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is 66% effective in global trial, but 85% effective against severe disease, company says",Maggie Fox,"Jan 29, 2021 9:35:59 PM","(CNN) - Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 single-shot vaccine was shown to be 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, but 85% efficacy against severe disease, the company announced Friday.
The vaccine was 72% effective against moderate and severe disease in the US, the company said.
It's a striking difference from vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, and it may give pause to people uncertain about which vaccine to get or when they can get one. The vaccines already on the market in the US are about 95% effective overall against symptomatic COVID-19, with perhaps even higher efficacy against severe cases.
But experts say the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will still be useful against the pandemic in the United States and around the world.
""Among all participants from different geographies and including those infected with an emerging viral variant, Janssen's COVID-19 vaccine candidate was 66% effective overall at preventing the combined endpoints of moderate and severe COVID-19, 28 days after vaccination. The onset of protection was observed as early as day 14,"" the company said in a statement.
Janssen is Johnson & Johnson's vaccine arm.
ADVERTISEMENT
""The level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 infection was 72% in the US, 66% in Latin America and 57% in South Africa, 28 days post-vaccination.""
""We're 85% effective at preventing severe disease, which we define as disease that makes you feel particularly sick at home, or may go to the hospital, or worse,"" Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development at Johnson & Johnson, told CNN.
""And we are right now completely protective, it would appear 100% protective, against disease that actually does make you go to the hospital, we're 100% protective against death.""
The company said the results held up across all age groups and people of various ethnicities.
Mammen said the company was working to file for emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration ""inside of a week."" It will be the third company to seek EUA from the FDA for a coronavirus vaccine. Vaccines made by Moderna and by Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized in December and are now being given to millions of Americans.
Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said that under normal circumstances, there might not be much of a market for a vaccine that is significantly less effective than two others already on the market. But he added that these are not normal times, with a pandemic raging and shortage of vaccines.
Pfizer and Moderna both use genetic technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA technology. Johnson & Johnson uses a weakened common cold virus, known as adenovirus, to carry genetic instructions into the body to prompt an immune response.
""In a better world, we would have abundant quantities of this messenger RNA vaccine, Pfizer and Moderna, and that would be damning for a vaccine that's clearly less effective. But that said, we have limited quantities of mRNA vaccine,"" Offit said.
Offit has been vaccinated, but said if he had not, he would first search out a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, and then if he couldn't find one in reasonable period of time, he would take a Johnson & Johnson vaccine if it was available.Offit said getting one brand of vaccine and later on getting a different vaccine should not pose safety issues.
""I would make an effort to get an mRNA vaccine first,"" Offit said. ""Not being able to get it, and knowing I might not be able to get Pfizer or Moderna for many months, and knowing this virus is still ranging across the country, I would take J&J in the secure knowledge that I could get Pfizer or Moderna later.""
The Johnson & Johnson vaccine has advantages, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
""A vaccine that's inexpensive, that's a single dose, and that has no cold chain requirements -- that's pretty good,"" Fauci told CNN.
Plus no cases of severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis were seen in any of the volunteers, the company said.
Fauci said the results would look even better if Janssen did not have to compete against the 94% and 95% efficacy seen in trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
""You know what the problem is? If this were out there and we didn't have the Moderna 94-95% .... We would have said wow, a 72% effective vaccine that's even more effective against severe disease is really terrific,"" he said in a telephone interview.
""But now we're always judging it against 94 to 95%. Having said that, this is a vaccine that could have use particularly in developing countries to keep people out of the hospital. It has a very good efficacy against severe disease,"" Fauci added.
Mammen said the Janssen vaccine was tested later, after new variants of coronavirus were already circulating. One in particular, called B.1.135, was dominant in South Africa when the vaccine was tested there. This variant has mutations that might be expected to weaken the vaccine's effects somewhat.
But it still protected people, Mammen said.
""I'm looking at that South African variant, and I'm seeing that we're able to completely protect against concerning levels of illness, where one might go to a hospital,"" he said.
Plus people do not have to worry about coming back for a second dose.
""We really wanted it to be a single dose. So we optimized our antigen so that we get enough immunogenicity after one dose, as opposed to two,"" he said.
""If it's a single-dose vaccine, then a billion vaccine doses would translate into a billion people vaccinated,"" said Dr. Dan Barouch of Harvard Medical School, who helped develop the vaccine.
And, unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, it does not have to be stored in freezers. It can be stored for three months at refrigerator temperatures of 36 degrees to 46 degrees Fahrenheit.
Janssen is already testing a two-dose regimen of the vaccine and that could increase the efficacy, Fauci said.
""Let's see what that shows. It could possibly bring it up to 90%,"" he said. ""Heck if you got 72 with a single dose, you would think you would do pretty good with a boost.""
The US federal government has contracted to buy 100 million doses of the vaccine and the company has been manufacturing doses for months in anticipation that it would work and would win EUA from the FDA.
A fourth vaccine is also jostling to join the mix in the US market. Maryland-based Novavax released preliminary data Thursday showing its candidate vaccine had an efficacy of 89% in trials in Britain. And AstraZeneca is finishing up Phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine, as well.
The Janssen vaccine is made a little differently from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which use raw genetic material called messenger RNA.
This one is a viral vector vaccine. It uses a common cold virus called adenovirus 26, which has been weakened so that it does not replicate in the body. It's engineered to carry genetic material from the spike protein of the virus -- that's the part the virus uses to grab onto the cells it targets.
The vaccine prompts the muscle cells in the arm to produce these pieces of spike protein. The immune system recognizes them as foreign and builds a defense, so when a real virus tries to infect, the body is ready to fight it off.

The case is the first allergic reaction to the vaccine to be reported in the US, although health officials said they are expecting the occasional allergic reaction -- and are prepared to treat anyone suffering from one.
""We expected that a side effect like this could occur after reports of anaphylaxis were made in England after people there received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine,"" said Alaska's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink. ""All sites that are approved to provide vaccinations in Alaska must have medications on hand to deal with an allergic reaction and that was the case in Juneau.""
The worker was among staff being vaccinated at Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau as part of the rollout of Pfizer's vaccine across the country Tuesday.
According to Dr. Lindy Jones, an attending physician at Bartlett Memorial Hospital, the worker was initially held in the vaccine monitoring area right after receiving the shot, and took a Benadryl. When she reported shortness of breath, she was taken to the emergency room.
When Jones saw her in the hospital, he said she was experiencing shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate, and had developed a rash covering her face and torso.
""I was concerned about an anaphylactic reaction so gave her the standard treatment of a dose of intramuscular epinephrine and she responded immediately,"" Jones told a news briefing. She was also given antihistamines.
ADVERTISEMENT
She still had an elevated heart rate and was breathing fast -- a sign of an allergic reaction -- so Jones gave her another dose of epinephrine, as well as steroids ""which is another standard bread and butter treatment for adverse anaphylactic reactions,"" he said.
Jones said the worker, who was not further identified to protect her privacy, had no previous history of allergies to vaccines. She is almost recovered after a night in the intensive care unit.
""She was still enthusiastic that she got the vaccine and the benefits it would give her in the future,"" Jones said.
""This was an instance where the system worked very well,"" Dr. Jay Butler of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the news briefing.
""This incident was reported last night to the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. The State of Alaska Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) has been in close communication with the CDC, and the agency is providing guidance and support,"" the state health department said in a statement.
Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the US Food and Drug Administration's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, said on Wednesday that doctors will have to keep an eye out for allergic reactions to the new vaccine.
""It's the kind of thing that we're obviously going to need to look at,"" Offit told CNN's Brianna Keilar.
He noted there were two reported cases of allergic reaction in Britain, which rolled out the vaccine earlier this month.
""There were obviously several people in the United Kingdom who had had a severe allergic reaction to this vaccine and had a history of severe allergic reaction,"" said Offit, who is director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
""Currently, the CDC recommendation is that if you ever had a severe allergic reaction to an injectable medical product, you shouldn't get this vaccine,"" Offit added.
""About one out of every million people that get a vaccine can have a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine. What we need to find out is what specifically seems to be inducing this allergic reaction.""
An FDA spokeswoman said the agency was working with Pfizer and the CDC to better understand what happened.
""Importantly, the fact sheets to healthcare providers include language that severe allergic reactions have been reported following vaccination and that appropriate medical treatment used to manage immediate allergic reactions must be immediately available for administration of any individual in the event an acute anaphylactic reaction occurs,"" the spokeswoman told CNN.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. on Saturday disputed criticisms that the country is only ""focusing on new vaccines,"" primarily China's Sinovac Biotech whose product is said to be only deemed ""acceptable"" to the minimum global health standards despite questions on transparency.
RELATED: DOST: Despite 50% effectivity, PH still can't use Sinovac sans full data
During the meeting of the Inter-Agency Task Force on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases with President Rodrigo Duterte and health experts on Saturday, Galvez stressed that the country is also securing deals with America's Johnson & Johnson; British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca, Russia's Gamaleya Institute, and India's Novavax.
US-based drug manufacturer Pfizer has also applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its coronavirus vaccine in the country.
""So all in all, sir, if we will get Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, J&J, and also Moderna, we might have more or less 80 million doses."" Galvez reported to Duterte.
According to Galvez, AstraZeneca, which previously offered 6.2 million doses, will likely be the first to secure the deal. This will be followed by Novavax, Pfizer, then Johnson & Johnson.
""We have also the discussion of the head of terms and also the supply of agreement and also with Moderna; and then followed by Gamaleya and also the Sinovac,"" he added.
President Rodrigo Duterte bared during the meeting that some Filipinos, including military men, were already inoculated with another China-based vaccine, Sinopharm, even without any approval for its use in the country.
""Marami na ang nagpa-injection dito sa Sinopharm (A lot of people here were already injected with Sinopharm here),"" Duterte said.
Galvez reiterated that the country is conducting a ""stringent"" screening of vaccines, as prescribed by international institutions like World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and Asian Investment Infrastructure Bank, which offer loans for their procurement.
""Gusto po naming i-announce sa ating mga kababayan na iyong pinipili po natin na vaccine is very safe and very effective considering that they will follow our stringent procedures...and of our fund manager, iyong tinatawag nating procurement agents, which are ADB, the World Bank and the AIIB.""
[Translation: We would like to announce to the public that the vaccines that we choose are very safe and very effective considering that they will follow our stringent procedures...and of our fund manager,s the ones we call procurement agents which are ADB, the World Bank and the AIIB.]
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque previously defended the government's eagerness to secure 25 million doses of Sinovac, noting that they are the only ones who could provide supply ""at the soonest possible time.""
A few days ago, the government drew flak for claiming that Sinovac's vaccine is ""acceptable,"" and citing the World Health Organization's minimum threshold for effectivity. Brazilian researchers previously reported that Sinovac is just over 50% effective based on the country's recent trial data. However, full results of the trial have yet to be released.
Jaime Montoya, executive director of the DOST-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, clarified that the Philippines should not use any vaccine until it gets a final approval from the Food and Drug Administration.
According to Montoya, of all the vaccine candidates, those that have already been authorized for emergency use in other countries will likely be secured by second quarter of 2021.

The precautionary advice was given after the pair ""responded adversely"" following their shots on the first day of the mass vaccination rollout in the UK, NHS England said Wednesday.
According to PA Media, it is understood that both staff members had a significant history of allergic reactions and carried adrenaline autoinjectors. Thousands overall are believed to have been vaccinated in the UK on Tuesday.
""As is common with new vaccines the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday,"" said Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, in a statement.

It said that vaccines ""should only be carried out in facilities where resuscitation measures are available.""
Vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit told CNN that allergic reactions to vaccines were not uncommon: ""Certainly, vaccines can cause severe allergic reactions. In the United States, roughly one of every 1.4 million doses of vaccines is complicated by a severe allergic reaction.""
He said that rather than a ""blanket recommendation"" for people with allergies, ""the smarter thing to do would be to try and look at these two patients and see what specific component of the vaccine they were allergic to.""
He said people should realize that there are immediate treatments for allergic reaction. ""That's why you're hanging out in the doctor's office,"" he said, before warning that the reports of allergic reactions ""will only serve as yet another way to scare people.""
Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that the authorization and approval process for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine ""has been incredibly robust."" The head of Britain's medicines regulator also put out assurances on Sunday, saying the Pfizer/BioNTech shot was ""as safe as any general vaccine.""
US drug giant Pfizer and German company BioNTech have said there are ""no serious safety concerns"" over the vaccine.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention typically advises telling a provider if you have ""any severe, life-threatening allergies"" before taking any vaccine.

""I don't want to get ahead of the line, but I want to make sure we demonstrate to the American people that it is safe to take,"" Biden told reporters Wednesday in Wilmington, Delaware.
""When I do it, I'll do it publicly, so you can all witness my getting it done,"" the President-elect said.
People familiar with the plans say Biden is likely to get his shot next week. The delay has not been borne out of hesitation, aides say, but rather logistics of administering the shot in a public setting.
Biden told CNN's Jake Tapper earlier this month that he would be ""happy to"" receive a coronavirus vaccine once Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said it was safe, and that he would get the injection in a public setting to demonstrate his confidence in it. Vice President-elect Kamala Harris also said in the interview that she would get the vaccine.
Fauci said Tuesday on ABC's ""Good Morning America"" that he feels strongly that Biden and Harris should be vaccinated ""as soon as we possibly can.""
Three former presidents -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- have all said they would publicly get the coronavirus vaccine as a way to demonstrate its safety and efficacy.

Trump administration officials have discussed how and when President Donald Trump might receive a coronavirus vaccine, but haven't yet made a final decision on scheduling his shot, a person familiar with the plan previously told CNN.
The first doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech coronavirus vaccine were injected into health care workers, those at the front lines of the pandemic, on Monday. The vaccine was authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration for emergency use last week, and the first doses have been delivered to all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
Vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities be first in line to get vaccinated. It will likely be months before the vaccine is widely available to the rest of the population.
The FDA is also considering an Emergency Use Authorization for Moderna's vaccine candidate this week.
Biden has said his administration would aim to distribute 100 million vaccine shots, which is enough to cover 50 million people, in his initial 100 days in office. Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses administered several weeks apart in order to reach 95% efficacy.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/9/6/Russia-Sputnik-V-COVID-vaccine-frontliner-workers.html,Putin's vaccine meets opposition from frontline workers in Russia,Zahra Ullah and Anna Chernova,"Sep 6, 2020 4:52:17 PM","(CNN)— Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the approval of Russia's Sputnik-V coronavirus vaccine on August 11 amid much fanfare, saying it works ""quite effectively"" in forming a stable immunity.
How would he know this? Because the Russian President revealed one of his daughters had already taken it.
Speaking on Russian state TV at the time, Putin said his daughter had a slightly higher temperature after each dose of the two-stage coronavirus vaccine, but that ""Now she feels well.""
Russian authorities have singled out teachers -- as well as doctors -- as key workers who will get access to the vaccine first, even before crucial phase 3 human trials have finished.
But that's not gone down well with some sections of these frontline workers who don't buy Putin's claims of the efficacy of the vaccine and are reluctant to be used as human guinea pigs.
On September 1, Russian classrooms reopened for the first time since March amid the Covid-19 pandemic -- the same day the country surpassed 1 million coronavirus cases. Teachers were meant to be among the first to benefit from Russia's new coronavirus vaccine, especially given the close contact with hundreds of children that they are exposed to on a daily basis. But CNN is learning that few -- if any -- have so far taken up the offer to be vaccinated.
Developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, the Sputnik-V vaccine was named after the surprise 1957 launch of the world's first satellite by the Soviet Union.

Russia's claim of victory at being the first to approve a coronavirus vaccine in a worldwide pandemic was initially met with widespread concern and unanswered questions over its safety and effectiveness, and not just from outside the country.
A Russian teachers' union, ""Uchitel,"" started an online petition calling on members to reject the vaccine outright on safety grounds, and expressing concern that vaccination -- currently voluntary -- should not be made mandatory unless clinical trials are complete.
Reality can differ from promises
Yuri Varlamov, a teacher in Moscow and a member of the union, said he doesn't want to take the vaccine because he doesn't believe it is safe right now.
""Before the end of trials, they cannot make it mandatory. But I know that in some schools and state bodies, people are talking about mandatory status of this vaccine by the end of this year,"" Varlamov said.
Marina Balouyeva, co-chairman of the ""Uchitel"" union, said a petition against compulsory vaccination for teachers was more of a precaution.
Balouyeva said she is wary of Sputnik-V for several reasons. ""Firstly, it is generally known that the quality of domestic vaccines is worse than that of foreign ones,"" she said.
""Secondly, the vaccine was created at railway speed, which already raises concerns. It was created in haste.""
Despite promises from authorities that taking the vaccine will be voluntary, she said she fears things could go differently in reality, as often happens in Russian state institutions.
Balouyeva said no complaints have yet been made to her union from teachers saying they are being forced to be vaccinated. However, previous experience indicates there have been such problems with other vaccines, she says.
For example, officially, the seasonal flu shot is not mandatory for Russian educational workers -- it is voluntary. But according to Balouyeva some schools require it from their employees without fail.
Whether there will be sanctions on those unwilling to be vaccinated with Sputnik-V, depends on the headteacher. Most schools have a so-called ""incentive bonus"" -- a fund of money that the administration can distribute as they see fit. Some teachers could be deprived of this payment if they don't get the vaccine.
Balouyeva is all too familiar with the consequences that follow if you go against the school administration.
Having successfully worked for 15 years as an English teacher at a correctional school for children with cerebral palsy in St. Petersburg, Balouyeva says she was fired last year for an ""unexplained absence"" for not working during a school holiday.
It happened shortly after she was publicly vocal about teachers' salaries being lower than figures published in official documents.
""Teachers are a very disenfranchised category, just like doctors,"" the former teacher said, adding that the temptation to test the vaccine on them is immense. ""It is both cheap and practical -- why not do it, from the point of view of the authorities?""
CNN was given access by local authorities to one of Moscow's top public schools, where some measures -- like testing and teachers in facemasks -- have been implemented.
But no one CNN spoke to at School 1363 said they had taken the vaccine, although theysay they will ""definitely"" do so soon. Deputy head Maria Zatolokina said: ""I think that every teacher understands how important it is to be safe and to create a safe environment for our students to be healthy. That's why I hope that we are responsible people, and we should [all] be vaccinated.""
Political pressure
Critics such as Anastasia Vasilyeva, a Russian doctor turned prominent campaigner and ally of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, says the country's push for a vaccine comes amid political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray Russia as a global scientific force. Navalny is currently being treated in a Berlin hospital after a suspected poisoning attempt in Siberia last month.
""I think it's to show Russia is a big strong country, that Putin is a big strong president,"" Vasilyeva told CNN.
Her colleague, a surgeon at a hospital in northeast Moscow, shared his concerns about the vaccine with CNN, strictly on the condition of anonymity, due to fear of facing repercussions at work, if he came out publicly against the vaccine. When offered the vaccine in early August, he started consulting with experts.
""I am not a vaccine specialist,"" he admits, ""So, I called the doctors who deal with vaccinations, I called immunologists. They said, 'don't do it, by no means, the vaccine is raw.'""
It was a friendly offer, he says, no pressure, no obligations. But no matter how hard the deputy chief physician tried to persuade the surgeon that the vaccine is ""perfectly normal, good, amazing,"" the doctor still was reluctant to try it on himself.
""Explain to me: how could it be that such powerful European and international organizations could not do it, but a relatively small Gamaleya Institute could? I cannot understand it,"" the surgeon said.
He didn't know when the vaccine would be delivered to his hospital but said very few of his colleagues would have the courage to refuse it.
""Totalitarianism remains [in Russia]. The two most helpless sectors are education and health care. Everything is done forcefully here. Last year I had a flu shot, everyone was told they needed to be vaccinated. And everyone did it, because if you don't, there will be penalties.""
But it isn't just doctors and teachers who voiced concerns Russia may have cut essential corners in development.
Polls suggest around half of Russian citizens have doubts about the vaccine, the Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said on Friday during a video conference with Putin. He added, however, that two months ago, the figure was almost 90%.
Sobyanin, who revealed he had been vaccinated with Sputnik-V, was speaking just moments after Russia published its peer-reviewed data from phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials in The Lancet medical journal, which suggest the Russian vaccine has a good safety profile and produced no serious adverse side effects.
Scientists not involved in the study said while the results are a positive sign, only larger, Phase 3 trials can confirm whether the vaccine actually prevents illness with Covid-19.
The Russian defense minister was also shown getting the shot. It seems Russia's messaging about the vaccine has gone into full overdrive following the publication of its scientific data. It remains to be seen if the tide of public opinion and front-line workers will change over time too.

""To take an unapproved, unregulated vaccine is very, very dangerous,"" Dr. Edsel Salvana of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group said in a media forum on Sunday. ""I urge everyone to stay away from those, kasi (because) you are literally putting your life at risk if you take unregulated medicine, especially COVID vaccine.""
During Saturday's meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force and other health experts, President Rodrigo Duterte claimed that ""many"" citizens in the country have already been injected with China's Sinopharm vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration said raids have been conducted in Makati and Binondo, adding that no arrests have been made so far.
Salvana listed down the possible dangers of taking an unapproved vaccine, including lack of knowledge about the injected product, which he said would make it difficult for physicians to treat patients who may experience negative reactions.
""Say if you have a bad reaction. You don't even know kung ano 'yung binigay sayo eh (what was given to you)? So we wouldn't know what to treat you with,"" Salvana said. ""So there's really a lot of danger in doing those kinds of things. More than losing money, you could lose your life.""
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, meanwhile, refused to comment further on Duterte's statement.
""Hindi po ako makapagsalita nang kumpleto patungkol dito dahil iyon lang din pong narinig niyo ang narinig ko (I cannot fully talk about this because I only heard what you heard),"" Duque said in the same press conference.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/3/4/us-white-house-covid-vaccines.html,'They just were not all in': How the US White House convinced two pharmaceutical giants to collaborate on a vaccine,Jeremy Diamond,"Mar 4, 2021 11:30:47 AM","(CNN) — US President Joe Biden's coronavirus response team learned two things his first week in office: Johnson & Johnson's one-shot coronavirus vaccine was highly effective -- but the company was millions of doses behind its production schedule.
Preliminary conversations that began under the Trump administration about a vaccine manufacturing partnership between the pharmaceutical giant and its competitor, Merck, whose own vaccine attempt had failed, were ""incremental"" and going nowhere fast, according to two senior administration officials. And Johnson & Johnson seemed reluctant to commit to a large-scale deal with Merck, the officials said.
""They just were not all in,"" one of the officials told CNN.
That changed when Jeff Zients, the White House's coronavirus czar, called Johnson & Johnson's CEO Alex Gorsky on a Sunday in early February and urged the company to meet the moment, stressing that the US is in a ""national emergency"" and that it was time to go ""big and bold.""
""You can't be incremental and small in your thinking. We have to overwhelm this problem,"" one senior administration official said, recounting the conversation, which lasted an hour more than the scheduled 15 minutes.
Zients reminded Gorsky -- a West Point graduate and US military veteran -- of Johnson & Johnson's major contributions during World War II, including manufacturing the first-ever duct tape and other military supplies. Just as Americans remembered Johnson & Johnson's contributions then, its efforts to accelerate the vaccination of Americans would be their new legacy, Zients said, according to two senior officials.
""That was really a turning point,"" one of the officials said, noting that Gorsky ""embraced"" the approach and discussions about a large-scale partnership with Merck quickly turned more serious.

Hanging over that conversation and others between Biden administration officials and executives from both companies was Biden's authority under the Defense Production Act to compel the companies to partner if they were unwilling. A senior administration official said that authority was never explicitly threatened in conversations with both companies, but added that it was implicitly a motivating factor.
""The DPA is always there, implicitly as a tool, which brings people to the table and puts people on their toes,"" the official said.
The administration would have been willing to invoke the DPA's coercive authorities had the two companies not reached an agreement, but did not need to, the official said. Instead, Biden is exercising other authorities under the DPA to invest $105 million to help Merck retrofit its manufacturing facilities to produce the vaccine at scale and to expedite the supply of key vaccine production materials to Johnson & Johnson.
Biden announced the partnership on Tuesday, which he said will speed the production of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and ensure the US has ""enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,"" two months earlier than previously anticipated. He compared the partnership to ""the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War II.""
A Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined to comment for this story, referring CNN to comments Gorsky, the company's CEO, made Wednesday at a Washington Post event.
Gorsky said the company felt compelled to ""be doing everything we can to accelerate"" vaccine production and ""make a real difference with this virus.""
""In discussions with the government and trying to say, 'Hey what else could we be doing? How else could we accelerate?"" Gorsky said. ""And that's when in conversations that we were able to sit down together and bring this partnership to fruition.""
A Merck spokesman did not respond to CNN's requests for comment, but the company's executive vice president for manufacturing Sanat Chattopadhyay said in a statement Tuesday that the company looks ""forward to combining our expertise with Johnson & Johnson to help increase supply and expand access to"" the coronavirus vaccine.
Discussions about a manufacturing partnership between Johnson & Johnson and Merck began during the Trump administration, which had secured the initial purchase of 100 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. While Trump administration officials did not secure the partnership, those Trump-era discussions helped open the door to a deal between the two pharmaceutical competitors.
""It simply wasn't coming fast enough,"" Biden said Tuesday of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. ""So my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.""
A senior Biden administration official insisted that the conversations between the two companies with Trump administration officials were ""small ball,"" looking to make incremental increases in Johnson & Johnson's production rather than maximizing production capabilities and ensuring Johnson & Johnson facilities would be producing vaccines on a 24/7 schedule -- which will now be the case.
""There's a difference between conversations and it moving forward and the use of the Defense Production Act, which is something this president, and not the prior president, committed to invoking,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday, referring to the assistance to both companies to speed vaccine production.
Moncef Slaoui, the Trump administration's coronavirus vaccine czar, did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.
While administration officials described Zients' early February conversation with Gorsky as a ""turning point,"" it followed several other conversations between Zients and David Kessler, Biden's chief science officer charged with accelerating vaccine production and distribution, and executives at Johnson & Johnson and Merck.
While Biden did not call either company's CEOs directly, a senior official said the President was updated on the negotiations on a regular basis.
Those conversations were also facilitated by Zients' preexisting relationships with the CEOs of both companies, whom he knew from his time in the Obama administration working on health care and economic issues.
The two senior officials also credited Johnson & Johnson and Merck for ultimately getting on board with a partnership following key conversations in early February, with one official saying they ""have really been good corporate citizens in forming this partnership.""
""I think it's important that we acknowledge that both Merck and J&J are doing the right thing,"" the official said.

The IFRC described the disparity as alarming and said it could result in “deadly and devasting” consequences, warning that if large areas across the globe remain unvaccinated, the virus will carry on circulating and mutating.
“This is alarming because it is unfair, and because it could prolong or even worsen this terrible pandemic,” Jagan Chapagain, Secretary General of the IFRC, said.
“We are all rowing the same boat. We cannot sacrifice those at highest risk in some countries so that those at lowest risk can be vaccinated in others,” he added.

Pfizer also said it is in ""advance discussions"" with the Philippine government on a supply agreement for its COVID-19 vaccine, adding it plans to make doses available to the country as soon as possible. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., meanwhile, said there might already be a term sheet and supply agreement with the pharmaceutical firm within next week.
The official also said Pfizer vaccine doses may reach the Philippines as early as the first quarter of 2021 through the help of the COVAX facility, of which the country is part of. The facility purchases vaccines to be distributed for free to developing countries, covering a maximum of 20% of their respective populations.
Pfizer is the first to secure Emergency Use Authorization in the Philippines for a coronavirus vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration granted the approval Thursday, citing the vaccine's high efficacy rate.
Pfizer earlier bagged EUAs across the globe, including from the United States and the United Kingdom.

The first Briton to get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine — 90-year-old Margaret Keenan — received the first of two doses at 6:31 a.m. local time on Tuesday at University Hospital in Coventry, less than a week after the UK became the first country to approve it.
Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said she felt ""privileged"" to be first to get the shot. ""It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year,"" she said, according to a statement released by the UK's National Health Service (NHS).
The logistical challenges of manufacturing and distributing tens of millions of vaccines mean the roll out will be gradual, with the most vulnerable people and health care workers first in line.
May Parsons, the nurse who administered the historic jab, said she was honored to be involved in the program. ""The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said.
The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, but only 800,000 shots will be available as part of the first wave that began on Tuesday.
Because the vaccine requires two doses administered at least three weeks apart, the UK will have enough shots to vaccinate roughly a third of the country's population. The country has also ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which could be approved for emergency use in the UK within the next few weeks.
ADVERTISEMENT
There will be 50 vaccination hubs in hospitals across England and dozens more across Wales and Scotland. In England, the vaccinations will only be administered by hospitals. Wales and Scotland have yet to specify the types of locations they plan to have administer the vaccine.
Keenan will have to go back for the second dose in three or four weeks' time. According to the government's guidance, each vaccinated person will receive a credit card-sized vaccination document with details of their next appointment. Seven to 10 days after the second dose, she should be protected against the virus.
While the UK's immunization program started with a big bang on Tuesday, the vaccine remains off limits to the vast majority of people.
For now, it is available by invitation only for those age 80 and over, care homes staff and frontline health and social care workers. Care home residents were also expected to be prioritized, but the government said last week this won't happen immediately.
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at minus 75 degrees Celsius (minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit), which makes its distribution difficult. Moderna's vaccine, if approved, could be a more practical option for the care homes, as it can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit).
The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offers 95% protection against Covid-19. According to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), more than one in 10 recipients may suffer side effects including pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. A handful of other, less common, side effects are also listed.
The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to follow the UK's MHRA and authorize the emergency use for the Pfizer vaccine as soon as this week — its vaccine advisory committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday.
The European Medicines Agency will conclude its decision on the vaccine on December 29, according to the European Commission.

PHE's Siren Study, which was carried out on healthcare workers aged under the age of 65, found that one dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 72% after three weeks, while two vaccine doses reduced the risk of infection by 85%. This high level of protection extended to the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant first identified in the UK in December.
Health workers were tested for COVID-19 infection every two weeks using PCR tests and twice a week with lateral flow tests, Dr. Susan Hopkins, strategic response director at PHE, explained, meaning ""there was a lot of asymptomatic testing,"" she said.
""Overall we are seeing a really strong effect to reducing any infection: asymptomatic and symptomatic,"" Hopkins said during a press conference held by the UK's Science Media Centre on Monday.
PHE also analyzed routine testing data based on symptomatic disease in over 12,000 people, which showed that one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 57% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 disease in those aged over 80 four weeks after the first dose. This increased to 88% one week after the second dose.
Early data has also shown that vaccinated people who are subsequently infected are far less likely to die of, or be hospitalized with, the virus. People over the age of 80 who were infected post vaccination were 41% less likely to be hospitalized with the virus and 57% less likely to die of it.
PHE predicted that protection against severe disease was likely to be over 75% in those who have received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
""The good sign is overall we are beginning to see a decline in hospitalizations and deaths in those vaccinated age groups [and] at least some is attributable to the vaccination program,"" Dr. Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at PHE, said during the press conference.
She said that while the UK's current lockdown had played a part in the decline in hospitalizations, ""the faster speed in decline can be attributed in some aspects to the vaccination program.""
In the PHE release, Ramsay cautioned that despite the encouraging signs ""we don't yet know how much these vaccines will reduce the risk of you passing COVID-19 on to others,"" adding that vaccinated people should continue to follow stay-at-home orders.
The UK has placed its focus on vaccinating as many high-risk people as possible with the first dose.
UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was ""extremely encouraging"" that data supported the UK government's ""decision to maximize the number of people vaccinated with a single dose.""

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/2/5/covid-vaccines-cancer-patients.html,Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for cancer patients? Here is what cancer experts say,Lauren Kent,"Feb 5, 2021 11:30:18 PM","(CNN) -- Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for cancer patients?
It's a question that has been on the minds of researchers and oncologists long before the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine rollouts began. Although there is a consensus that the vaccines are safe for most cancer patients, according to the American Cancer Society and others in the medical community, research into whether they will be effective for cancer patients is still a data-free zone.
The American Cancer Society recommends that cancer patients talk to their doctors before getting any type of vaccine because all patients and their courses of treatment are different.
There are several factors that may require a cancer patient to delay vaccination, including recent stem cell transplants or other recent use of therapy agents known to reduce vaccine efficacy, according to Dr. Laura Makaroff, the American Cancer Society's Senior Vice President for Prevention and Early Detection.
ADVERTISEMENT
""As far as safety of the vaccine, every situation for every patient with cancer is a little different. And there's a spectrum of where any one patient might be in their cancer journey,"" Makaroff told CNN. ""The COVID-19 vaccine is definitely safe for people with cancer but it's important that patients have a conversation with their healthcare provider and their cancer care team to determine when is the right time to have the vaccine.""
""All the guidance that we're seeing -- the American Cancer society and other leading oncology groups -- is that COVID-19 immunization is recommended for patients in active therapy, but we really understand that there are limited safety and efficacy data on these patients,"" Makaroff said.
Even with limited data, many cancer experts, medical groups, and doctors are making a big push for vaccinating most cancer patients -- especially those cancer patients most at risk during the pandemic.
""The potential benefits far outweigh the risks,"" said Dr. Brian Koffman, chief medical officer for the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Society, a group that represents patients with the most common adult form of leukemia in the western world.
""Despite the lack of safety data specifically in patients with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), SARS-Cov-2 vaccination is anticipated to be safe.""
Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who develop symptomatic COVID-19 have an 89% risk of hospitalization, Koffman told CNN, based on a study published in the journal Nature.
CLL is characterized by a weakened immune system. The immunocompromization is so severe that CLL patients are advised to avoid live vaccines such as the ones for measles or yellow fever.
And a weakened immune system also means these cancer patients have an increased risk of death due to Covid-19, according to Dr. Chaitra Ujjani, a physician at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and oncology professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The Nature study, conducted the by European Research Initiative on CLL, found that the mortality rate for CLL patients with symptomatic coronavirus was 31%.
""The thing that people don't quite realize is that the impaired immune system in CLL patients -- due to the disease or some of the treatments for the disease -- can actually impact your response to vaccination,"" Ujjani told CNN.
""We recommend the COVID-19 vaccines for our patients ... but we're not really sure how effective it's going to be,"" she added. ""Patients with blood cancers are typically excluded from the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of the vaccine.""
Cancer-specific vaccine trials underway
To remedy the lack of data, Ujjani is launching a research study involving 500 CLL patients across the country -- all of whom are already slated to receive the vaccine from their doctor or pharmacist -- to determine what kind of immune response they will have to the commercially available vaccines.
The study, which is a collaboration between more than 10 medical institutions, will be the first of its kind and may bring more clarity for cancer patients.
The Seattle Cancer Care Alliance is conducting similar trials for other cancer types, including certain immune system and blood cancers, Ujjani said.
Advocacy groups for other more prevalent types of cancer are also encouraging cancer patients to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The Lung Cancer Action Network recently asked the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to give lung cancer patients expedited access to the vaccines.
""Because COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory condition, this disease presents a unique challenge to lung cancer patients, who are at extremely high risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19,"" said the group in a letter.
More research urgently needed
The scientific community agrees that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients -- and many doctors are working around the clock to get more trials off the ground.
""We need these data so that we can better inform patients and better prioritize the allocation of the vaccines. If these vulnerable patients form an adequate immune response, we should certainly vaccinate them as early as possible,"" Dr. Elad Sharon, senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute, told CNN via email.
""But, if research efforts show that these patients fail to form a protective response to these vaccines, then what we will need to do will be to vaccinate everyone around these patients first, so that our medically vulnerable patients are most protected by the people living with them and caring for them.""
Ujjani added, ""We're all working really hard to answer this question, but it's hard because we've been working kind of against the clock as the vaccines just became available.""
""A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,"" Ujjani told CNN. ""So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine.""

This, as Vice President Leni Robredo earlier said the move could boost Filipinos' confidence in vaccines.
""'Yan po ay sinasangguni naman na... Hayaan po natin siyang magdesisyon,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque told a briefing when asked for the Palace's reaction to Robredo's statement.
[Translation: The matter is being discussed already... Let's let him decide.]
On Saturday, Robredo said vaccinating Duterte first will help strengthen public trust in the government's vaccination program against the coronavirus. Of 2,400 Filipino adults surveyed by Pulse Asia last November 23 to December 2, 47% said they were not willing to get vaccinated due to safety concerns.
Roque stressed the national government did not really expect to earn the confidence of Filipinos when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines, saying many are on a wait-and-see mode before they opt to get vaccinated.
But he said the government is ""in no rush"" since only 50,000 to 100,000 doses are expected to arrive in the Philippines next month.
In August last year, Duterte himself offered to be the first person to receive a COVID-19 vaccine from Russia to prove its effectiveness.
When asked what vaccine is recommended for the President, infectious diseases expert Rontgene Solante, who was also present during the briefing, said all three vaccines—Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca—are ""safe to be given regardless of age.""
Roque stressed Duterte's own vaccination plan is ""solely between him and his doctor.""
The top priority sectors of the vaccination program include the 'poorest of the poor', and the police and military, Duterte previously said.
The government received a public uproar following the unauthorized vaccination of the Presidential Security Group.

“The integration of sites in Europe, and now especially in Germany, is aimed at supporting an approval in Europe,"" said Ugur Sahin, CEO and cofounder of BioNTech, in a news release on Monday.
The BNT162b2 mRNA-based vaccine candidate is already in similar large-scale trials in the United States. The trial involves giving the participants two doses of a 30 microgram vaccine – one on the first day and one 28 days later – with participants being followed up for up to two years after they receive the second dose.
In August, the companies presented ""promising"" results in early data on safety and immune responses in their ongoing Phase 1/2 study in the United States. Among both younger and older adults in the trial, the companies said the vaccine ""was well tolerated with mild to moderate fever in fewer than 20% of the participants."" The companies also noted in their news release that seven days after participants were given a second dose of the vaccine at 30 micrograms, the vaccine was able to elicit neutralizing antibodies in younger adults ages 18 to 55, and in older adults ages 65 to 85.

The data has not yet published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.
The companies plan to seek regulatory authorization or approval for the drug as early as October if it is successful in clinical trial testing. They plan to supply up to 100 million doses worldwide by the end of 2020 and 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021.
Many infectious disease experts say, however, that it’s highly unlikely Pfizer will have enough data to allow for an emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration in October.

""We will start to have shots in arms within 96 hours of EUA,"" Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday. ""That's what I believe with all my heart.""
Pfizer and Moderna both have vaccine candidates awaiting EUAs, and the US Food and Drug Administration has confirmed Pfizer's safety and efficacy ahead of a Thursday approval meeting. The anticipated approval comes as the US suffers spikes in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths.
The US has averaged 206,152 new cases a day over the last seven days -- the highest number of cases in the pandemic so far. And Tuesday, 104,600 people were hospitalized with the virus, according to The COVID Tracking Project, a record that has been set and broken over and over in recent weeks. In total, 286,232 people have died of the virus and more than 15.1 million people have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The wider public will likely have to continue to grapple with spikes from the holiday season until vaccines are widely available in 2021. But officials are racing to distribute vaccines in the coming days for priority populations -- the elderly and health care workers.
While it will be a ""herculean task,"" Perna said that he is confident that, with the planning from the CDC and collaboration from partners, ""we will be able to execute this vaccine very efficiently, but more importantly, effectively.""
States prepare for vaccine distribution amid 'tragic milestones'
The impacts of the pandemic are spread across the country, Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services Admiral Brett Giroir told CNN Tuesday.

Los Angeles County confirmed a total of 8,000 coronavirus deaths and over 3,000 hospitalizations on Tuesday, which the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health called a ""tragic milestone"" in a news release. And Pennsylvania recorded its highest number of coronavirus hospitalizations Tuesday.
As local leaders manage rising cases, many are also getting their vaccine plans in order.
In Illinois, though the first delivery is expected next week, it will take months to roll out a vaccine, even to priority groups, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) said during a news conference Tuesday.
Delaware also anticipates receiving its first shipment next week. Dr. Karyl Rattay, with Delaware's Division of Public Health, announced Tuesday that the state is expecting nearly 9,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine around December 15 and more than 8,000 of Moderna's the following week.
Once Minnesota gets its first shipment of vaccines expected next week, they will be sent directly to key hospitals or ""hubs"" and then be delivered to smaller clinics, Gov. Tim Walz said during a news briefing.
Minnesota, Illinois, Mississippi and Delaware have said health care workers and long-term care residents will be the first to receive vaccinations.
'Vaccines that are not used are useless'
But for vaccines to be effective, the public has to use them -- and officials are urging participation in inoculations.
""Vaccines that are not used are useless,"" Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday. ""Vaccination is what's important.""
Their development has been fast, but experts say that doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective or unsafe.
Slaoui said that the speed came from taking operational and financial risks to develop the vaccine, not cutting scientific corners.
""The first thing is to point out that the speed has nothing to do with compromising safety or scientific integrity,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci said. ""It's due to the extraordinary and exquisite advances in vaccine platform technology which has allowed us to do things in weeks to months that formerly took years, several years.
There is concern that many Americans will be skeptical about getting vaccines, but Fauci acknowledged a ""painful disparity"" in the prevalence of the virus among African Americans as well as a ""reluctance and skepticism about getting vaccinated.""
""I will tell you that I myself will be perfectly comfortable in taking the vaccine and I would recommend it to my family,"" he said.
US needs to pull together for holiday season
As more holidays approach, it is increasingly imperative that Americans acknowledge the realities of the pandemic and pull together to mitigate its impacts, experts said.
""The end of the pandemic is in sight. The vaccine will work, it will end the pandemic and return us to as near normal or normal as possible, but we have to do our part right now, which is those mitigations techniques,"" Giroir said.
The US was recording 40,000 to 70,000 new coronavirus cases daily before Thanksgiving, and the addition of holiday spread has resulted in a surge on top of a surge, Fauci said.
And families and friends gathering for Christmas and Hanukkah could add another spike to the mix, making impacts of the pandemic even worse in December and January, he said.
""We're going to be asking people to do something that is difficult and maybe even painful, particularly at the family level, is to tell people, unless it's absolutely necessary, not to travel,"" he said. ""We said that over Thanksgiving and we're saying the same thing over Christmas.""

""Kung sino ang country na nakapag-imbento, malamang unahin niya ang mga tao niya (Whichever country invents the vaccine will most likely prioritize its own people). That's the reality,"" Duterte said in his address to the nation on Tuesday.
The President said he intends to keep his promise to have all Filipinos vaccinated, with the poor getting priority. However, he expects this would not be viable ""within the (first) few months (of the vaccine's availability) until next year.""

[Translation: It's not that we don't want to buy. There's nothing yet for us to buy because as I've said, the vaccine produced in America has been immediately bought. I think the federal government has made the first installment.]
Duterte also pointed out that the countries with COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers generally have huge populations to take care of. ""So tatapusin muna 'yan nila bago 'yan sila magbigay sa iba (So they will first complete the vaccination among their populations before they would offer a supply to other countries),"" he said.
American pharmaceutical company Pfizer recently reported that its coronavirus vaccine, which it made with its German partner BioNTech, is more than 90% effective based on its early analysis.

The shipment, consisting of 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccines, arrived at 7 am GMT Wednesday on an Emirates flight at Kotoka International Airport, in Ghana's capital Accra.
The minister for health-designate, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu, led a government delegation to receive the consignment.
As the plane carrying the vaccines landed, state-run Ghana Broadcasting Corporation journalist Abdul Hayi-Moomen declared: ""The flight carrying the vaccines that we so much look forward to receiving, I believe hope has arrived.""
ADVERTISEMENT
The vaccines were produced by the Serum Institute of India, in the Indian city of Pune, and are part of the first wave of COVID-19 vaccines headed to low and middle-income countries, the joint statement added.
""Today marks the historic moment for which we have been planning and working so hard,"" said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. ""With the first shipment of doses, we can make good on the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the race for life-saving vaccines.""
COVAX is an international coalition set up to give equal access to the vaccine to all countries. Wealthier nations have, in the past, been accused of ""hoarding"" vaccines and leaving African countries behind in the race to inoculate their populations.
In comparison to other regions, African countries have been slow to start vaccinating against Covid, with only a handful of countries who have started a vaccines campaign.
""We will not end the pandemic anywhere unless we end it everywhere,"" said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus after Ghana received its vaccines.
""Today is a major first step towards realizing our shared vision of vaccine equity, but it's just the beginning,"" he added.
""We still have a lot of work to do with governments and manufacturers to ensure that vaccination of health workers and older people is underway in all countries within the first 100 days of this year,"" he said in a statement issued by GAVI, the global health alliance working to increase immunization in developing nations.
The UK's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, described Wednesday's rollout as a ""huge step forward in ending this pandemic.""
""As one of the biggest donors to COVAX the UK is ensuring that more than one billion vaccine doses will be sent to 92 countries so that no one is left behind in this global fight. We will only save lives and reduce the risk of future infections if we prevent the virus spreading in the world's developing countries,"" he added.
Ghana's information ministry says the vaccines will be first administered to health workers, people over 60, and those with underlying health conditions. They also plan to secure additional vaccines through external agencies, a statement from the ministry said.
Last month, India and the African Union announced plans for the Serum Institute to supply 400 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Africa.
Ghana has reported at least 80,759 cases of COVID-19 and 582 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Sometimes it comes back without her trying to remember.
What happened March 4 before the dawn and into the night haunts her.
The sirens seemed to blare endlessly outside the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington.
""That was the night (we had) like five ambulances in the parking lot,"" she said.
It was the night she sent patients to the hospital whom she expected would be treated and eventually released. They never came back.
It was the date she figured out ""the whole cascade of symptoms"" of a virus the nursing home learned had invaded just four days earlier.
It was also the day she had to make some gut-wrenching phone calls.
ADVERTISEMENT
One at 3 a.m. she can't shake from her mind. She remembers the conversation with the woman on the other end of the line.
""I realized this was early in the morning, and this is very difficult to say that I am really sorry that your mom has passed away,"" Earnest said. ""I cried with her.""
The two, who had never met, shared a heartbreaking moment. Ten months later, they still sometimes talk, Earnest said.
Earnest, a registered nurse, volunteered to help out the Kirkland nursing home from her position as a nursing director at another Life Care Center in the state.
They needed all the help they could get. Nearly 70% of the staff had tested positive for coronavirus in March.
She had no idea that the inconspicuous building on a tree-lined street in a quiet residential neighborhood in Kirkland would become America's first epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.
Eventually the state department of health reported 46 people linked to the nursing home died of coronavirus; 39 of them were patients. Ten patients died at the nursing home itself, Earnest said.
""It was like chasing a ghost,"" she told CNN in March. ""You're in a battlefield where supplies are limited. The help's slow to get to you and there's lots of casualties. And you can't see the enemy.""
Ten months since the initial outbreak, she and other frontline health care workers here are finally getting the best weapon available to battle the virus: the vaccine.
Alice Cortez, a nursing manager at Life Care Center of Kirkland, was the first to get the vaccine here.
""This is an exciting day for everybody especially my team,"" she said as her voice cracked with emotion.
""What I feel right now is a new life, a new beginning, but a better life.""
One by one, nurses, a doctor and other frontline workers at the facility came outside to get their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That vaccine was the first to get emergency approval by the FDA.
Coronavirus remains a threat at nursing homes
But everyone here is well aware that the virus is still raging and remains a threat to the most vulnerable people: The people they are charged with caring for.
For now, the Kirkland nursing home has no positive coronavirus cases. But of the 26 Life Care Center nursing homes in the region, eight facilities have Covid-19 cases right now. At one point this year, 24 of the 26 did.
As of December 13, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees nursing homes, says 441,000 nursing home patients have tested positive for coronavirus across the United States and 86,775 nursing home residents have died from Covid-19. And 1,258 staff members have perished, too.
""There is not a day that goes by where I don't get a phone call or a message that we have a new positive patient or staff,"" said Nancy Butner, vice president of Life Care Centers of America Northwest division. Butner said some of her staff have been hospitalized recently. And more patients have died in other facilities.
""It is relentless,"" Butner said.
Initially, some families and the public blamed the nurses, doctors and staff at Life Care Center of Kirkland for the outbreak and not controlling it better.
The phones never stopped ringing. Families couldn't get through -- sometimes doctors couldn't -- because of other unwanted calls.
""It was very hard to go into a patient's room and hear the phone. And you think it's a doctor, and you get there and it's some person saying they have the cure for Covid giving you a recipe that is as crazier than they are,"" Earnst said.
Too often, it was the most jarring kind of call: death threats, enough to require security. Earnest was afraid to go to her car one night after treating patients.
""My husband said, 'Make sure you have your gun,'"" she said, able to laugh about it now. But he was serious and so were the threats.
Then there was the sight of the devastated families who showed up every day.
Some had lost their mom or dad at the facility, and others had family still inside infected with Covid-19. They sat in chairs outside their family member's room window, eating lunch with them and having muffled conversations through the glass.
Inside, the staff was dealing with a virus no one knew enough about.
It was before the public was told to wear masks, before the elbow bump became the new handshake, before all of the symptoms were known. And it was before tens of thousands of people began getting sick and dying in New York City, which soon became the second epicenter of the virus.
In April, state and federal agencies that oversee nursing homes also blamed Life Care Center of Kirkland. The federal report said: ""inspectors found three 'Immediate Jeopardy' situations, which are situations in which a patient's safety is placed in imminent danger.""
Life Care Center appealed the ruling. In September, a state administrative judge largely sided with the Life Care Center of Kirkland, not the state findings, which mimicked the federal ones.
The judge said the state agency ""provided relatively little evidence that the facility actually failed to meet any expected standard of care or failed to follow public health guidelines.""
The federal appeal has not been decided.
Changes made since the March outbreak
In the beginning, there were not enough coronavirus tests, and it took days to get results. Now, they have rapid tests that take minutes.
In some rooms, there were three patients. Now, that's down to one -- or two if they can be properly distanced.
Before the virus, the facility accepted as many as 124 patients. Now they've capped it at 97.
Back then, there was a constant worry about a lack of personal protective equipment. Now, a nearby facility has a large room stuffed with boxes of masks, gloves and other gear.
But 10 months after the initial viral outbreak, the chairs for family members remain outside the windows of the rooms. Room numbers are scrawled on the windows.
That has become a semi-permanent fixture because visitors still aren't allowed inside.
There is no family hand-holding or hugs and kisses. It is simply too dangerous, the virus too contagious. The staff knows that now.
In the beginning, Earnest, a registered nurse, was informing doctors and members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of what she was seeing in patients. Now, they get constant updates and new safety protocols from government agencies.
Covid-19 impacts staff inside and outside the nursing home
Butner says what people don't often think about is that the staff has to battle the virus at work and at home.
Earnest lost an uncle to Covid-19 this year. So before Christmas she had to have ""the talk"" with her mother about how she wanted to die.
""If she got it, what did she want? Did she want to be on a ventilator or did she want to be ... let go?""
It was the hardest conversation she's had with family. But she says she couldn't avoid it. No one should.
It is too awful when they are taken away and isolated and you don't get to know their wishes. Sometimes you don't get to say goodbye, she said.
Earnest said she hopes the vaccine will make these conversations less urgent. But not everybody at the nursing facilities is looking forward to getting it.
""We did a survey with the staff at our facilities before we did education on the vaccine. Twenty percent said no, never. They would not get vaccinated,"" she said.
For now, she says, Life Care Centers of America isn't making it mandatory. The reason is simple.
""We simply could not lose 20% of our staff,"" she said. ""Another effect of this virus is an extreme shortage of nursing staff for all of health care.""
She is hoping that with education, the percentage will shrink.
For physician's assistant Christy Carmichael, her decision to get the vaccine made everyone gasp. Last week she had promised one of her patients who had survived Covid-19 that she would be able get the vaccine.
""I said sure you can. Unfortunately she passed away,"" Carmichael said, before dissolving into tears after getting her vaccine shot. ""I did promise her that she would get it, so it's just sad that she didn't get to see this today.""

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/8/12/russia-covid-vaccine-sputnik-v.html,What we know — and don't know —about Russia's 'Sputnik V' vaccine,Zamira Rahim,"Aug 12, 2020 7:27:12 PM","(CNN) — Russia raised eyebrows on Tuesday when it announced the world's first approved coronavirus vaccine for public use.
President Vladimir Putin says his own daughter has already received it, but testing is yet to be completed and experts are skeptical about how quickly the vaccine has been registered.
While details about the research behind the vaccine are limited, here's what we know so far.
What do we know about the Russian vaccine?
The vaccine was developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, using funding from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). The vaccine is named Sputnik V -- a reference to the 1957 Soviet Union satellite.
Scientists conducted months of human trials but are yet to publish data and did not begin the crucial Phase 3 stage, which usually precedes approval, before the announcement on Tuesday.
On Wednesday it was announced that a Phase 3 trial involving more than 2,000 people in Russia and several Middle Eastern and Latin American countries had begun. Typically this stage of trial involves testing on tens of thousands of people.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said Tuesday that the number of people the vaccine had been tested on so far was the equivalent of a Phase 1 trial, which typically involves a small group and studies the safety of the vaccine.
ADVERTISEMENT
Is the Russian vaccine safe?
The short answer is that we don't know. Russia has released no scientific data on its vaccine testing and CNN is unable to verify claims about its safety or effectiveness. But Russia says the vaccine has passed through Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials which were completed on August 1.
A Phase 1 study typically focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and whether it elicits an immune response in a small number of people.
""We do not have any information whatsoever on whether this is safe,"" Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University of Nottingham, told CNN.
Russia claims that volunteers in the Phase 1 and 2 trials felt well after taking the vaccine, and exhibited no unforeseen or unwanted side effects.
Neal said that researchers were unlikely to have detected any rare side effects linked to the Gamaleya vaccine.
""You won't know about side effects without [widespread] testing, if they're rare. That's the point of a Phase 3 study,"" he said.
""I wouldn't take it, certainly not outside of a clinical trial right now,"" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.
Is the vaccine effective?
Without data and completed Phase 3 trials, Russia has not proven to the world Sputnik V works.
""I would think that it at least produces antibodies. What we don't know is if it protects people against infection,"" Neal told CNN.
Russia has said that its vaccine is an adenoviral vector one. Adenoviruses cause the common cold, but in Covid-19 vaccines they're weakened and modified to deliver genetic material that codes for a protein from the novel coronavirus.
The body then produces that protein and may produce an immune response against it but the method can cause problems.
Sputnik V's makers say the vaccine induced a ""strong antibody and cellular immune response,"" in trial volunteers, according to the official website for the vaccine.
""Not a single participant of the current clinical trials got infected with Covid-19 after being administered with the vaccine,"" the statement adds.
""It's not clear how efficacious the Russian vaccine is going to be and whether or not people have some prior immunity to the adenovirus that they're using to deliver the coronavirus gene sequence,"" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expressed similar concerns.
""I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that,"" Fauci told Deborah Roberts of ABC News for a National Geographic event to broadcast Thursday. A portion of the interview was posted by National Geographic on Tuesday.
How did Russia pull this off so quickly?
In April, Russia enacted a law which eliminated the need for a Phase 3 vaccine trial before approval.
Approval now means the coronavirus vaccine can be distributed even as Phase 3 tests get underway -- though practically speaking, mass-manufactured doses aren't expected to be ready for weeks.
""They're not as far ahead as other vaccines,"" Neal said, noting that Moderna and Oxford's vaccines have already begun Phase 3 trials.
Critics say Russia's haste is partly due to political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray the country as a global scientific force.
Russia is not alone when it comes to fast tracking -- China approved an experimental coronavirus vaccine in June for members of its military.
And while its vaccine data from Phase 1 and 2 trials are yet to be published, US, UK and Canadian security officials warned in July that Russian cyber actors were targeting organizations involved in coronavirus vaccine development.
Who will get it first?
Russia's Health Ministry has said the country's frontline medical staff and teachers will be the first vaccinated.
The country plans to begin mass vaccination of citizens in October, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the RDIF told CNN on Tuesday.
""We will start massive vaccination of Russians in October. This vaccine will be available to other countries around November,"" Dmitriev told CNN's Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta.
At the end of July officials denied reports that members of the country's political and business elite -- including Putin -- had been given early access to the vaccine.
Russia plans to mass produce the vaccine by September 2020.
Which countries will take the vaccine? And which won't?
A lot of countries appear keen to try Sputnik V. Dmitriev said at a Tuesday press conference that Russia had ""received preliminary applications for over 1 billion doses of the vaccine from 20 countries.""
""Countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia have displayed the greatest interest in the vaccine, and we are about to finalize a number of contracts for the purchase of the vaccine,"" he added.
Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has publicly expressed his enthusiasm for the vaccine and claimed that he is willing to volunteer in further trials.
""I will volunteer to receive it in public. I will be the first to be experimented on,"" Duterte said during his address to the Philippines late Monday broadcast by state-run RTVM.
As it stands, the Russian vaccine is unlikely to be meet approval regulations for European Union countries and in the US, will need the FDA's approval.
""The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) have fast-track approval procedures for emergency humanitarian use and we need to see evidence that Russia is adopting an equally prudent approach,"" said Duncan Matthews, Professor of IP Law at Queen Mary University of London, in a statement to the Science Media Center.
""The point is not to be first with a vaccine. The point is to have a vaccine that is safe and effective for the American people and the people of the world,"" US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said on ABC Tuesday.

The inoculation, which had yet to progress beyond Phase 1 trials, was being jointly developed by the University of Queensland and Australian biotech company CSL. Australia had hoped the vaccine would be available by mid-2021.
In a statement, CSL said that no serious adverse effects had been reported in the 216 trial participants, and the vaccine was shown to have a ""strong safety profile."" However trial data revealed that antibodies generated by the vaccine interfered with HIV diagnosis and led to false positives on some HIV tests, CSL said.
If the vaccine was rolled out nationally, CSL said it could undermine public health in Australia by causing a wave of false positive HIV tests in the community.
""Follow up tests confirmed that there is no HIV virus present, just a false positive on certain HIV tests. There is no possibility the vaccine causes infection,"" the statement added.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday morning that the vaccine ""will no longer feature as part of the country's vaccine plan."" Australia had pre-emptively ordered 51 million doses of the CSL vaccine in October.
Morrison said that Australia had backed four vaccines that showed promise but ""at no stage ... believed that all four of those vaccines would likely get through that process.""
ADVERTISEMENT
""So that's why we spread our risk. That's why we backed important projects. And that's why we pre-prepared to ensure that we could deal with any issues along the way,"" he said.
In addition to the University of Queensland vaccine, Australia had previously ordered a combined 73.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca and the Novavax vaccines.
Australian Minister for Health Greg Hunt said that following the announcement, Australia would be ordering an extra 20 million units from AstraZeneca and 11 million from Novovax.
A vaccine has to pass through three stages of trials before it can then be considered for approval for public use. Australia has yet to grant approval to a coronavirus vaccine candidate.
Adam Taylor, early career research leader in emerging viruses at Griffith University's Menzies Health Institute, said in an emailed statement that the false positive HIV results were a result of the technology used to create the vaccine.
""The (vaccine's) molecular clamp is made from a HIV protein, which on its own is harmless. The molecular clamp stabilizes the coronavirus spike protein and presents it to the body in a way that promotes a good immune response. This is why the clamp technology is so vital,"" Taylor said.
He added that the clamp model vaccine had shown ""good safety and immune response"" against the coronavirus in early clinical trials, and the possibility for generating an HIV positive result had been thought to be low.
Some Australian health experts have praised the University of Queensland researchers for ending the trial when they did. ""Although it might seem counter-intuitive, from a research ethics viewpoint, this is a success,"" said Diego Silva, an health ethics expert at the University of Sydney School of Public Health, in an emailed statement.",CNN,2020-12-11 11:48:33,"The inoculation, which had yet to progress beyond Phase 1 trials, was being jointly developed by the University of Queensland and Australian biotech company CSL.If the vaccine was rolled out nationally, CSL said it could undermine public health in Australia by causing a wave of false positive HIV tests in the community.And that's why we pre-prepared to ensure that we could deal with any issues along the way,"" he said.In addition to the University of Queensland vaccine, Australia had previously ordered a combined 73.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca and the Novavax vaccines.Adam Taylor, early career research leader in emerging viruses at Griffith University's Menzies Health Institute, said in an emailed statement that the false positive HIV results were a result of the technology used to create the vaccine.This is why the clamp technology is so vital,"" Taylor said.He added that the clamp model vaccine had shown ""good safety and immune response"" against the coronavirus in early clinical trials, and the possibility for generating an HIV positive result had been thought to be low.",5.0,0.9240999817848206,"city, worker, health, doh, get, trial, first, astrazeneca, sinovac, rollout","['australian', 'trial', 'end', 'test', 'subject', 'return', 'false', 'positive', 'hiv', 'result']",0.5574,0.0,0.714,0.286,0.3696969696969697,Positive
http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/12/22/Covid-vaccine-fetuses.html,Vatican OKs getting Covid-19 vaccines that used cell lines from aborted fetuses,John Allen,"Dec 22, 2020 8:02:19 AM","(CNN) — Being vaccinated against Covid-19 is morally acceptable, the Vatican deemed, after some anti-abortion groups raised concerns about how the vaccines were manufactured.
Some groups had suggested the coronavirus vaccines were made using cells from aborted fetuses. The cells are actually engineered and grown in labs from tissue acquired many decades ago, and are not made directly from aborted fetuses.
The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said in a note approved by Pope Francis on Monday that receiving the shot was morally permitted.
""It is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process,"" the note said.
ADVERTISEMENT
The statement was issued and signed by the head of the Congregation in response to several requests for guidelines regarding the use of the vaccine.
There have been some disagreements within the clergy regarding the ethics of taking a Covid-19 vaccine because it had used tissue retrieved from two abortions that took place in the last century.
The abortion connection, which had prompted a number of Bishops to voice their opposition to the vaccine, has now been rejected by the Vatican and by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops had already issued a statement earlier in the month stating that the use of Covid-19 vaccines is morally justified.
""Given the urgency of this crisis, the lack of available alternative vaccines, and the fact that the connection between an abortion that occurred decades ago and receiving a vaccine produced today is remote, inoculation with the new COVID-19 vaccines in these circumstances can be morally justified"".
The statement adds that receiving the vaccines do not indicate a cooperation with abortion, and that is not to be considered as an endorsement in any way.
""The licit use of such vaccines does not and should not in any way imply that there is a moral endorsement of the use of cell lines proceeding from aborted foetuses"".
The Vatican's statement is aimed at addressing the moral questions surrounding the vaccine and does not aim to judge the safety or effectiveness.
The statement also called on the governments, pharmaceutical companies, and international organisations to pay extra attention to the equitable distribution of the vaccine to the poorer countries.
""There is also a moral imperative for the pharmaceutical industry, governments and international organizations to ensure that vaccines, which are effective and safe from a medical point of view, as well as ethically acceptable, are also accessible to the poorest countries in a manner that is not costly for them,"" it said.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/11/27/AstraZeneca-COVID-vaccine-trial-findings-transparency-data.html,AstraZeneca hopes the world can focus on its positive vaccine news. But experts fear a lack of transparency has clouded that,Kara Fox,"Nov 27, 2020 2:25:32 AM","(CNN) — When the British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca announced on Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine is 70% effective on average, the world exhaled a collective sigh of relief and stocks rallied. Another vaccine with promising results had arrived.
But a lack of clarity surrounding several aspects of the data from the AstraZeneca vaccine trials have raised some eyebrows in the scientific community, potentially setting back the timing for the vaccine to be authorized in Europe and the US.
AstraZeneca said on Monday that study participants in the UK had been given two different courses of the vaccine.
The drugmaker, which developed the vaccine with the University of Oxford, did not however, at the time, explain why they used two different dosing regimens or why the size of one group was significantly smaller than the other.
In one group, 2,741 participants received a half-dose of the vaccine and then a full dose at least a month later. This group was 90% protected against COVID-19.
In the second group, 8,895 participants received a full dose followed by another full dose at least a month later. This group was only 62% protected.
That's why AstraZeneca says their vaccine is 70% effective, on average.
ADVERTISEMENT
But some scientists are questioning why the company would report on a pooled result of two different trials, as it deviates from standard reporting on clinical trials.
And in the days following that announcement, another point of confusion has emerged.
On Tuesday, Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President who heads up non-oncology research and development, first explained to Reuters that a lab error was the reason why some volunteers had received a smaller dose -- the dose that proved to be 90% effective. ""The reason we had the half dose is serendipity,"" Pangalos said, adding that researchers had ""underpredicted the dose of the vaccine by half.""
In a statement on Wednesday, Oxford's communications manager for vaccines told CNN that ""dose selection for any new vaccine is a complicated area, and in exploring methods of dose selection, we discovered one gave a lower dose than expected.""
Oxford elaborated further on Thursday, saying in a statement to CNN that a ""difference in the manufacturing process"" had led to the error.
That manufacturing problem has since been corrected, the statement said, noting that the UK regulator overseeing the trial had agreed to include ""both approaches"" in Phase 3.
While AstraZeneca and Oxford face criticism about transparency -- given that they did not mention the error in their press release announcing the results nor on a press call on Monday -- the company believes the world should focus on the trial's positive results.
Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Menelas Pangalos AstraZeneca's Executive Vice-President said, ""The mistake is actually irrelevant.
""Whichever way you cut the data -- even if you only believe the full-dose, full-dose data... We still have efficacy that meets the thresholds for approval with a vaccine that's over 60% effective,"" Pangalos said, according to the WSJ.
AstraZeneca and Oxford have yet to put forward a candidate for interview, as requested by CNN.
The US Food and Drug Administration requires a threshold of at least 50% efficacy. It is not clear if the FDA will authorize emergency use however.
AstraZeneca has not yet tested its half-strength dose in the US either. But on Thursday, a spokesperson for the company told CNN their aim was to include the half-strength dose regimen into their US trials, which currently has around 10,000 participants.
The spokesperson said that the company hopes to recruit around 40,000 volunteers in total -- some of whom would receive the half-dose vaccine. They added that they were in ""ongoing discussions"" with the FDA for approval, adding that nothing formal had been announced.
On Monday, Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee -- which will review COVID-19 vaccines before they are put on the market -- said the lack of data that led them to their conclusions made it ""hard to know the significance of their findings.""
When two other major drugmakers, Pfizer and Moderna, released their efficacy results earlier this month, they did include the data that led to their results.
AstraZeneca presented an analysis of 23,000 participants in its Phase 3 trial.
It said some participants received the COVID-19 vaccine, while others received a different vaccine for an unrelated virus, or placebo injections.
A total of 131 study participants developed COVID-19, AstraZeneca said, but they did not say how many of those people had received the vaccine.
What also remains unclear is why the two-dose regimes produced such different efficacy measures.
The trial's lead investigator at Oxford, Professor Andrew Pollard told journalists on Monday that's likely to do with the delicate balance of dosing someone just enough to trigger an immune response against the disease.
""What we've always tried to do with a vaccine is fool the immune system into thinking that there's a dangerous infection there that it needs to respond to -- but doing it in a very safe way,"" Pollard explained.
So, it may be that the best way of ""kicking the immune system into action"" could be to give the body a small amount of the vaccine to begin with -- and then follow up with a larger amount, he said.
Responding to whether he had genuine confidence that the half-dose group's 90% success was not just a feature of a small sample size, Pollard said that result was ""highly significant...even with the numbers that we have.""
But experts are questioning whether those results will hold up if more people are given the lower-dose regime.
In a call with reporters on Wednesday, the US vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui said they were reviewing AstraZeneca's vaccine data.
He said that group that got the mistakenly lower dose that yielded the 90% efficacy had been a younger group, with no one older than 55. That could potentially affect the strength of AstraZeneca's findings, given that young people typically produce stronger immune responses to vaccines.
Both Oxford and AstraZeneca told CNN on Thursday they were unable to give a breakdown of the ages of the people who were given the vaccine in that smaller group.
An AstraZeneca spokesperson told CNN on Thursday that, ""given the high efficacy we have now seen with the different dosing regimens, there is strong merit in continuing to further investigate these findings in order to establish the most effective dosing regimen for the vaccine.""
He added that the company is having discussions with regulators around the world to evaluate the findings and that they are looking forward to the publication of peer-reviewed results.
But Dr. Saad Omer, a vaccine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine believes the group with the 90% efficacy rate is relatively small and the results may not stand up when more people are given this regimen.
""I hate to criticize fellow academics, or anyone for that matter,"" he said, ""but releasing information like this is like asking us to try and read the tea leaves.""
On Wednesday, AstraZeneca's stock fell more than 6%.

http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2020/12/18/Pfizer-COVID-vaccines-Philippines-Duque.html,Duque: Pfizer deal does not secure 10 million doses for PH,CNN Philippines Staff,"Dec 18, 2020 3:15:15 PM","Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, December 18) — Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Friday dismissed allegations he caused the delay in the vaccine deal with US drugmaker Pfizer, adding the papers that took him 17 days to sign does not specifically assure 10 million doses for the Philippines by January.
He belied the specifications for supply and shipment mentioned by Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., who brokered the deal with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Philippine Ambassador to the US Babe Romualdez. Locsin said the 10 million doses of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine were supposed to arrive in Clark, Pampanga in January 2021, but someone bungled the deal. Senator Panfilo Lacson identified Duque as the suspect.
Duque said there have been meetings between Philippine officials and Pfizer executives where it was mentioned that US President Donald Trump asked the firm to allot supplies for the Philippines, but the health chief noted that discussions did not include the specific details bared by Locsin.
""I completely, unequivocally deny that. Unang-una, ang 10 million dose na iyan, wala naman akong alam. Wala silang pinadalang sulat na may ganoong commitment ang Pfizer. There was no document. As Secretary of Health, the right thing to do was send me a communication that the Pfizer is securing 10 million doses for the country,"" he told CNN Philippines.
Duque said the confidentiality disclosure agreement or CDA that reached his table was for Pfizer to share vaccine development data to the Philippines so talks on supply and shipment can begin.
""It's not a key to securing any quota or amount of vaccine from Pfizer,"" he stressed.
Bureaucratic red tape?
It took Duque 17 working days before he signed the CDA, a requirement for the two parties to begin advanced talks on vaccine procurement.

Pfizer submitted the draft agreement to the Philippines on August 11, which was meant to be signed by the Office of the Executive Secretary in behalf of the national government. The Department of Health, Department of Science and Technology, and the Office of Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea held several meetings to ""align,"" Duque said. More than a month later, the health secretary said he was informed by Medialdea's office that the DOH will sign for the three agencies. Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said this was decided upon just so they can move forward with the deal.
From receiving the go-signal from OES on September 25, Duque said he signed the CDA on October 20. He added vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also signed it in November. Duque said he has all the documents to prove he did not delay the deal, adding the papers will be part of his report to President Rodrigo Duterte who has asked him to explain in public.

Duque also denied any hint of corruption surrounding the botched deal to buy the Pfizer vaccines, even as senators warned the DOH may face criminal charges for the delayed transaction. He dismissed the allegation of Senator Francis Pangilinan that some officials may have asked for 'kickvacc' (kickback) or commissions from the purchase deal.

Blood serum samples from people who had received two doses of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine “efficiently” neutralized a version of the virus engineered to carry the same mutations as the variant, known as the P.1.
For the study, published by the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday, researchers at Pfizer, BioNTech and the University of Texas Medical Branch genetically engineered the virus to create versions carrying mutations found in a range of coronavirus variants, including P.1.
They tested them against blood samples taken from 15 people 2 or 4 weeks after they had received a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as part of a clinical trial.
The team found that the blood samples were able to neutralize the Brazil variant “roughly” as well as it could neutralize an earlier strain of the virus from January 2020.

The P.1 variant is suspected of fueling a resurgence of coronavirus cases in Brazil. It was found in 42% of samples in one survey carried out in Manaus and cases have since emerged in countries including the US, the UK and Japan.
The P.1 variant has mutations in common with the variant first identified in South Africa that are thought to make it more contagious and possibly able to evade immunity from vaccines -- though this new study suggests the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may still be effective.
Pfizer previously reported findings that blood samples also neutralized variant B.1.351, first reported in South Africa. The study found neutralization was still “robust but lower.""
In February, Pfizer said that there is no evidence in real life that the South African variant escapes the protection offered by its vaccine but that they were working on developing a booster shot and an updated vaccine.
""Nevertheless, Pfizer and BioNTech are taking the necessary steps, making the right investments, and engaging in the appropriate conversations with regulators to be in a position to develop and seek authorization for an updated mRNA vaccine or booster once a strain that significantly reduces the protection from the vaccine is identified,"" Pfizer said in a statement at the time.

CNN has obtained part of a Friday, July 31 email from Moderna, the company running the trial, that states 1,290 people were randomly assigned to get either the vaccine or a dummy shot as of that date. The trial began on Monday, July 27.
The email was sent to sites across the US that are participating in the Moderna trial. Moderna plans to enroll 30,000 people at its 89 sites.
""We hope within a period of a few months, a couple of months, that we'll be able to enroll hopefully by the end of the summer so that we can start getting some results,"" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said July 27 when he announced the start of the Phase 3 trial.
Fauci told CNN that he expects to get an answer about whether the vaccine works in November or December. ""Maybe we'll get an answer as early as October, but I doubt it,"" he said.
If the pace of enrollment in the first week of the trial -- 1,290 over five days -- were to continue, the study wouldn't be fully enrolled until late fall or early winter. But Fauci told CNN he expects the enrollment numbers to increase as the study continues.
""The first week had very few sites activated,"" he said. ""As more sites get activated, enrollment will very likely increase significantly.""
Each participant receives two injections spaced about 28 days apart.
In a statement, Moderna said they are ""on track to complete enrollment in September, 2020. The company will provide an update when enrollment is complete.""
At the July 27 briefing, Fauci said he hoped for much higher enrollment numbers -- but he now says he was joking.
""We'd like to have 15,000 by the end of the week. I'm not sure that we're going to get there, but hopefully we'll get as many as we possibly can in order to keep our timelines where we need to be,"" Fauci said at the briefing.
But Thursday he told CNN he meant that ""tongue-in-cheek.""
More than 310,000 people have registered with the the COVID-19 Prevention Network to take part in clinical trials for a vaccine or monoclonal antibody treatment for coronavirus. The group is aiming to register ""millions"" of people, according to Dr. Jim Kublin, executive director of operations for the network.
President Trump said Thursday that he was ""optimistic"" a vaccine would be ready around election day on November 3.
""I believe we'll have the vaccine before the end of the year, certainly, but around that date, yes. I think so,"" Trump told reporters. On Monday, Trump said ""we're on pace to have a vaccine available this year, maybe far in advance of the end of the year.""

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/12/18/Moderna-US-FDA-COVID-vaccine-authorization.html,US FDA panel recommends Moderna's vaccine as country surpasses 17 million official COVID-19 cases,Christina Maxouris and Jason Hanna,"Dec 18, 2020 6:32:54 AM","(CNN) — As the United States on Thursday surpassed 17 million official Covid-19 cases, a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended a second coronavirus vaccine for the country.
The developments come as the US, after starting distribution of its first authorized vaccine this week, is dealing with record rates of daily cases, daily deaths and numbers of Covid-19 patients in hospitals.
The FDA is widely expected to grant emergency use authorization for Moderna's vaccine candidate -- as it did for Pfizer's vaccine last week -- after its vaccine advisory panel voted to recommend it.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would need to greenlight the vaccine before shots can be administered -- and a CDC advisory panel is expected to meet on the matter Saturday, raising the possibility that the Moderna vaccine could be used next week.
The recently authorized Pfizer vaccine, meanwhile, has been administered to hundreds of US health care workers this week, and drug store chains CVS and Walgreens are helping to get shots to long-term care residents and staff members.
But as vaccinations begin, recorded cases, hospitalizations and deaths are rising to levels not previously seen, as hospital staff around the country warn they're running out of space and energy to provide sufficient care:
• Average cases: The country's average number of daily cases across a week was 215,729 on Wednesday -- a record high, Johns Hopkins University data show. That's more than three times what the daily case average was during a summer peak in July.
ADVERTISEMENT
• Cases in one day: The US recorded 247,403 cases on Wednesday, a record for one day.
• Deaths: The nation averaged 2,569 deaths daily across the last week -- the highest average yet. The total reported Wednesday -- 3,656 -- is a one-day high.
• Hospitalizations: 113,090 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals Wednesday -- the most recorded on a given day, according to the COVID Tracking Project.
The White House coronavirus task force warned this week that although spread has slowed somewhat in the northern and central US, cases are still surging in more populated states.
And it lamented that state and local governments are ""not implementing the same mitigation policies that stemmed the tide of the summer surge,"" citing indoor gatherings at home and calling for a ""significant reduction in capacity or closure in public and private indoor spaces, including restaurants and bars.""
Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of Emory University's school of medicine, said he agreed.
""We're just simply saying, 'Well, we're getting vaccine.' But the vaccine is coming way too late for thousands of people who will die before we get the vaccine"" distributed widely,"" del Rio told CNN's New Day"" on Thursday.
""Transmissions (of the virus) are actively happening, and I think before the end of the year, we may be getting close to 4,000 deaths a day,"" del Rio said.
The country's total official case count stood at more than 17,149,231 on Thursday afternoon, according to JHU, only five days after the count surpassed 16 million and just hours after passing the 17 million mark. But researchers have said the actual number of US infections -- counting those that weren't tested for -- probably is many millions higher.
'We are still in for a very rough few weeks at least'
Health experts have said Americans have important choices to make: The upcoming holidays could help drive another surge of cases, hospitalizations and, inevitably, deaths, if people opt to travel and gather again.
Despite a warning from the CDC before Thanksgiving urging against travel, more than 4 million spent the holiday away from home.
In California, Los Angeles County has frequently broken records for new daily cases, hospitalizations and daily deaths in recent weeks. On Thursday, about 65% of the county's hospitals were on ""diversion,"" meaning they could no longer accept new patients and had to direct incoming ambulances to other facilities.
Health Director Barbara Ferrer attributed the surges to residents gathering over the Thanksgiving holiday, despite repeated pleas to stay home.
""This is a post-holiday surge that doesn't need to be,"" Ferrer told CNN. ""This is a lot of intermingling that needn't have happened.""
And the worst is yet to come, county health services director Dr. Christina Ghaly said earlier this week. ""We are still in for a very rough few weeks at least, and potentially through January,"" Ghaly said.
By late Thursday, four of five California regions will officially be under a state-mandated stay-at-home order, because intensive-care unit capacity in those regions fell below 15%.
Three regions fell under the order earlier this month, and it officially goes into effect in the fourth -- the entire San Fransciso Bay Area -- at 11:59 p.m. PT, after the ICU capacity fell below the threshold this week, state officials said.
Officials in much of the Bay Area preemptively ordered their residents to stay home earlier this month because the capacity was dropping. But this week's data puts the entire region under the state order, which now covers all of the state except a mostly rural region stretching from north of Sacramento to the Oregon state line.
Governors across the Northeast and Midwest, meanwhile, issued a video message this week encouraging residents to ""double down"" on safety measures and reconsider their holiday plans.
""If you are planning to travel or gather with other households for the holidays -- we urge you to reconsider,"" the governors said. ""Just one infection can cause an outbreak in your community, which could overwhelm our hospitals and put you and your loved ones at risk.""
In hopes of helping curb the spread around the holidays, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego announced curfews from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. lasting from December 23 to December 26 and from December 30 to January 4.
""What people need to know is, we are still at a dangerous and critical part of this pandemic, and tens of thousands of American lives are at stake,"" Adm. Dr. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services, said Wednesday.
""If you can avoid traveling, that's a good measure,"" he added.
It's OK to squeeze extra dozes of Pfizer vaccine from the vials, FDA says
As for the Pfizer vaccine, the FDA said people administering it may squeeze out extra doses from the vials if there is leftover solution in them after giving the standard five doses.
Politico was first to report that some pharmacists found they could get six -- and possibly even seven -- doses of vaccine out of vials, which are each designed to provide five doses. An FDA spokeswoman told CNN the agency was aware of the issue and ""working with Pfizer to determine the best path forward.""
""At this time, given the public health emergency, FDA is advising that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh) from each vial, pending resolution of the issue,"" the spokeswoman said. ""However, since the vials are preservative-free, it is critical to note that any further remaining product that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one.""
More than 2.9 million doses were allocated to states for the first Pfizer vaccine doses, according to a list published Wednesday by the CDC.
The Pfizer vaccine requires each patient to receive two doses about 21 days apart, and the Moderna vaccine also would require two doses. Assuming the Moderna vaccine is authorized, the two products could combine for an availability of 40 million doses, for 20 million people, by the end of December, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said.",CNN,2020-12-18 06:32:54,"(CNN) — As the United States on Thursday surpassed 17 million official Covid-19 cases, a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended a second coronavirus vaccine for the country.But as vaccinations begin, recorded cases, hospitalizations and deaths are rising to levels not previously seen, as hospital staff around the country warn they're running out of space and energy to provide sufficient care: • Average cases: The country's average number of daily cases across a week was 215,729 on Wednesday -- a record high, Johns Hopkins University data show.But the vaccine is coming way too late for thousands of people who will die before we get the vaccine"" distributed widely,"" del Rio told CNN's New Day"" on Thursday.'We are still in for a very rough few weeks at least' Health experts have said Americans have important choices to make: The upcoming holidays could help drive another surge of cases, hospitalizations and, inevitably, deaths, if people opt to travel and gather again.""This is a post-holiday surge that doesn't need to be,"" Ferrer told CNN.""At this time, given the public health emergency, FDA is advising that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh) from each vial, pending resolution of the issue,"" the spokeswoman said.More than 2.9 million doses were allocated to states for the first Pfizer vaccine doses, according to a list published Wednesday by the CDC.",3.0,0.880299985408783,"dose, duterte, get, arrive, coronavirus, astrazeneca, pfizer, first, country, palace","['panel', 'recommend', 'country', 'surpass', 'official', 'case']",0.3612,0.0,0.667,0.333,0.0,Positive

Speaking to CNN Philippines' The Source on Tuesday, AFP spokesperson Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo urged the country's regulatory bodies to speed up their screening process and make the vaccine readily available for the public, including the military personnel, whom he repeatedly described as ""frontliners.""
""We hope that the other agencies of the government in charge of the regulation will fast-track the so-called emergency use authorization so that there will be no more issues with regard to the administration of the vaccine because it is very essential and necessary, especially to the members of the AFP, who will be performing their duties in the frontlines,"" Arevalo said.
He added that the military is willing to follow regulations, but ""owing to the nature of their duties and responsibilities,"" regulators must ""take the lead"" in the provision of vaccines for them.

""If it comes necessary that we perform our duties as frontliners when the vaccines are already available, hopefully the other agencies of government that are in charge with the regulation would be the one to take the lead and would make the vaccine available to the military personnel who would be facing the frontlines,"" Arevalo said.
The military has recently drawn flak after admitting that members of the Presidential Security Group were inoculated against the virus. The FDA has not yet authorized any COVID-19 vaccine for rollout in the Philippines.
Uniformed personnel are supposed to be fifth in line among other groups prioritized for vaccination, following health workers, senior citizens, indigent senior citizens, and the rest of the indigent population.

Arevalo then defended the PSG, noting that part of their job is to protect Duterte, the chief executive and their commander-in-chief. He also stressed that the PSG should be acknowledged for taking the risks that come with getting the doses in advance.
""What we should look into is the recognition given, that we should accord to some members of the PSG because they themselves are aware of the risks involved. Be that as it may, in their duty to the President, they are willing to take the risk,"" he noted.
The AFP spokesperson then clarified that only the closed-in security and official escorts within the PSG, headed by BGen. Jesus Durante, received the doses. The ones in charge of the legal aspect of the issue should just discuss the matter further, he added.
Arevalo reiterated that he is not privy to the inoculation process, the type of vaccine received, and how it was given to the PSG. Other top officials and members of the AFP, including him, have not yet received the vaccine.
It was Duterte himself who bared in a Cabinet meeting on Saturday that some soldiers received Chinese vaccine Sinopharm, which does not have a regulatory approval to be distributed or administered in the Philippines.
Interior Secretary Eduardo Año then raised in a radio interview on Monday that he knows some PSG and even Cabinet members who got the unauthorized vaccine. Philippine Army chief Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana also confirmed this in a separate radio interview that some military men already got vaccinated, under Duterte's orders.

FDA Director General Eric Domingo reiterated in a statement the agency's warning against the use of unauthorized vaccines, saying their safety, quality, and efficacy are not guaranteed.
Authorities under the Department of Science and Technology, the Department of Health, and the FDA are responsible for ensuring that vaccine candidates meet good clinical standards and conduct tests in an ethical manner.
Aside from China's Sinovac which was reported to have a 50% efficacy rate, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said the country's current deals are with American corporation Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer which recorded a 95% efficacy rate, British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca, Russia's Gamaleya Institute and India's Novavax.
Johnson & Johnson's Janssen COVID-19 vaccine was just approved for its clinical trials in the Philippines as of Tuesday, according to the FDA.

“Hindi necessarily causal ang relationship. Hindi dahil lang sumunod sa pagbabakuna ay galing na sa bakuna ang naramdaman,” Dr. Anna Ong-Lim said in a briefing.
[Translation: The relationship between a vaccine and an adverse event is not necessarily causal. Just because you experienced something after the immunization, it does not mean you got it from the vaccine.]
Possible reason
The expert explained that prior to vaccination, a person may have been exposed to an individual who is ill, and only started exhibiting symptoms after getting the shot.
“Yung iba, kung nagkataon na mayroon na silang exposure sa ibang mga taong nagkasakit, at nagsisimula pa lamang iyong sakit, pwedeng may maramdaman sila after that. Akala nila dahil sa bakuna when in fact na expose pala sila sa taong may nararamdaman at nahawaan sila ng sakit,” she said.

They think the side effects are due to the vaccine, when in fact they have been infected with a disease beforehand.]
Some diseases have incubation periods. For example, the incubation period of COVID-19 is up to 14 days. This means the symptoms could appear two weeks after a person has been exposed to the coronavirus.

Ong-Lim, citing studies, said adverse reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine usually occur 15 minutes after a person received the shot.
She said they will be on the lookout for vaccine recipients who might experience anaphylaxis or severe allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines once the immunization program starts. Some people in other countries have experienced severe allergies after they were inoculated against coronavirus.

Researchers used PCR tests to screen for coronavirus in vaccinated and non-vaccinated Cambridge University Hospitals health care workers who reported to work feeling well.
Unvaccinated health care workers were positive for coronavirus in 0.80% of tests; vaccinated health care workers less than 12 days from a single dose were positive in 0.37% of tests; and vaccinated health care workers who were at least 12 days out from one dose were positive in 0.20% of tests.
The study, led by Cambridge researchers, has not yet been published or peer-reviewed, but the authors call it “real-world evidence for a high level of protection against asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection” from a single dose of the vaccine. They noted that the more transmissible B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the United Kingdom, dominated at the time of their research, and prior infection was relatively low among the population tested.
A large study released this week by Public Health England (PHE) found that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine “provides high levels of protection against infection and symptomatic disease,” reducing the risk of infection by 72% after three weeks, while two vaccine doses reduced the risk of infection by 85%. PHE's Siren Study involved health care workers younger than 65.
“These studies are very encouraging because they suggest that the vaccines will prevent the spread of the virus,” Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Warwick Medical School, said in a response to the Science Media Centre in the UK. “You can’t spread the virus if you’re not infected and these studies show that the vaccine blocks infection in individuals who don’t have symptoms but could pass on the infection.”

Instead, they should wear a mask — which is probably even more effective, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
While a ""very limited supply"" of a Covid-19 vaccine might be ready in November or December, it ""will have to be prioritized,"" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told a Senate appropriations subcommittee Wednesday.
""It will be those first responders and those at greatest risk for death, and then eventually that will expand,"" he said.
""If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public, so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we're probably looking at third, late second quarter, third quarter 2021.""

On top of that, ""in order to have enough of us immunized so we have immunity, I think it's going to take us six to nine months,"" he said.
Vaccine distrust remains an issue
Then there's the issue that needs to be urgently addressed: people who are hesitant to get the vaccine, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Wednesday.
""Those who are vaccine hesitant have had their hesitancy enhanced by a variety of things that are happening right now, particularly the unfortunate mix of science and politics,"" Collins said at an event hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.
A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than half of respondents -- 54% -- said they would not get the vaccine if it was available for free before the November 3 presidential election. Along party lines, 60% of Republicans and 56% of independents said they would not. Half of Democrats said they would.
""I don't want to have us, a year from now, having a conversation about how we have in our hands the solution to the worst pandemic of more than 100 years, but we haven't been able to actually convince people to take charge of it,"" Collins said.
And distrust in government agencies is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spread, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.
""It is very challenging in many areas today, where we're seeing people who do not want to participate in any kind of follow up with regard to surveillance, because of their distrust of government and the public health system,"" c said during an American Public Health Association webinar.
Surveillance helps public health officials by collecting information on infected people, such as where they were exposed and who they've been in contact with, and the course of their illness.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, said the variability in how the coronavirus affects people has helped fuel misunderstandings about who can spread the virus and when.
At least 40% of patients have no symptoms, while some stay ill for months on end, Fauci said.
""One of the things we're dealing with in this country is a real lack of understanding of the importance of everybody trying to prevent getting infected rather than inadvertently... propagating the outbreak..."" Fauci said during a virtual panel sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.
Of all the viral diseases and emerging infections that he's encountered throughout his career, Fauci said he has ""never seen anything with a range"" like this virus.
""It's just completely unique to see that degree of variability of a single microbe, which means there are things that are determining that, that we still at this point don't understand,"" he said.
Masks are a 'powerful' tool, Redfield said
But Redfield said Americans already have a weapon he believes could be more effective against Covid-19: face masks.
""These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have,"" Redfield said, holding up a blue face mask.
""If we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks, we'd bring this pandemic under control,"" he said.
""I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take a Covid vaccine, because the immunogenicity may be 70%. And if I don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me. This face mask will.""
Yet time and again, people gather and socialize without wearing face masks -- sometimes leading to tragic results.
More than 6.6 million people have been infected with Covid-19 in the US, and more than 196,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
7 coronavirus deaths are linked to 1 wedding
A wedding in Maine is linked to 176 Covid-19 cases and the deaths of seven people who didn't attend the celebration -- showing just how easily and quickly coronavirus can spread at social gatherings, public health experts say.
For months, doctors have stressed the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings.
But outbreaks have stemmed from Memorial Day events, Fourth of July celebrations and a massive motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.
The wedding in Millinocket on August 7 had about 65 guests, a violation of the state's 50-person limit for indoor events, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The event is linked to outbreaks that have unfolded at a nursing home and a jail, both more than 100 miles away from the wedding venue, among people who had only secondary or tertiary contact with an attendee.
Residents at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center accounted for 39 cases tied to the wedding and six of the seven deaths thus far, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said.
""The virus favors gatherings,"" Shah added. ""It does not distinguish between happy events like a wedding celebration, or sad farewells, like a funeral.""
Despite such somber warnings, about 1,500 people descended on a New Jersey boardwalk house featured in MTV's ""Jersey Shore"" on Monday night, ending in eight arrests, Seaside Heights police said.
The event was organized by a group of YouTube pranksters, according to Seaside Heights Police Detective Steve Korman, and officials say they are now worried about how they will track possible infections among more than a thousand people.
Universities try to get ahead of outbreaks
Outbreaks keep cropping up at colleges and universities, prompting some to go to virtual learning again.
More than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported at colleges and universities in all 50 states.
Citing a significant rise in cases among students, the University of Colorado Boulder announced a 14-day quarantine period for students living within the city.
The University of Arizona is taking a similar approach, urging students to shelter in place until the end of the month after a large number of positive cases. The university reported 261 positive cases on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard.
At the University of Missouri, two students were expelled and three were suspended for violating rules that require students who test positive to isolate and comply with social distancing.
""These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable. We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students,"" the university said in a statement Tuesday
Returning to normal is a long way off
Officials are trying to prepare the public for a pandemic-altered life for a few more months -- if not years.
Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief science officer at the World Health Organization in Geneva, said the world might not be able to return to ""pre-Covid"" life until 2022.
Swaminathan said 60% to 70% of the global population would need to have immunity before there is a dramatic reduction in transmission of the virus.
""We're looking at 2022 at least before enough people start getting the vaccine to build immunity,"" she told journalists during a virtual meeting hosted by the United Nations Foundation.
""So for a long time to come, we have to maintain the same kind of measures that are currently being put in place with physical distancing, the masking and respiratory hygiene.""

Northwell Health, which administered the vaccine, donated the vial from intensive care unit nurse Sandra Lindsay's Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination.
It also donated her vaccination record card, her scrubs, and her hospital identification badge. Lindsay is the first person known to have received the vaccine following its authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration in December.
Along with Lindsay's vaccine vial, the Smithsonian received vials from other Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. It also received syringes, diluents, and vaccination records related to the administration process.

Northwell also gifted the Smithsonian artifacts involved in the shipping process of the vaccines and objects that helped maintain and monitor its temperature.
""Dec. 14 was a historic moment for all: the day the very first COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the United States,"" said Michael Dowling, president and CEO of Northwell Health, according to a Smithsonian news release.
""It was our first real sign of hope after so many dark months in the fight against the global pandemic. ...

It was an extraordinary moment, and I thank the Smithsonian for preserving this important milestone,"" Dowling said.
The museum formed a task force in April 2020 aimed at chronicling events from the past year as well as documenting the effects the pandemic has had on businesses, work, politics, and culture, the Smithsonian release reads. Earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci donated to the museum his personal 3D model that he would often bring to meetings and press conferences to help explain the coronavirus.
""The urgent need for effective vaccines in the U.S. was met with unprecedented speed and emergency review and approval,"" said Anthea M. Hartig, the museum's Elizabeth MacMillan director, according to the Smithsonian release.
""These now historic artifacts document not only this remarkable scientific progress but represent the hope offered to millions living through the cascading crises brought on by COVID-19.""

During a Senate session on Wednesday, budget sponsor Senator Sonny Angara was hounded by repeated questions on the estimated number of vaccine recipients for 2021.
""Hindi pa po maliwanag [It is still unclear],"" he responded.
The Senate finance committee chairman said the bicameral conference committee, which also approved the House and Senate versions of the 2021 budget on the same day, were not told of the government's detailed plans for coronavirus vaccination.
""I guess what is important is we have provided the appropriation cover for the government....and we've given them the power to act, although we're not quite sure how they will utilize these funds,"" Angara admitted.
The senator, however, did present estimates based on the market prices of the different vaccines touted worldwide. For example, the United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca vaccine that is valued at ₱610 pesos has an estimated number of recipients in the country of over 135 million people, with two doses each.
The actual number, as well as the logistical expenses, would still depend on which vaccine brands the government chooses to buy, Angara said. So far, officials have shared that AstraZeneca and China-based Sinovac are nearing trials in the Philippines.

""I think I heard from our vaccine czar Charlie Galvez that the initial doses will come from AstraZeneca...but I also heard about negotiations with other pharmaceuticals,"" said Angara. ""But...I don't have personal knowledge of these negotiations.""
Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto lamented that Congress was not privy to the government's vaccination plans during the bicam deliberations.
""I was hoping the Executive during the bicam would talk to both chairs,"" said Recto. ""I was thinking they would be making a request more so today that we see rollout has begun and you need to make advanced payments for these vaccines. May pila 'yan [There is a queue].""
Health Department budget sponsor Senator Pia Cayetano also said she received information that the vaccine budget may only be able to cover about 25% of the population, far from the needed 60% to achieve herd immunity.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon and Senator Richard Gordon said they also would have wanted to see a vaccine roadmap, which Galvez said last month was already up for the President's approval.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2021/1/13/sinovac-covid-vaccine-efficacy.html,"Chinese Covid-19 vaccine far less effective than initially claimed in Brazil, sparking concerns",Nectar Gan and Tatiana Arias,"Jan 13, 2021 7:18:42 PM","(CNN) -- A leading Chinese Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech was just 50.38% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil, significantly lower than earlier results showed, according to a statement published by the government of Sao Paulo Tuesday.
While the number exceeds the threshold required for regulatory approval, it falls far below the 78% previously announced, raising questions as to the veracity of the data and fueling skepticism over the apparent lack of transparency regarding Chinese vaccines.
Analysts said the efficacy rate of Sinovac's Coronavac vaccine in Brazil -- the lowest among its global competitors -- could affect international confidence in Chinese-made vaccines and hamper Beijing's effort to repair its image from its early mishandling of the initial outbreak by providing Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries.
""The Butantan Institute and the Government of Sao Paulo report that the coronavirus vaccine achieved a 50.38% overall efficacy rate in the clinical study conducted in Brazil, in addition to (an efficacy rate of) 78% for mild cases and 100% for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19. All rates are higher than the 50% level required by the WHO (World Health Organization),"" the statement released Tuesday said.
The razor-thin margin for regulatory approval is likely to lead to concern among scientists, given that last week the Butantan institute released partial ""clinical efficacy"" results celebrating 78% to 100% efficacy in preventing infections.
The state body financed the phase 3 trials of the vaccine, which involved 13,000 health workers across eight Brazilian states.
""Regarding the overall efficacy of the analysis, we met the requirements of the World Health Organization with 50.38%,"" Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at the Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo said Tuesday during a news conference.
ADVERTISEMENT
However, on Tuesday, high-ranking members of the Brazilian Health Ministry told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil that ""the effectiveness is borderline,"" and that because ""It is at the limit. We have to wait for ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) to evaluate.""
A representative of Sinovac said the company is discussing the result but declined to give further comment. The final efficacy rate of the vaccine will be determined by China's drug regulator, the National Medical Production Administration, according to the representative.
Potential stumbling block
Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the US based Council on Foreign Relations, described the 50.38% efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine as a ""disappointing"" result that had caught him by surprise.
The results suggest Coronavac is less effective than alternative vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have an efficacy rate of about 95%.
Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 91% effective, while the UK's vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has an average efficacy of 70%.
The Sinovac vaccine is also less effective than its domestic Chinese competitor, developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, which it says is 79.34% effective.
Despite the worse than anticipated results, Huang said the Sinovac vaccine would still be ""usable"" by helping to relieve pressures on healthcare systems while reducing potential deaths, given its higher efficacy for moderate and severe cases that would require medical treatment.
However, its low overall efficacy could hinder Sinovac's ability to expand its market share globally, Huang said.
Sinovac has signed deals to provide 46 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to Brazil, 50 million doses to Turkey and 7.5 million doses to Hong Kong. It'll also supply 40 million doses of vaccine bulk -- the vaccine concentrate before it is divided into vials -- to Indonesia for local production.
""Since many countries are planning to order, or have already ordered Sinovac's vaccines, it might undermine people's willingness to take them, because people may question the usefulness of the vaccines,"" Huang said. ""It could be a potential stumbling block.""
Lack of transparency
A lack of transparency has been a major concern clouding Chinese-made vaccines, which Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to make ""a global public good.""
Both Sinovac and Sinopharm have faced questions regarding the release of data. When announcing its efficacy results, state-owned Sinopharm did not provide details on its clinical trial data. A Sinopharm executive said detailed data would be released later and published in scientific journals, without giving a timeline.
There is also the issue of discrepancy in results from clinical trials conducted in different places.
Having largely eliminated the coronavirus inside its borders earlier last year, Chinese drugmakers had to look abroad for places to test the efficacy of their vaccines. But the results reported so far are far from consistent.
Sinopharm's efficacy rate of 79%, for example, is lower than the 86% announced by the United Arab Emirates for the same vaccine in December.
Sinovac's vaccine has had wildly different results from three countries: Indonesian drug regulators say interim data from Phase 3 trials showed it is 65.3% effective and gave it the country's first emergency use approval; Turkey says it is 91.25% effective; And in Brazil, the two significantly different efficacy rates announced a week apart have further sparked questions.
Last week, Brazil's health regulator agency ANVISA told the Butantan Institute that in order to approve the emergency use of a vaccine, the global efficacy rate had to be made publicly available -- information the Institute had not received at the time from Sinovac, according to CNN Brasil sources.
ANVISA will meet on Sunday to decide on two requests for emergency use of both the Coronavac vaccine and the Oxford University AstraZeneca vaccine.
Domestic expectations
The news could potentially hinder China's own coronavirus vaccination drive too, Huang warned.
China has inoculated tens of thousands of people with Sinovac's vaccine since July under a government-approved emergency use program, which includes at least three Chinese vaccine candidates.
In total, it has administered 4.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine under emergency use, and is planning to vaccinate 50 million people ahead of February's Lunar New Year celebrations.
Chinese public health experts have repeatedly told the public they are confident that Chinese-made vaccines are at least as good as, if not better, than foreign alternatives, Huang said.
""If people learn about this, they might start to question the safety and efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine, or even other Chinese-made vaccines,"" Huang said. ""I think the government will need to do some convincing work, on either those who have already taken the shots, or are about to do so.""

In a statement, AFP spokesperson Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo said the PSG, ""primarily tasked to protect and secure the highest official of the land,"" already got vaccinated. He did not disclose what vaccines were provided and how they were administered.
""Because the safety of the President equates to national well-being, that security posture should necessarily include protecting the Commander-in-Chief from contracting the deadly virus from those he is constantly exposed to like the members of his security detail,"" Arevalo said, noting that the members, headed by BGen. Jesus Durante, have taken a bold step ""to try the vaccine.""
Arevalo earlier said during the Laging Handa briefing they have yet to verify reports about the vaccination and stressed ""there is no AFP-sanctioned inoculation"" among their members.
No less than Duterte himself claimed over the weekend that many Filipinos, including some military men, already received the still-unregulated Chinese vaccine Sinopharm, even without regulation from the Food and Drug Authority.
Arevalo then proceeded to thank Duterte for including the military in the first groups that will receive doses next to health workers, senior citizens, and indigent population in the country.

In a message to CNN Philippines on Monday night, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said he has not received the vaccine, but the PSG received theirs in advance.
""I have not been vaccinated... I can confirm that the whole PSG had their vaccination several weeks ago. Other soldiers have not been vaccinated,"" he said.
It was Interior Secretary Eduardo Año who first raised in a radio interview on Monday that he knows some PSG and Cabinet members who have also been inoculated against the virus.
Meanwhile, in his noontime briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque defended the military's use of unregistered vaccines and noted they were likely donated by an unidentified source.
Health experts over the weekend warned the public against the use of unregistered vaccines, with possible dangers including lack of knowledge about the injected product that would make it difficult for physicians to treat patients who may experience negative reactions.
So far, the FDA has not yet authorized any COVID-19 vaccine for rollout in the Philippines. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez previously told Duterte the country is also working out deals with more Western vaccine developers aside from China's Sinovac which was reported to have a 50% efficacy rate.
American corporation Johnson & Johnson, British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca, Russia's Gamaleya Institute, and India's Novavax are among developers with current candidate vaccines for next year's vaccination, he said.
US-based drug manufacturer Pfizer, which recorded a 95% efficacy rate, has also applied for emergency use authorization of its coronavirus vaccine in the country.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Western countries like those in Europe and the United States are using a large bulk of COVID-19 vaccines produced by several pharmaceutical firms.

The first batch of vaccines expected to arrive in the country are 117,000 doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine from the World Health Organization's vaccine-sharing facility COVAX. The delivery is facings delay because the government is still finalizing details of the indemnity agreement with the international health body.

At a number of concierge medical practices in Southern California, doctors say they've received calls from their well-off clients asking if they can have early access to the extremely limited supply of vaccine doses in exchange for a financial contribution to a hospital or charity.
Dr. Jeff Toll, whose boutique internal medicine practice has admitting privileges at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said one patient offered to donate $25,000 to the hospital in exchange for an early shot of the vaccine. Toll's practice services a well-heeled clientele that includes chief executives and entertainment figures, but the doctor said he is telling his patients they too must wait as the first round of vaccines are distributed to those most in need of protection.
Earlier this week, California received 327,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, administering the first shots to front line health care workers battling the virus that has caused more than 22,000 deaths statewide since the start of the pandemic.

""I think one of the difficult things is for physicians who take care of these high-power people to be able to say, no you have to wait,"" Toll said. ""These people don't usually have to wait.""
Toll said his practice has applied with the state of California to become a vaccine distribution center for his clients and has already purchased special ultra-cold freezers in anticipation of storing vials of the Pfizer vaccine.
'They wanted it yesterday'
Dr. David Nazarian, of My Concierge MD in Beverly Hills, said a number of his A-list clients are contacting him, saying that money is no object if it helps them get the vaccine early.
""They wanted it yesterday,"" said Nazarian. ""We will play by the rules but are doing everything we can to secure and distribute the vaccine when its available to us.""
Southern California has in recent weeks seen an unprecedented surge of new Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations, with hospital intensive care bed capacity plunging to 0% and health officials issuing dire warnings if the virus continues to spread out of control.
The founder of Concierge MD LA, Dr. Abe Malkin, said he's received over a hundred phone calls from people trying to get early access to the initial doses.
""I'd say that 5 to 10 percent of those were willing to try to make some contribution to a charity to get themselves bumped up in line,"" according to Malkin.
Malkin's practice has also applied to become a vaccine distributor but is focusing on the newly FDA-authorized Moderna vaccine, which will be easier to handle because it doesn't have the same extreme temperature storage requirements as the Pfizer doses.
When it comes cutting in line, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has warned the state will be ""very aggressive in making sure that those with means, those with influence, are not crowding out those that are most deserving of the vaccines.""
""To those that think they can get ahead of the line, and those that think because they have resources, or they have relationships that will allow them to do it. We will be monitoring that very, very, closely,"" Newsom said this month.
""We will prioritize, and we will expect that everyone in the health care delivery system is held to the same ethical standard of prioritizing truly, those that are most in need. And the real heroes in this pandemic are front line health care workers, and those are the folks that we must protect, and we must prioritize moving forward.""

""Of course, our President is our commander-in-chief sa AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines). I should say it's from the chain of command of the Armed Forces,"" Philippine Army Chief Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana said in an interview over DWIZ, when asked if the decision to vaccinate some military men came from higher-ups in the AFP or Malacañang.
Army Spokesman Col. Demy Zagala also told CNN Philippines the ""vaccination occurred by the direction of the chain of command, headed by our commander-in-chief, the President.""
This is contrary, however, to what Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in a noontime briefing. When asked if the go signal came from the President, Roque said, ""I don't think so po. It must have been the decision of the commanders and the soldiers.""
In his address to the nation Saturday, Duterte bared that a number of military men already received the Chinese vaccine Sinopharm, which has not yet been given regulatory approval by the country's Food and Drug Administration.
Sobejana confirmed some AFP members have been vaccinated, but added he doesn't know from which firm the vaccines are.
Meanwhile, Presidential Security Group Commander Jesus Durante III said Duterte's close-in security personnel were the first ones among military men to be immunized. This is to ensure members of the PSG ""are not themselves threat to the President's health and safety,"" Durante said.

Besides the military, some unnamed Cabinet officials have also been vaccinated, according to Interior Secretary Eduardo Año.
Following these reports, FDA Director General Eric Domingo reiterated in a statement the agency's warning against the use of unauthorized vaccines, saying their safety, quality, and efficacy are not guaranteed.
""Vaccines will only be approved if there is reasonable scientific evidence to show that benefit outweighs risk,"" Domingo stressed.

But Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque defended the military, saying soldiers willingly received the vaccines. He also noted that the vaccines were likely donated by an unidentified source.
In the vaccination road map laid out by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., troops and police are fifth in line to receive vaccines. Frontline health workers were supposed to be the first priority in the program. They are followed by indigent senior citizens, other senior citizens, remaining indigent population, then the uniformed personnel — as constantly reiterated by Duterte. With the recent development, troops were bumped up to receive the first doses of vaccines that reached the Philippines.

The delivery of the Philippines' initial COVID-19 vaccine doses has been delayed due to different issues faced by government officials and manufacturers.
The arrival of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines — initially thought to be the first batch of vaccines to reach the country on Feb. 13 through the COVAX facility — faced delays due to the hiccups on the required submission of an indemnification agreement. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said officials were caught off-guard when Pfizer at the last minute asked for a bilateral agreement on their indemnification clause.
China's donation of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines are slated to arrive on Feb. 23, however, it cannot be shipped yet since it has not received an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration.

The biotech, which has received funding from the United States' Operation Warp Speed program, also said it had about $400 million of customer deposits for a potential supply of its mRNA-1273 vaccine.
Moderna made the announcement in its earnings release Wednesday morning. The company posted a loss that was smaller than expected but revenue that topped forecasts.
Shares of Moderna fell about 2% on the news, but the stock has soared more than 300% this year on hopes that it will be able to develop a successful coronavirus vaccine. The company has also come under scrutiny from some investors as several insiders have sold stock as it has surged.

But Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel vowed during a conference call with analysts that its vaccine would be affordable.
""We are working with governments around the world and others to ensure the vaccine is accessible regardless of ability to pay. And we will be responsible on price...during the pandemic,"" Bancel said, adding that deals for smaller amounts of the vaccine have so far cost between $32 and $37 per dose and that Moderna would charge lower prices for higher volumes of mRNA-1273.

Lacson said the government would have secured the delivery of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine if not for Duque’s “indifference,” after he “failed to work on the necessary documentary requirement.”
“The country representative of Pfizer was even following up on the submission of such documentary requirement,” said Lacson in a statement.
Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. on Tuesday tweeted that he and Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez were able to secure millions of vaccine doses to arrive in the country by January 2021, but plans were foiled because ""someone dropped the ball."" Romualdez said the vaccine arrival will most likely be delayed by a few months because other nations were able to finalize deals earlier than the Philippines.
""Only pushed back to later date of delivery possibly June next year because we did (not) act quick enough on the CDA (Confidential Disclosure Agreement). Other countries got ahead of us like Singapore,"" Romualdez said in a text message to CNN Philippines.
Duque, however, refuted Locsin's claim.
ADVERTISEMENT
""There is no such thing as 'dropping of the ball.' The negotiations are ongoing,"" Duque said in a virtual media briefing.
Lacson, who talked to Locsin and Romualdez during a hearing of the Commission on Appointments, earlier hinted that a Cabinet official placed the vaccine deal in danger. He said this official made the Philippines miss the opportunity of receiving vaccines as early as January.
He added that the ""captain ball"" always messes up but stays in power because the ""coach refuses to replace him.""
“Secretary Duque’s reaction that negotiation with Pfizer is still ongoing after he branded as false Secretary Locsin’s statement that somebody dropped the ball is true but such negotiation, according to Ambassador Romualdez, is a renewed initiative after they missed the bus the first time,” said Lacson in a statement.
“The more important question is, how many lives would be saved between January and when (if at all) the vaccines may be made available again to Filipinos,” he added.
 Lacson has repeatedly called for the firing of Duque over alleged lapses on the country's COVID-19 response, but President Rodrigo Duterte has always vouched for the secretary.
Related: Lacson to Duterte: What ‘amulet, magic potion’ does Duque have for staying in office?
Moreover, Duque insisted that he has completed his office's role in finalizing the confidentiality disclosure agreement for vaccine purchase. He said his office was advised on September 24 to review the deal and that he signed it on October 20. The health chief said he meticulously reviewed the papers — even seeking help from legal experts — for possible onerous provisions in the agreement.
""I wanted to make sure na hindi onerous o disadvantageous to government iyong mga provisions,"" he said. ""On Oct 20, on the day that this was given to me, submitted to me, I signed it already. So there is no such thing as somebody dropping the ball. It is really an ongoing (negotiation).""
[Translation: I wanted to make sure the provisions are not onerous or disadvantageous to the government.]
Meanwhile, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also vouched for the health secretary, echoing the latter’s statement that negotiations are underway.
“There is no bungled deal, because ongoing po ang negotiation,” Galvez told CNN Philippines on Thursday, adding that there was only a delay at most in the process.
Galvez also said the claim that the Philippines could have immediately secured 10 million doses is “impossible,” as Pfizer has only recently been granted emergency use authorization. He further noted that the richest countries have already bought some 80 percent of the Pfizer vaccine.
“Wala po 'yung sinasabi nilang dropping the ball,"" he said. ""Hindi po nangyari ito kasi nasalo po natin eh. Dahil kasi po ang nakita po natin ay talagang nag-iingat po tayo sa mga pinipirmahan po natin.”
[Translation: There was no such thing as dropping the ball. This did not happen, and in fact, we caught the ball. We are being careful in the documents we are signing.]
To date, only the vaccine produced by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech has secured emergency use authorization abroad, including from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Singapore.
The Duterte administration is still banking on Chinese-manufactured vaccine Sinovac to be the first vaccine to reach the Philippines. Roque on Tuesday said Sinovac is the only brand that can provide supply at the earliest time possible, which is in March or April 2021. The government is looking to secure up to 25 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine, even if the Chinese drug maker has not yet disclosed results of its phase 3 clinical trials to prove it is safe and effective.
The country has so far formally secured 2.6 million doses of vaccine from British drug maker AstraZeneca, which are expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021.The deal was closed through a ₱600-million donation from over 30 private companies.

Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of the DOST-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, told CNN Philippines’ News Night on Wednesday that AstraZeneca’s application has been forwarded to the Food and Drug Administration for regulatory approval.
This came after it passed separate evaluations by a panel of vaccine experts and by the ethics review board, which is also composed of vaccine experts, technical experts, and scientists tasked to recommend possible vaccine candidates for the Philippines.
The FDA, meanwhile, has the final say on which firms will be allowed to conduct clinical trials in the country.

Shortly after Montoya made the disclosure, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said he has yet to receive the endorsement from DOST.
AstraZeneca is currently applying to hold Phase 3 of the clinical trials in the country, wherein a vaccine is tested on larger populations in different countries to confirm its efficacy and safety.
The national government, along with the private sector, inked a deal with the UK company last Nov. 27 for 2.6 million doses of the vaccine. This is expected to be rolled out in the Philippines by June 2021 if it passed clinical trials.

According to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., AstraZeneca is offering its vaccine at $10 or almost ₱500 per dose, making it the easiest and cheapest purchase among vaccine candidates. Meanwhile, the downpayment for every dose is only $5 or nearly ₱250.
However, Galvez also previously admitted the risks in signing the agreement amid doubts on AstraZeneca's efficacy. The drugmaker itself had confirmed that its clinical trials were put on hold twice due to concerns about two study participants who became seriously ill.
The country's COVID-19 task force is looking to administer vaccines from different manufacturers to at least 70 million Filipinos. The vaccination program will be carried out for three to five years with 25-30 million Filipinos vaccinated each year.

The process, which is complicated by the need to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine under strict conditions and give each recipient two doses, three weeks apart, will be closely watched from around the world.
Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that 50 hospital hubs across England had already received their allocation of the vaccine, and that the distribution of the vaccine was ""really well underway now.""
UK health officials expect to have up to 4 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, available by the end of December, Cordery said.
The government has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine so far, enough to vaccinate 20 million people, or a third of the UK population. More deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded in the UK than anywhere else in Europe.
The speed with which UK regulators approved the vaccine -- ahead of their counterparts elsewhere in Europe and in the United States -- raised questions in some quarters. But Cordery said the process had been ""incredibly robust.""

""Yes, it has been shorter than other vaccine approval processes, but that's because everything all has been thrown at this all in one go,"" she said.
The head of the UK medicines regulator also put out assurances on Sunday, saying the Pfizer/BioNTech jab is ""as safe as any general vaccine"" and that those receiving it would be monitored by health officials.
""You might have a mild symptom but it will probably disappear in a day or two, and nothing at all of a serious nature,"" June Raine, head of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), told the BBC.
According to the MHRA, more than one in 10 recipients may suffer side effects including pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. A handful of other, less common, side effects are also listed.
Asked about the potential impact of Brexit on the vaccination program, Raine said: ""We've practiced, we are ready and we are fully prepared for any possible outcome.""
The transition period for the UK's exit from the European Union comes to an end on December 31. Last-ditch talks between EU and UK leaders on a trade deal continued over the weekend, amid dire warnings over the economic and logistic chaos that would result from a hard crash out of the world's largest trading bloc.
""Our goal at the HMRA is to make sure that whatever the outcome, whatever the deal, medicines, medical devices, and vaccines reach everyone in all parts of the country in the same way without any interruption at all,"" Raine said.
Logistical challenge
The first doses of the vaccine reportedly arrived in the UK on Thursday night, carried by a fleet of unmarked trucks through the Eurotunnel from Belgium to undisclosed storage facilities in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, according to CNN affiliate ITV News.
The UK government's announcement of its approval a day earlier had been followed by confusion over who would get the vaccine first and how it could be administered safely, given the logistical constraints.
The vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, a temperature only possible in special freezers. Once taken out of the freezer, the MHRA authorization requires the doses to be kept refrigerated and used within 5 days. Batches can only be moved and repacked into smaller numbers of doses a limited number of times and under strict conditions. Once a vial is diluted for injection, it cannot be transported and must be used within six hours, or discarded.
The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended vaccinating residents of care homes for older adults and their staff first, followed by people aged over 80 as well as health and care workers.
But the challenges involved in getting the vaccine to care home residents means health workers now plan to administer it first to people aged over 80 who are about to be discharged from hospital, or are attending out-patient hospital appointments.
""Hospitals will also begin inviting over 80s in for a jab and work with care home providers to book their staff in to vaccination clinics,"" a statement from NHS England said Sunday. ""Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from Covid.""
Raine told the BBC the exact timing might be ""variable"" but that she expected to see the vaccine reach care homes ""definitely within the next two weeks.""
Northern Ireland's Health Ministry said Friday an initial consignment of almost 25,000 doses had arrived, paving the way for ""vaccinations to commence from early next week, starting with vaccinator teams.""
Scotland is set to receive 65,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from the initial batch of 800,000 doses distributed in the UK, Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack said in an op-ed for the Mail on Sunday.
He added that the Armed Forces were involved in the planning and logistics of the vaccination program.
Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said those giving the vaccinations would be the first to receive it, followed by care home residents and staff, then all those 80 years of age and over and front line health and social care workers.
She acknowledged the challenges around transporting the vaccine to care homes and individual residences, but added: ""For all the difficulties that lie ahead, it should give us all real hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight.""
Fauci apology
Other nations are not far behind the UK when it comes to taking a decision on approving the vaccine.
The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee December 10 to discuss Pfizer/BioNTech's emergency authorization application. It will meet again on December 17 to consider the application for Moderna's vaccine candidate.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, apologized Thursday after suggesting a day earlier that UK regulators had not scrutinized the data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as carefully as their US counterparts.
News of the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was welcomed by many Britons as a ray of light at the end of a dark year.
There are hopes that UK approval could soon follow for Moderna and the vaccine candidate developed by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca and Oxford University.
But the four chief medical officers for the United Kingdom warned in a letter that this winter would still be ""especially hard"" and that people must not let down their guard against the virus.
""Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months,"" they said.
Russia starts mass vaccination
Meanwhile, vaccination centers across Moscow started to distribute Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, initially to groups such as teachers, health professionals, and municipal services workers.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered large-scale vaccination with Sputnik V to begin across the country from this week.
Russia became the first country in the world to approve its coronavirus vaccine in August, authorizing the treatment for public use even before crucial Phase 3 trials -- which are still underway -- were conducted. The move drew criticism from scientific circles.
""Civil vaccination has started at 70 points in Moscow today. We work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week,"" Natalya Nikolaevna Kuzenkova, chief doctor of Moscow's Hospital 68, told CNN on Saturday.
Kuzenkova shrugged off questions about vaccine safety. ""If there is a question between getting sick or getting a vaccine ... this is a very dangerous disease which leads to quite serious consequences. So the answer is obvious here,"" she said.
""The vaccine has officially been registered. Two stages of clinical trials have passed and we are now completing the third stage. Therefore, within the framework of a pandemic, in these conditions, this does not at all contradict any regulatory norms,"" she added.
Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin suggested early participation was enthusiastic, saying more than 5,000 people had registered for vaccination in the first five hours.
One of those getting vaccinated Saturday told CNN she was ""not at this point"" afraid of having the vaccine before trials are over.
""Well, of course there are some concerns. But I try not to think about it,"" said the woman, who works as an administrator at the hospital and identified herself only as Nadezhda. ""I wanted to get immunity from the new Covid-19 infection. Protect myself and my family. In order not to get sick, not to get complications, not to infect my loved ones.""
Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said last week that more than 100,000 Russian citizens had already had the Sputnik V vaccine.
Officials say there are enough doses for more than 2 million people across Russia, which has a population of about 145 million.

The company said it had delivered the data from its late-stage trial to the WHO.
An emergency use listing would make the vaccine available in more than 190 countries, including multiple developing countries. If authorized, it would also allow J&J to supply the COVAX program – a global distribution and procurement agency that is helping manage COVID-19 vaccines for 190 participating countries.
In December, J&J came to an agreement with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, that is backing the COVAX program. If authorized, J&J expects to provide up to 500 million doses to COVAX through next year, the company said.

“Our filing with the World Health Organization marks another important step in our effort to combat COVID-19 and also in our unwavering commitment to equitable access,” Dr. Paul Stoffels, Johnson & Johnson’s vice chair of the executive committee and chief scientific officer, said in a news release. ""If we are to end the global pandemic, life-saving innovations like vaccines must be within reach for all countries.”
J&J filed for a conditional marketing authorization application in the European Union on Monday.
Next Friday, the US Food and Drug Administration will consider the data the company submitted for an emergency use authorization of the vaccine in the United States. J&J has promised to deliver 100 million doses of its single-dose vaccine to the US by the end of June.
The COVID-19 vaccine’s efficacy against moderate and severe disease ranged from one country to another:
- 72% in the US
- 66% in Latin America
- 57% in South Africa
It was 66% effective globally. This was measured starting one month after the shot. The vaccine is 85% effective overall at preventing hospitalization and 100% at preventing death in all regions where it was tested.

http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2020/11/21/pfizer-biontech-submit-fda-emergency-authorization-covid-vaccine.html,Pfizer and BioNTech to submit to FDA today for emergency authorization for their coronavirus vaccine,Jamie Gumbrecht,"Nov 21, 2020 1:00:21 AM","(CNN) -- Pfizer and BioNTech said they will submit to the US Food and Drug Administration today for an emergency use authorization for their coronavirus vaccine candidate.
This is the first coronavirus vaccine to seek a regulatory OK in the United States.
The companies said in a statement that their vaccine candidate, known as BNT162b2, will potentially be available for use in high-risk populations in the United States by the middle to end of December. The vaccine requires two doses a few weeks apart, and protection is achieved 28 days after the first shot.
The submission to the FDA is based on results from the Phase 3 clinical trial of Pfizer's vaccine, which began in the United States on July 27 and enrolled more than 43,000 volunteers.
ADVERTISEMENT
The final analysis from the trial found the coronavirus vaccine was 95% effective in preventing infections, even in older adults, and caused no serious safety concerns, Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, announced this week. The submission also includes safety data on about 100 children ages 12 to 15.
About 42% of global participants and 30% of US participants in the Phase 3 study have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds, the companies said in a news release, and 41% of global and 45% of US participants are ages 56 to 85.
""Filing in the U.S. represents a critical milestone in our journey to deliver a COVID-19 vaccine to the world and we now have a more complete picture of both the efficacy and safety profile of our vaccine, giving us confidence in its potential,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said in a statement.
Moderna, another pharmaceutical company, announced Monday that early clinical trial results show its vaccine is 94.5% effective. The company plans to apply to the FDA for authorization after it accumulates more safety data later this month.
Emergency use authorization, or EUA, from the FDA is not the same as full approval. An EUA allows products to be used under particular circumstances before all the evidence is available for approval. For an EUA, the agency says it will determine whether a product's ""known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks.""
What happens after an EUA
The FDA has scheduled a meeting of its Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, a group of outside experts, for December 8, 9 and 10, a source familiar with the process told CNN this week. The agency could make a decision at the end of the meeting on December 10 about whether to issue an emergency use authorization, the source said.
""It will make sense that in all likelihood the FDA will consider both applications together,"" the source said, considering that both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use the same technology and appear to have very similar safety and efficacy results from their large-scale clinical trials.
If the FDA authorizes the vaccines, they can then be immediately distributed to states, according to a presentation made last month at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
However, no one can be vaccinated until a CDC advisory committee reviews the data, recommends the vaccine, and decides which groups will receive it first.
If the FDA authorizes the vaccines, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, an independent panel of experts, will meet within 24 to 48 hours, according to a CDC spokesperson.
At that meeting, the committee will determine if everyone should get the vaccine, or if some people should be excluded.
""We have all been alerted on ACIP we should be very flexible with our calendars because it's likely there won't be a lot of advanced notice given for this meeting. It will be done very, very quickly,"" Dr. William Schaffner, a committee member, told CNN this week.
Once ACIP issues its recommendations, vaccinations can be given.
""We have a plan in places that the moment that the FDA concludes that that vaccine is safe and effective, we have a system in place to begin within 24 hours to ship that to hospitals and health care officials and 24 hours after that injecting that vaccine into Americans,"" Vice President Mike Pence said during a White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing on Thursday.
States are currently working out the details of running vaccination clinics. The Pfizer vaccine is particularly complicated, since it must be stored at minus 75 degrees Celsius, and doctors' offices and pharmacies typically do not have freezers that go that low.
The first groups expected to receive the vaccine are health care workers, the elderly, essential works such as police officers, and those with underlying medical conditions.

But he acknowledged it will remain a difficult journey.
Moderna hours before had announced its Covid-19 vaccine has an astonishingly high success rate -- 94.5% effective -- based on interim clinical trial data. It is the second company to report such high efficacy results.

That tunnel is going to be a long one.

Most Americans probably won't get vaccinated until next year. And the fall surge continues to bring a terrifying jump in cases across the US: For the 11th day in a row, Illinois reported more than 10,000 cases in a single day, according to the state Department of Health website. Nationwide, for two straight weeks, the US has added more than 100,000 new cases daily.
Cases in California are up 51.3% in the past week and daily cases have doubled in just 10 days, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. About 70% of the counties in the state are moving back into more restrictive tiers as Newsom used the analogy of ""pulling an emergency brake"" to deal with the crisis.
As vaccination trials continue, tens of thousands of lives could either be saved or lost, depending on how people act. Traditional Thanksgiving gatherings, for example, are a huge concern among health experts and state leaders.
""We simply can't do that right now,"" Walz said as his state reported 24,000 new cases in just three days.
All of this comes as one expert says Covid-19 could become the leading daily cause of death in the US.
""It's more than just heading in the wrong direction,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. ""We are on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.""
Why the 'war' against Covid-19 is getting worse
Much of the current surge is fueled by people hanging out with friends or family who don't live with them -- and wrongfully assuming they're not infected.
US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said all Americans must mask up and double down on safety precautions, including social distancing, as the next few months are expected to be the worst of the pandemic.
""Hard truths: 49/50 states with increasing cases, 34 in red or orange zones (ie significant rise),"" Adams tweeted.
""Record cases over the past week will be record hospitalizations soon. Our/ YOUR communities and hospitals simply can not sustain high level care at this rate of increase.""
Many hospitals are already running out of health care staff. Major surgeries for non-Covid patients are getting delayed. And some patients are several hours away from the closest available ICU bed.
Nationwide, more than 11 million people in the US have been infected with coronavirus, and more than 247,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
If 95% of Americans wore masks consistently, 68,000 lives could be saved by March 1, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
If not, the death toll is expected to reach 439,000 by March 1.
The hospitalization record is shattered, again
A record-high 69,864 Covid-19 patients were hospitalized Sunday, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
That number far exceeds the spring peak of 59,940, on April 15, and the summer peak of 59,718 on July 23.
Hospitalizations will likely keep rising as new infections keep soaring. And the increased case numbers aren't just due to more testing.
The US has averaged 148,725 new Covid-19 cases per day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins. That's a 31% increase in new cases from the previous week.
But the number of new Covid-19 tests performed has increased only 10.42%, according to the Covid Tracking Project.
Bipartisan officials enact new restrictions
A growing number of Republican and Democratic governors and city leaders have issued new mandates to try to stop the crisis from getting worse.
On Monday, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio announced new limits on social gatherings, weddings and funerals.
""Despite the health order that limited mass gatherings to 10 people that was signed in April remaining in effect, we have seen rampant spread of the virus as a result of banquets, wedding receptions, and social gatherings following funerals,"" the governor said.
""We have seen great tragedy associated with such events. It's not the ceremonies causing the problem. It's the party afterward.""
The revised order prohibits dancing or socializing in open, congregate areas. Guests must be seated, and food should be served to them at their seats. No more than 10 people can sit at a table, and those people must be from the same household.
Philadelphia announced new outdoor restrictions. As a result, the Eagles will not be able to host fans at Lincoln Financial Field, the NFL team said in a tweet.
Starting Thursday, all bars and restaurants in Oklahoma must close by 11 p.m. and restaurant tables must be 6 feet apart.
""We need to slow the spread of this virus,"" said Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. ""Data shows that social distancing is harder to maintain as it gets later at night, especially in bars.""
Beginning Tuesday, state employees must wear masks in common areas or when they are close to other workers, Stitt said.
Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has banned indoor social gatherings with people from different households, unless they take appropriate precautions.
Those precautions include everyone quarantining for 14 days before the gathering, or quarantining for seven days before the gathering and getting a negative Covid-19 test result no more than 48 hours beforehand.
Outdoor gatherings will be limited to five people in Washington state, and restaurants and bars will be limited to outdoor service with capacity limits and to-go service. Stores, including grocery stores, are limited to 25% capacity.
In Michigan, high schools and colleges will shift to remote learning for three weeks. Indoor restaurant dining has been suspended.
In Oregon, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown announced a two-week ""social freeze,"" which includes limiting social gatherings, suspending indoor restaurant dining, and limiting the number of people who can gather for faith-based organizations.
And Republican Govs. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Gary Herbert of Utah are among the latest to mandate face masks across their states.
""Right now, the data demands a higher level of mitigation efforts to reverse this dangerous trends, to slow the spread of the virus, and to avoid the need for any economic shutdowns,"" Burgum said.
Former FDA heads under Trump and Bush call for mask mandates
Health experts have lamented the lack of a strong, coordinated federal response to this pandemic. So it's ""now up to governors"" to enact tough restrictions to get Covid-19 outbreaks under control, two former commissioners of the Food and Drug Administration wrote.
""At least while infections are widespread and surging, governors and local leaders should mandate the use of masks and impose clear and consistent plans to restrict gatherings,"" Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Mark McClellan wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.
""Americans are understandably tired of Covid, but accepting temporary restrictions now will help prevent even more painful personal and economic disruptions.""
Gottlieb worked in the Trump administration, and McClellan worked in the George W. Bush administration.
Many governors have taken aggressive steps to slow the spread,"" they wrote, ""but states that don't act quickly put the entire nation at risk.""
'This winter will be hard'
Yes, there's great news with two vaccine trials -- one from Moderna, and one from Pfizer/BioNTech.
But let's be clear: There will be no return to normal this year, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said.
""This winter will be hard. We will not have a big impact on the infection numbers with our vaccine this winter,"" Sahin told the BBC.
Last week, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said ""we believe that we are in good situation to have up to 50 million doses this year, globally, and I believe we are in a very, very good situation to have 1.3 billion doses globally next year.""
But just like the Moderna vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses for each person.
So if 50 million doses are available worldwide by the end of this year, that would mean 25 million people could get vaccinated.
Moderna, Pfizer and other companies making vaccines must first ask for and then receive emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration before they can start distributing their vaccines.

MANILA - San Miguel Corp said Tuesday it is spending almost P1 billion to vaccinate all of its 70,000 employees against COVID-19 for free.
The company said it has secured COVID-19 vaccines from various sources and is currently preparing employees for vaccination with its “Ligtas Lahat” task force, in coordination with the government.
Receiving the vaccines is voluntary, but SMC President Ramon Ang said he hopes that all of their eligible employees will sign up for vaccination.
“Our program...aims to create a safe and healthy workplace so that we can further contribute to our country’s economic recovery,” Ang, said.
The government is allowing the private sector to procure its own vaccines against COVID-19. Procurement of vaccines will be free from taxes and duties until Dec. 31, 2023.

MANILA — The Zuellig Pharma Corporation on Tuesday said that it was increasing its cold chain capacity to handle more coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines for the country.
“We have ordered 10 additional ultra-low freezers, on top of the 14 already deployed through our network in anticipation of the storage and distribution demands of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines,” said Jannette Jakosalem, Zuellig's chief business officer.
Government officials earlier inspected cold chain facilities to be used to store COVID-19 vaccines, including those from Zuellig.
Distribution of vaccines around the country depends on the cold storage capacity for various COVID-19 vaccines with different temperature requirements.

Zuellig Pharma's chief executive and area director Maikel Kuijpers said the company would continue to work with the government to address the COVID-19 crisis.
“Zuellig Pharma has played an active role during the pandemic by undertaking urgent deliveries of influenza (flu) vaccines as well as conducting mass flu vaccination exercises. We are honored and excited to engage with the Philippine government to explore ways in which we can support measures to address this current crisis and help execute the national COVID-19 vaccination program,” Kuijpers said.
“Over our long history of supplying health care products during crises such as world wars, economic crises or natural disasters, we have learned best practices that we believe are applicable to the current COVID-19 pandemic, which I hope we can share,” he added.
The company's nationwide cold rooms, with temperatures of 2° to 8° Celsius, are located across various warehouses in Santa Rosa, Laguna, Sun Valley in Parañaque, Cebu and Davao, and can store up to 629 million vaccine doses, it said.
It also has walk-in freezers that can store up to 52 million doses at -15° to -25° Celsius. They are also increasing its ultra-cold freezer capacity to 24 freezers that can store over 7 million doses at temperatures of as low as -70° to -80° Celsius, and can further ramp up this capacity if needed.
Kuijpers noted about its COVID-19 digital care platform, eZVax, developed in partnership with Accenture and Microsoft, could serve as a centralized hub coordinating and linking both stakeholders and processes through the whole mass vaccination program.
""eZVax allows checking of eligibility, pre-screening, and scheduling of vaccination of patients including date, time, and location. It has administration support with recording of patient and vaccine details, scheduling of second dose when necessary, and generation of digital health passport or vaccination card. The platform will also generate centralised adverse event reporting,"" he said.
“Our system features powerful data and analytics tools that allow us to drive efficiencies through the process whilst providing real-time dashboards and status reports.”
Delivering an eventual COVID-19 vaccine to billions of people around the world will require a Herculean effort, according to industry insiders, with the biggest challenge posed by the need for cold storage and transport.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/blogs/business/12/14/20/covid-19-is-not-going-away-even-with-a-vaccine,COVID-19 is not going away,Aneth Ng-Lim,Dec 14 2020 10:12 AM,"News of successful COVID-19 vaccine trials came one after another, and with the governments around the world now releasing their stamps of approval, it seems we have finally turned a corner in this global pandemic.
I can’t help but wonder if this is why nearly all the shopping malls are attracting huge crowds these days. Could the optimism from these developments embolden the Filipinos to leave their homes and resume their pre-pandemic lives?
I was initially blaming the 12.12 sale but the truth is even before this red-letter date, social media chat groups were reporting shoppers failing to observe physical distancing. When you see the number of people packed in confined spaces, I can understand why social distancing is not followed. But aren’t we still under community quarantine with crowd control protocols to ensure physical distancing is always possible?
If you are one of those eager to line up for the vaccine as soon as it reaches Philippine shores, please consider what medical experts are also saying.
The Washington Post (WP) spoke to experts in epidemiology, disaster planning and vaccine development and they all say that even after vaccines are deployed, COVID-19 will likely remain for decades to come. “Experts call such diseases endemic — stubbornly resisting efforts to stamp them out. Think measles, HIV, chickenpox,” says the WP report featured in its dedicated section for Coronavirus coverage.
Things are not going to get better overnight, but in the long haul, the situation should improve. This will need several things to happen such as more people getting infected, people’s bodies adapting to the virus, and immunity to COVID-19 spreading by natural means and medical intervention.
Sarah Cobey, an epidemiologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, who was interviewed in the same WP report raised a key question that should all be top of our mind: “This virus is here to stay. The question is, how do we live with it safely?”
Here are 10 things you can do to protect yourself, your loved ones living with you, and to arrest the spread of the virus (and still squeeze in some holiday shopping and pre-COVID 19 life activities):
#1 Wear a mask.Yes, it’s uncomfortable. Breathing is constricted. And if you have to wear it all day at work, you can feel suffocated. But I recommend reading stories of patients who were infected with COVID-19, or watching YouTube videos of the same topic and that should make you realize wearing a mask is a small price to pay to keep breathing.
#2 Add on a face shield.
Wearing a face shield on top of a face mask is just like the two-factor authentication now required by banks if you want to access your account. You need your log-in password plus a one-time PIN. It can be a hassle but it keeps your money safe from fraudsters.
Face masks can get dislodged or maybe you want a few seconds break from wearing it. The face shield can keep you safe if these happen. And even if they don’t, covering your eyes and mouth – two confirmed entry points for the virus – is always the safest for you.
#3 Avoid contact as much as you can.
Crossing the street? Avoid pressing the crosswalk button and just wait for the traffic signal to change. Entering stores? Wait for the guard to open the doors or pick entry points with automated doors. Going down the escalator? Try to keep your balance without holding on to the rails.#4 No to confined spaces.
Good air circulation will help ensure you don’t get infected and this is something lacking in confined spaces. If you are just going up one to two to three floors, better to take the stairs than be stuck inside an elevator box. Waiting for an appointment and the lobby area is small? Offer to wait outside and have them call you when they are ready for you.
#5 Always carry sanitizers.
A small spray bottle of sanitizer or alcohol can help you keep your sanity if you do end up in contact with a public door handle, use a public bathroom, or must ride an elevator to go up 15 floors. ATM machines are another red flag but we all need cash so be ready to spray away. Or you can always ask the bank personnel to sanitize for you before use.
#6 Keep it under 30 minutes.
With so few interactions with family and friends, when we do see them, we get so excited that time flies by. But the medical recommendation is to limit physical meetings to 30 minutes or less. This holds true for work meetings, and personal errands as well. Anything that requires you to stay longer than this is a warning sign that you are endangering yourself, and everyone around you.
#7 Keep your 1-meter distance, or more if you can.
Some places have distancing guidelines that are helpful to know where you should stay and where the others around you should stand. But not all areas have the same floor stickers or markings so try to measure at home what your 1 meter is like and remember it visually. It’s usually more than an arm’s length so when you can see someone crossing that line you know you have to step back.
#8 Discover digital payments.
If you haven’t discovered it yet, it’s time to switch to digital banking and digital payments. Paper bills and coins can cause the virus to spread faster as these change hands many times in a day. Choose a digital partner based on your bank of account so the onboarding will be easier for you. Always check the fees – I’ve been using digital banking for some time now and have avoided paying cash in and cash out fees. The trick is to choose the right channels to cash in and cash in (some outlets are free, and some are not) and to do it in the right amounts.
#9 Shop online.
12.12 sales proved to me again that shopping online can be a smarter move for your wallet. For the same brand, I learned that their physical stores did not offer the sales available in their online shop – and that’s a 20% discount! Many offer free shipping too so you save on transportation, plus the cost of your disposable face mask by staying home and letting your fingers do the buying.
#10 Organize virtual get-togethers.
Nine out of 10, people say they leave their homes because they need to see other people and mingle with humanity. Why not try virtual get-togethers for now? Chances are you are not the only one missing your family and friends and your invitation will be welcomed.The WP report pointed out that “living long-term with the virus also means addressing the mental health effects.” Depression and anxiety are problems facing not only medical front liners, but also teachers, students, and all sectors badly hit by the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown. “The psychological recovery is going to be as important as economic and logistical parts of this.”

Filipinos who had a layover in the 21 areas on which Manila imposed travel restrictions will be allowed to enter the Philippines but will also have to undergo quarantine, Sandoval said.
""Kung galing lang po sila doon sa 21 countries at nag-layover po, meaning di po sila lumabas ng airport, hindi sila cleared ng immigration dun at merely nag-transit po, pwede na po sila papasukin ng bansa.

MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte said national recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is ""within sight"" as the Philippines secures vaccine jabs against the respiratory disease that has led to nearly a year-long lockdown and economic recession.
Duterte said this in a taped message as local government units and private firms helped lock in 17 million doses so far of the COVID-19 vaccine from British drugs group AstraZeneca.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel. National recovery is within sight. As we bounce back and heal as one, I commend the business community and the LGUs for your ramping of support for our nation’s fight against COVID-19,"" the President said.

""We now have the weapon to defeat this virus – the vaccine. And let us win the war and save lives and livelihood,"" he said.
The Philippines has also secured 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech, and 30 million doses from the Serum Institute of India.
The country might also receive an initial vaccine batch from SU-based Pfizer and Russia's Gamaleya Institute in February, said Malacañang.

MANILA (UPDATE2) — The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday granted British company AstraZeneca emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine, 3 weeks after its application.
“After a thorough review of the currently available data by our medical and regulatory experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
EFFICACY RATE
This makes AstraZeneca’s vaccine the 2nd, after Pfizer's, to be approved for emergency use in the Philippines where 518,407 coronavirus infections have so far been confirmed.
READ: PH logs 2,245 new COVID-19 cases, highest since November; addt’l deaths at 95
“The vaccine regimen consists of 2 equal standard doses of .5mL, each given 4 to 12 weeks apart,” Domingo said.
He said the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 70% after the first dose, and trials are ongoing to determine the efficacy rate after the 2nd dose.

AstraZeneca previously caused confusion after it announced that a lower dosing regimen, involving use of half only of the first dose, resulted in higher efficacy.
But Domingo explained that the company found out that “the longer interval between the 2 doses was deemed responsible for the higher immunogenicity in the group that was given the lower 1st dose.”
This is why the Philippines will be following the standard regimen of 2 full doses given 4 to 12 weeks apart, he said.
While it is only 70% effective in preventing COVID, Domingo said those who took part in the trial only had mild to moderate symptoms of the disease.
“Yung data naman ng AstraZeneca shows that it is very good in preventing severe COVID-19. Halos 100% din. Kaya lang, siyempre, medyo maliit pa ang datos nila at maa-update pa yan as we get more data on the people included in the clinical trial,” he said.
(The data of AstraZeneca shows that it is very good in preventing severe COVID-19 - almost 100%. However, their data is still not sizable and it will get updated as we get more data on the people included in the clinical trial.)

STORAGE
While the initial rate is lower than the efficacy rate of vaccine frontrunners Pfizer and Moderna, which have rates of around 95%, AstraZeneca seems to be more favored by local government units in the Philippines because of its storage requirements.

Unlike those requiring ultra cold freezers, AstraZeneca’s vaccine can be kept in regular refrigerator temperatures as with more common vaccines kept by the Department of Health.
“The advantage of this vaccine is that it is stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees. Hindi sya masyadong maselan, at madali syang ma-transport at i-store sa lugar ng pagbabakunahan,” Domingo said.
(The advantage of this vaccine is that it is stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees. It is not that sensitive, and it can easily be transported and stored at the vaccination site.)
SIDE EFFECTS
Domingo said there are also no special precautions specific for AstraZeneca’s vaccine, although that may change as more countries use it.
“Ang nakitang adverse effects niya are all very mild, very similar to getting any flu injection na karamihan ay pananakit sa lugar ng injection, konting sinat, konting sakit ng ulo that are all transient and easily managed,” he said.
(The adverse effects seen for this vaccine are all very mild, very similar to getting any flu injection - soreness in the injection site, slight fever, headache that are all transient and easily managed.)
Up to 39 local government units have signed a tripartite agreement with the national government and the private sector to secure 17 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine.
“This is great news! We are very happy to hear this and we look forward to the arrival of our order from them,” Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto said of the FDA's approval, in a text message to ABS-CBN News.
Pasig City is the first local government unit in the country to gain the national government’s approval on vaccination plan. The city is also among the Health Department’s chosen site for the vaccine simulation.
But there is no definite date yet as to when vaccines are expected to arrive in the city.
“I’m sure they will get it here as soon as possible, all factors considered,” Sotto said.
In a separate statement, San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora said the ""FDA’s approval is a validation that purchasing from AstraZeneca is the right decision"".
“An EUA from the FDA assures us that the vaccine has been well studied and reviewed by experts, and is safe for public use,” he said.
Zamora assured the LGU continues to prepare and fine tune the vaccination process as the city looks forward to the delivery of the vaccines.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said Wednesday he is expecting 200,000 to 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine among the estimated 1 million vaccine doses the country will get next month.

AstraZeneca is one of the few vaccine developers that have received EUAs from stringent regulatory authorities (SRA) recognized by the World Health Organization, allowing its application to be expedited by the FDA.
The FDA had said those with approval from SRAs, like Pfizer's, can be approved within 21 days from application.
The remaining 3 companies awaiting FDA's EUA approval for their vaccine candidates are Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, China’s Sinovac, and India's Bharat Biotech.
The Philippines aims to inoculate up to 70 million people to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus.

MANILA (UPDATE 2) - Three to 5 years to roll out the vaccine against COVID-19 is ""too long"" and will be ""too late"" for the Philippine economy to recover, Sen. Ralph Recto said on Tuesday as the Senate prepares to press the executive branch for its inoculation plan.
Vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr. said last month vaccinating 60 to 70 million Filipinos will be done over a ""3 to 5-year period.""
Malacañang also revealed the vaccine distribution will be done with a geographical and sectoral strategy, with priority given to COVID-19 hotspots, such as Metro Manila, Davao City and Bacolod City.
COVID-19 vaccination may take up to 5 years, 35M Pinoys on priority list: official
Government needs to address first the pandemic to bring back consumer and businesses' confidence to revive the economy, Recto said.
""We heard them also say 3-5 years. That’s too long. I don’t think it should take 5 years. I think our plan should be 2 years for the whole country. It will be hard to survive 3 to 5 years, that’s too long,"" he told ANC's Headstart.
""Saying that we will be able to vaccinate on 3-5 years does not provide confidence. Maraming missed opportunities, sayang. If we can show the public, ‘tingnan niyo 'yung healthcare workers natin binabayaran natin nang tama'...Say that 'we will vaccinate all of you, walang pilitan,' that will provide confidence.""
(There are many missed opportunities. If we can show the public, 'Our healthcare workers are being paid correctly'...Say that 'we will vaccinate all of you, we won't force you,' that will provide confidence.)
If government inoculates its citizens within 2 years, the Philippines will recover ""only the loss of P1.950 billion in the second half of 2022,"" he added.
""S'yempre takot ang consumer, worker, businessman to invest. In this scenario only government can make the investment, that’s why I’m saying the budget should be bigger and there’s a need to extend Bayanihan 2, the GAA (General Appropriations Act of 2020), maybe even a Bayanihan 3,"" he said.
(Of course consumers, workers, and businessmen are scared to invest.)
Recto said the Senate may resume session during the holidays to ""discuss with the executive the game plan.""
""(We want them to) tell Congress so we can approve the money necessary for it and we can help them in explaining that to the public,"" he said.
""We now are watching globally the vaccine rollout... Clearly, there is light at the end of the tunnel but that tunnel is still long so you still have to practice social distancing, handwashing, so on and so forth.""
Recto said among the questions lawmakers will want to tackle are: ""Which vaccines are we purchasing? Why are we purchasing them? What will be the quantity? When will be the delivery? What will be the manner of distributing this nationwide?""
The Philippines can also buy vaccines from other countries that ordered in excess of their population to address the depleting supply of the inoculation, the senator added.
""There are many countries who ordered vaccines more than their population, we can talk to them, pay them back.""
In the proposed budget submitted by Congress to President Rodrigo Duterte, some P2.5 billion is earmarked for the vaccination program under the Department of Health's budget. Another P70 billion in standby funds will be added from either approved loans or once the government exceeds its non-tax revenues targets. The stimulus plan Bayanihan 2 puts another P10 billion to the vaccine budget.
Recto is seeking a third Bayanihan Act to further stimulate the economy and support the vaccination plan to possibly include the whole Philippine population.
""Provide for 100 percent of the population without even mandating it, but it’s available. Kung gusto nila, pwede silang magpabakuna. That’s how it should work. Hindi yung 60 percent lang, 70 percent lang. Nagtitipid tayo,"" he said.
(Provide for 100 percent of the population without even mandating it, but it's available. If they want, they can get themselves vaccinated. That's how it should work. Not just inoculating 60 percent, 70 percent. We're being too thrifty.)
""Let’s get the best vaccine available. The most effective, the safest. Let’s not say na 'Ito mas mura 'to. Mababa effectiveness nito, safety nito pero mas mura 'to. Ito ang kunin natin.’ Let’s give the people the best available in the market,"" he added.
(Let's get the best vaccine available. The most effective, the safest. Let's not say, 'This is cheaper. It's less effective, less safe, but it's cheaper. Let's get this.' Let's give the people the best available in the market.)
The vaccines would be a small price to pay if it would help stimulate the economy, which shrunk this year, said Recto.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines may start inoculating COVID-19 vaccines to the public by May next year if everything will go according to plan, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr, who was recently tapped to lead the importation and distribution program, said Thursday.
DOH: Galvez to expedite procurement, rollout of COVID-19 vaccine
Why is COVID-19 vaccine czar an ex-general? 'Managerial skills' needed, says Palace
The government is looking to place an advance procurement of about 24 million vaccines within the first quarter of next year, said Galvez. The initial batch of vaccines will be for frontliners, indigents, and the vulnerable sectors, he said.
The inoculation rollout will largely depend on the financing, development and approval of the vaccines, he said.
""If everything will go well, ang mangyayari po is earliest is May,"" he told ANC's Headstart when asked about the vaccination timeline.
Should there be roadblocks on supply and demand, the earliest that the program may begin is by the end of 2021, he said.

""Ang vaccine roadmap po natin is 3 to 5 years. Posible din that you will look at the demand and supply ng vaccine. Before end of 2020, ang presentation sa atin ng World Bank, more or less, 1.4 billion lang ang mapo-produce ng vaccines,"" he said.
(Our vaccine roadmap spans 3 to 5 years. It's also possible to look at the demand and supply of the vaccine. The World Bank presentation indicates that before the end of 2020, only 1.4 billion vaccines will be produced.)
""Sa ngayon, so far, ang demand ng big countries ay more than that. Talagang magkakahirapan tayo sa demand and supply kaya we’re appealing to the WHO (World Health Organization) na bigyan ng equitable access,"" he added.
(The demand from big countries is more than that, so far. We will really have a hard time, that's why we're appealing to the WHO to ensure equitable access.)
The country has a ""standby fund,"" which will enable the procurement ""over and above"" what could be allocated in next year's budget as approved by Congress, said Galvez.
The Department of Health on Wednesday reported 987 additional COVID-19 cases, the lowest recorded daily tally in almost 4 months. This brings the country’s total confirmed cases to 388,137.

MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippines' chef de mission to the upcoming Tokyo Olympics is ready to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to reassure athletes about its safety.
This, even though vaccination is not mandatory for athletes and other delegates bound for the Tokyo Games in July.
""Hindi naman mandatory, but it is advised by the IOC (International Olympic Committee) na kung puwede, magpa-vaccinate 'yung mga athletes,"" said Mariano ""Nonong"" Araneta, the country's chef-de-mission to the Games, in an appearance on ""The Chasedown"" last Saturday.
""Dito naman sa atin, we're trying our best na … magkaroon ng vaccines ang athletes,"" he added. ""Hopefully by May, magkakaroon na tayo ng vaccine.""
However, confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines remains an issue. On Sunday, the Department of Interior and Local Government reported that only three out of 10 individuals in Metro Manila are willing to be vaccinated.
At least one athlete who is hopeful of qualifying to the Tokyo Olympics has also expressed their misgivings about the COVID-19 vaccine, citing potential side effects.
Araneta is ready to get vaccinated, however, in order to boost the athletes' confidence in the process.
""Siyempre ako, magpa-vaccine ako para makita nila,"" he said.
Araneta, also the president of the Philippine Football Federation (PFF), further revealed that they have placed an order of the COVID-19 vaccine for football players and officials.
Philippine sports officials have pushed for athletes -- particularly those who are going to the Olympics and Olympic qualifying tournaments -- to be vaccinated.
Deputy speaker Mikee Romero, also the owner of the NorthPort franchise in the PBA, has filed a resolution that will give elite Filipino athletes priority in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.Meanwhile, Philippine Olympic Committee president Rep. Abraham ""Bambol"" Tolentino announced recently that business tycoon Enrique Razon, chairman of the International Container Terminal Services, Inc., has agreed to provide the country's Olympic-bound athletes and coaches with the COVID-19 vaccine.

Over 80 other Filipino athletes are still seeking qualification, including weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, golfers Yuka Saso and Bianca Pagdanganan, boxer Nesthy Petecio, skateboarder Margielyn Didal, and judoka Kiyomi Watanabe.

MANILA — The Philippines’ total COVID-19 cases jumped to 427,797 on Saturday after the Department of Health (DOH) reported 1,893 new cases, a day after the country, with the help of private companies, inked the first vaccine deal to address the pandemic.
This is the 19th straight day that the daily tally did not exceed 2,000, but it does not include data from 11 laboratories that failed to submit results to the COVID-19 Data Repository System on Friday.
Davao City led areas in the country with the most number of new infections after logging 200 additional cases, followed by Negros Occidental with 123, Samar (Western Samar) with 84, province of Pampanga with 60, and Quezon City with 57.
Davao City has been among the areas being monitored by the government due to the continued rise in COVID-19 cases and high hospital occupancy.
The number of recovered patients increased to 388,062 as the DOH logged 474 more recoveries. The total recoveries account for 90.7 percent of the total recorded cases.
The virus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has claimed 79 more lives. The death toll stood at 8,333.
A total of 31,402 or 7.3 percent of the total number of cases are considered active infections. The health department said 93 percent of patients currently ill are asymptomatic or exhibiting mild symptoms, while 4.4 percent are critically ill.
Of the 27,748 people who were tested as of Friday noon, 1,553 or 5.6 percent were confirmed positive for the disease, data showed.
A total of 14 duplicates were removed from the total tally, said the DOH. Of these, 10 were tagged as recovered cases while 1 death was removed.
A total of 18 cases initially tagged as recoveries were also found to be deaths after validation.

MANILA — The Philippines has started its vaccination program with jabs from Beijing-based drug maker Sinovac Biotech on Monday, in hopes of an immediate return to normalcy as the country races to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).This year, the country aims to inoculate 70 million of its 108 million people to achieve herd immunity and reopen an economy that in 2020 saw its worst contraction on record, due largely to tight restrictions on movement in place since mid-March.

From the manufacturers’ factories overseas, the vaccines will be kept in dry ice coolers or freezers while being transported to their destination countries. From the airport, the cargo must then be cleared by the Bureau of Customs before they are brought to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM).
From the RITM, the vaccines will then be moved to regional warehouses and from there, they will again be to transported to local government units (LGUs).It will then be the responsibility of the LGUs to allocate the vaccines to hospitals and vaccination sites where the vaccines will be administered.

FDA: Efficacy ng Sinovac, bumababa sa health workers na mas exposed sa COVID-19
This prompted the DOH to consult the NITAG for its recommendation on how to distribute the vaccine given its lower efficacy among health workers and the current prioritization framework of the government.
“The DOH, the Food and Drug Administration and our panel of experts concurred that current available evidence is enough to establish that the vaccine is safe for use,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a briefing on Friday with members of the NITAG and the DOH Technical Advisory Group (TAG).
“NITAG and the TAG (technical advisory group) has deemed it sufficient to recommend the use of the vaccine for health care workers as it bears to reiterate that our goal for prioritizing health care workers for vaccination is to reduce morbidity and mortality among their group, while they maintain the most critical essential health services,” she added.
Vergeire said the NITAG already presented the recommendation to the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19 response.
“Just this morning we presented to the IATF and we got approval already. This will also be presented to the President,” she said.This approval “is an assurance that the use of Sinovac is safe and beneficial to our healthcare workers,” said Palace spokesman Harry Roque.“As we have said in many occasions, healthcare workers are the most critical frontliners in our fight against COVID-19 and they remain at the top of our priority list for vaccination,” Roque said in a statement.“We are confident that many of our healthcare workers would get themselves inoculated to boost public confidence in our mass vaccination program against the coronavirus,” he added.Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine will be the first to be rolled out in the Philippines. First in line are health workers in COVID-dedicated hospitals. Vergeire said they are still finalizing which hospitals will receive the jabs.
ALLOWED TO WAIT
The DOH and its advisory groups said that health workers may decline or choose to wait for another vaccine. It won’t affect their priority status.
However, Dr. Nina Castillo-Carandang said the health workers’ readiness to accept COVID-19 vaccines is expected to affect vaccine confidence among the general public.
“If health care workers are reluctant to accept vaccination then that also sends a signal to the general public. We'd like to offer this opportunity for health care workers, if they're willing to do so to have themselves vaccinated with Sinovac,” she said.
Castillo-Carandang said that while health workers may wait for another brand, there is no assurance when the next one would arrive.
Health workers have expressed concern over the reported low efficacy rate of the Sinovac vaccine.
SAFE VACCINE
Dr. Maria Consorcia Quizon, another NITAG member, said Sinovac is a “safe vaccine.”
“[Sinovac] is safe for use for health care workers. We need to protect them. Since ito ang available ngayon, kailangan nating gamitin para sa kanila (Since this is the one available now, then we must use it for them),” Quizon said.
Vergeire pointed out that safety and efficacy are measured separately and that studies have shown that Sinovac’s vaccine is safe.
Dr. John Wong, a member of the DOH TAG, said while the vaccine’s overall efficacy rate for health workers aged 18 to 59 was at around 50%, it has higher efficacy against more severe cases of the disease.
He said for moderate cases, the efficacy was at 72%, and for severe cases it was at 100%.
“If we had this vaccine last year in NCR, we could have averted 42 health worker deaths and averted 3,300 cases,” he said.
The FDA previously said that the vaccine, which used the traditional inactivated virus platform, only results in common vaccination side effects although more time is needed for observation.
Asked if the DOH will still wait for the recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council, an independent advisory group, a member of the NITAG said it is not necessary since the first batch of 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses were donated.
Vergeire said the vaccines of Sinovac that will arrive on Sunday will be in single dose vials and will not require special syringes.

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News.MANILA — Some local chief executives in Metro Manila and in the provinces bared their respective COVID-19 vaccination plans on Wednesday, highlighting the importance of the local governments' preparedness to be able to convince their constituents to be inoculated against the coronavirus.
In a webinar officiated by Liveable Cities Challenge PH and Globe Telecom, Bacolod City Mayor Bing Leonardia said a COVID-19 vaccination council was created in December last year by the city government, among the first LGUs to create such body.
Leonardia said that out of Bacolod’s population of 624,987, the city government aims to vaccinate 424,992 or 68%. Their budget for the program is P300 million.Some 650,000 sure doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine can cover 325,000 individuals or 76% of the target population. The rest will have to wait for another batch of vaccine allocation.
“The down payment was done last Monday that came about after Malacañang allowed us to make that down payment,” Leonardia said.He said the city is heavily dependent on private-public partnership as volunteers would complement the needed vaccination manpower.They aim to vaccinate 13,500 residents per day in the 27 vaccination centers, or up to 20,000 per day if 40 centers are mobilized.“We have established direction towards this,"" he said.
Barangay registration, as well as a vaccine education program, are ongoing in the city.Bacolod City's cold chain facility is also in place, Leonardia said — a 30 sqm cold room, 1 unit of ultra cold storage good for 80,000 doses and portable vaccine storage of 25 units that would be good for 1.6 million doses.“Last February 11, we delivered our vaccination plan. And yesterday (February 23), we were informed by DOH that our vaccination plan is okay. We are set to go ahead with our vaccination plan,” according to the mayor.
Leonardia said they are active in their campaign against COVID-19 despite registering 0 new cases recently.Losing 190 people to the virus, however, was not something to be taken lightly, according to the mayor.
In a webinar by Liveable Cities Challenge PH, Bacolod City Mayor Bing Leonardia of Bacolod City said, their target to be vaccinated is at 424,992 which is 68% of Bacolod's population of 424,992.

The Philippines is aiming to complete its COVID-19 vaccination program by 2023, according to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.Health authorities in early February conducted simulation on the arrival of the vaccines, transporting it to the cold storage facility at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in less than an hour.
WATCH: When will we get vaccinated vs COVID-19? | NXT
QUEZON CITY
In Quezon City, “QC Protektado sa Bakunang Sigurado” is in place, with pre-vaccination phase starting as early as December 3, said Mayor Joy Belmonte.
There are 1,066,000 priority individuals in the city, including frontline workers in health facilities, senior citizens, persons with comorbidities, other essential workers and the indigent population.Both Quezon City and Makati City have ID systems in place that were previously created to monitor the delivery of services to residents during the pandemic. This would now be used to create a master list of individuals to be vaccinated.“Anyone who lives in Quezon City, regardless if they are voters or not, can avail of the Quezon City ID. You can get a QC resident ID or a non-resident ID. Non-resident ID are for those working for and /or studying because we believe that anyone who contributes to the well-being of the progress and development of our city can and should be vaccinated in our city,” Belmonte said.Quezon City rejects reopening cinemas amid pandemic
Over 1M QC residents in priority list for COVID-19 vaccines: Belmonte
There is an ongoing vaccine confidence campaign as well to encourage more people to receive the shots.
“Since we have started, we have started about 160,000 registries on the master list and we are giving ourselves 6 months, considering the size and scope of the city,” she said.Quezon City partnered with Zuellig Pharma for vaccine handling and rollout.Zuellig will be the one to provide cold storage to Quezon City, but the city will invest on storage when the supplies arrive in vaccination centers.A total of 1.1 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine is being targeted, for a budget of P5 billion, but only more than 500,000 doses have been committed to the city.
“We are still in the process of negotiating with other pharmaceuticals,” Belmonte said.Talks with dioceses are also underway to tap on parishes to serve as additional inoculation areas aside from the already-set 24 sites.
The city has also partnered with hospitals for manpower needs. About 1,200 personnel will be mobilized per an 8 hour shift to conduct vaccinations.
“The Ateneo offered to become our mega-vaccination center,” Belmonte said.
In Quezon City, she pointed out, they have to vaccinate 1.6 million in 6 to 8 months. Some 80% of its residents are above 15 years old, she noted.
For the post-vaccination stage, there will be monitoring of people vaccinated.
QC hotline 122 can be utilized for queries pertaining to the vaccine, and barangay health and other trained workers will monitor and can conduct home visits.
“Every patient will receive a message to tell them when, where, and what time they will be vaccinated... Our goal is to achieve a herd immunity, which is 80% of our population,” Belmonte said.“Most of the people who are undecided or do not want are because they are just afraid, they lack information. That's why our communications plan at present is tailor-fitted to answer the fear of our people,” she added.MAKATI CITYMeanwhile, in Makati City, Mayor Abby Binay said that an initial budget of P1.6 billion has been allotted for its vaccination program, which will also cover business owners and their employees working in the city.
“This program is our way of helping our economic frontliners,” Binay said.The city will have 32 vaccination sites and 104 vaccination teams.
An estimated 500,000 will be vaccinated.Makati firms' employees included in free vaccination program: mayor
“We have converted the Makati coliseum into a mega-vaccination site,” Binay said.There is an online registration for Bakuna Makati. Screening and counseling will be done online.
The Makatizens ID system will be the city’s database in creating the vaccine recipients master list.
The target is to have 11,000 people vaccinated daily, or totally cover the target population in a span of 60-90 days.
“The registration also includes screening, so we can’t launch it too early because some are time-bound, like information of latest vaccine administered, etcetera,” Binay said.“In 2017, we have launched our Makatizens card. So we already have our database plus our voters records. So, we are backtracking for our master list, how many will register,” she added.ORMOC CITYMayor Richard Gomez of Ormoc City said that vaccine access can be challenging in his area of responsibility because while it has a relatively small population, its land area is similar to the size of Metro Manila.
The estimated number of people to be vaccinated in the city is 131,879, out of the city’s more than 240,000 population. They will be divided in 6 districts and would be inoculated through the city's 80 vaccination sites.
Gomez said they would rely on private-public partnership for the vaccination drive, which they target to complete in 14 days.
A private company will handle the logistics for vaccines in Ormoc City.
“Our main storage will be at the Ormoc City Superdome,” Gomez said.
Plans are also in place to convince others who are not yet decided to be vaccinated, as well as for proper disposal of the vaccination waste.
""For the succeeding year, we have set aside budget to make vaccination free since our population is not that big,"" Gomez said.“Since the pandemic started, we have created our QR code system. Anywhere in Ormoc that you go, we supplied about 9,000 plus scanners all over the city. It’s an all-in-one thing. Our COVID registration is here. We are more than 90% done with our registration. We are just waiting for the questionnaires from the Department of Health,” he said.
“Those who were not able to register in our QR code system, their barangay workers wlil go to do house-to-house to get them registered,” he added.Meanwhile, Margaret Bengzon, Senior Health Consultant of the Ayala Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (AC Health), said the private sector is already augmenting the needs of local government units.Bengzon said the benefits of public-private partnership are ""accelerated execution, reduced financial burden, getting more lives saved and leading faster recovery of economic forces.""“The Ayala Group and other private sector partners have been supporting the National Vaccine Deployment Program across various workstreams. IT systems, funding & budget, legal/regulatory & policy, vaccine evaluation,” she said.“AC Health will augment the efforts of our local government hosts. We can deliver as close to an end-to-end vaccination program,” she added.Malacañang said on Thursday that the Philippines would get its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines this weekend, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 doses from Sinovac.
The Philippines, which has Southeast Asia's second highest COVID-19 cases, has lagged behind its regional neighbors in launching its vaccination drive.
The government aims to vaccinate up to 70 million or two-thirds of the population this year.

MANILA — Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended for health workers, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday as it announced the approval of the product for emergency use in the Philippines.
“It has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4% when used on health care workers exposed to COVID-19. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this group,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
Health workers, numbering 1,762,994, top the country's list of priority sectors to receive COVID-19 vaccines once supplies arrive.

Domingo said that Phase III clinical trials done in different countries showed that Sinovac's vaccine has an efficacy rate of 65.3% based on trials in Indonesia, and up to 91.2% based on trials done in Turkey. The trials only involve adults aged 18 to 59 years.
Asked for more information on why health workers are advised not to receive the vaccine, Domingo said, “Ang nakita kasi sa trial sa Brazil, binigay ito sa mga health workers na nagtatrabaho sa hospitals na nagti-treat ng COVID, ay 50.4% ang efficacy n'ya.”
“Mas mabuti naman po iyon kaysa sa wala. Pero ang rekomendasyon ng ating mga experts ay hindi po ito ang pinakamagandang bakuna para sa kanila,” he added.(What they saw in Brazil is that when it was given to health workers working in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, the vaccine only had an efficacy rate of 50.4%. This is better than nothing, but the recommendation of experts is that it is not the best vaccine for health workers.)
The vaccine's efficacy rate is between 63 percent to 91 percent on members of the community who are not healthworkers, Domingo told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo Tuesday,
""Maganda po talaga. Ang mga pagaaral po nila sa mga regular na mamamayan sa community...na hindi naman po exposed na very highly concentrated sa COVID-19 ay maganda ang kaniyang protection rate, umaabot ng 91 percent,"" he said.
(It's good. Their studies on regular members of the community...who are not exposed in areas highly concentrated with COVID-19 is it has a good protection rate that goes up to 91 percent.)

Before the FDA approval of Sinovac, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the firm's vaccine will most likely be the first to arrive in the Philippines this month.
Duque said it will take China 3 to 5 days to prepare the shipment of 600,000 doses it is donating to the Philippines.
When Presidential spokesman Harry Roque first announced over a week ago that the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines on Tuesday, Feb. 23, has been etched in stone, he said 100,000 doses of those will go to the Philippine military.
The delivery of the said supply is expected to be delayed, however, following China's decision to await first the FDA's issuance of an emergency use authorization (EUA).

The FDA has already granted EUA to the vaccines of Pfizer and AstraZeneca, but the shipment of the former under the COVAX Facility has been delayed as well due to the lack then of an indemnification agreement.

ECONOMIC WORKERS FIRST?
When Sinovac's vaccine arrives, Domingo told ABS-CBN News that the Department of Health will set the prioritization for its recipients, excluding health workers.
Roque said that the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG) will meet later Monday to tackle a possible revision in the priority list of recipients for the Sinovac jabs.
“Siguro, kinakailangan nilang baguhin muna iyong ating list of priorities,” he said in a separate briefing.
(Perhaps, they need to first change our list of priorities.)
“Baka mauna na iyong ating tinatawag na economic frontliners na kasama po ng ating kasundaluhan.”(Our so-called economic frontliners might go first with our military.)
Economic frontliners include those who continued to work during last year’s enhance community quarantine, the strictest of 4 lockdown levels in the country, Roque said.Establishments like supermarkets, groceries, drugstores, and other service-oriented centers were allowed to operate during the ECQ.
The DOH has yet to respond to questions on whether it will follow the FDA’s recommendation and what will happen if Sinovac’s vaccines arrive first in the country.
Nearly 15,000 health workers in the Philippines have been infected with COVID-19, of whom, 249 were battling the disease, as of Feb. 20.
At the peak of the outbreak, health workers comprised 20% of infected individuals in the country. It has since gone down to 3%, although health workers remain among those most exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Meanwhile, recipients of the 100,000 doses from Sinovac's donation intended for the Department of National Defense and its bureaus will be administered by the Veterans Medical Center and V. Luna Medical Center, according to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.
He clarified that the Armed Forces of the Philippines will not received any of those.
""Two doses kasi, kaya 50,000 lang ang kaya ng 100K. Tama lang sa DND personnel and their families,"" said Lorenzana.
(Since it requires two doses, only 50,000 recipients can avail of the 100,000 doses. It's just right for DND personnel and their families.)
The defense chief earlier expressed willingness to be inoculated with Sinovac's vaccine. But, upon learning that he doesn't fall within the recommended age range of recipients, he said he would wait for the next vaccine instead.

Thomas Peter, Reuters/File
The 50% efficacy rate of the Sinovac vaccine from China has made headlines recently.
For the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology, the 50% efficacy is ""acceptable"" given that is the minimum requirement set by the World Health Organization. The Department of Health also agreed, reassuring Filipinos that the Chinese vaccine indeed meets international standards.
Still, many have expressed concern as the reported efficacy of Sinovac lags behind the 95% efficacy rate of Pfizer and the 94% of Moderna's.
Where are we in the COVID-19 vaccine race?
So, what does 50% actually mean? How does it translate to real life? Let’s do the math.
For instance, 50,000 participants in a clinical trial were split evenly between the vaccine and placebo groups. Of the 300 COVID-19 cases that were found, 200 were in the placebo group and only 100 were in the vaccine group. Mathematically, the efficacy rate is then equivalent to a 50% risk reduction. In this particular example, getting a vaccine reduced the infection risk to half of those unvaccinated.
So here is what the efficacy rate means — and what it doesn’t mean.
A 50% efficacy rate indicates that a person is 50% less likely to become infected relative to someone who didn’t get the vaccine.
This does not mean that half of those who took the vaccine won’t get COVID-19 and the other half will. The efficacy rate is always relative to the risk of those who are exposed to the virus.
Because of this, it's important to know the infection risk for those who didn't get the vaccine. If we use the positivity rate of 5% as a proxy (the positivity rate of the Philippines in the last two weeks), then the risk of getting COVID-19 for those who took a vaccine of 50% efficacy is reduced to 2.5%. That is how the math works.
Testing statistics on December 26:- 14,291 tests, less than 15,000 for the 2nd straight day ⬇️
- 805 positives reported by labs
- 6.0% daily positivity rate ⚠️
- 8.4% cumulative positivity rate
- 24 testing backlogs- 529,787 positives (Dec 26)
- 469,886 confirmed (Dec 27) https://t.co/DOgtMk1mQT pic.twitter.com/qfB2UlD6aq — Edson (@EdsonCGuido) December 27, 2020
However, it’s important to note that the efficacy rates were derived from clinical trials that happened under a controlled environment. These conditions may or may not be met in the real world. Hence, it’s possible that there will be a difference between the reported efficacy rates and the effectiveness of the vaccines.
Pfizer and Moderna vaccines need to be stored in lower temperatures to maintain their efficacy and the cold chain infrastructure will be a logistical challenge in some areas. Furthermore, with most COVID-19 vaccines requiring two doses, previous studies have shown that not everyone comes back for the second dose. These are just some of the hurdles that may potentially change efficacy rates in the real world.
To sum, a 50% efficacy rate doesn’t mean that the vaccine only works half of the time. Rather, this rate means the vaccine halved the chances of people who got the vaccine from becoming sick relative to those who didn’t get the vaccine.

MANILA — Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Friday said the World Health Organization’s decision to list Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use will help fast-track the Philippines’ approval process.

“The one from WHO is a welcome addition to the regulatory approvals and therefore that would be a lot easier for the local FDA (Food and Drug Administration), to already review all the documents and assess the risk benefit ratio of the said candidate vaccine,” he said during a televised press conference at the East Avenue Medical Center.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo also told ABS-CBN News that the WHO emergency use listing ""is very significant.”
“Our experts are currently evaluating the documents submitted by Pfizer as outlined in our guidelines. I will issue a decision on the application as soon as all the regulatory requirements and procedures are completed,” he said in a statement.
Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine were among the first to declare its efficacy rate against COVID-19. With an efficacy rate of 95%, their vaccine was soon approved for emergency use by the United States and the United Kingdom.
They are also the only one so far that has applied for emergency use in the Philippines.
The FDA said it might be able to issue emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine by January.

With the emergency use authority powers granted to the FDA, the Philippines would be able to expedite its approval process for developmental drugs, especially for COVID-19.
The WHO on Friday said the Pfizer vaccine passed its safety criteria and has proven that its benefits outweigh the risks.
Duque was previously criticized for supposedly not being able to clinch a deal with Pfizer. This was denied by Duque who said the application still needed to undergo due process. He also said Pfizer never promised to provide the country 10 million doses as claimed by critics.

“So ganoon ang gagawin natin, so susulat ako sa Red Cross, kay Senator (Richard) Gordon na x amount of vaccine ang ire-request.”
Marcial said by reaching out to the Red Cross the league could get AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines, but previous reports said the nonprofit group has only been engaged in talks with AstraZeneca and Pfizer.

PBA teams have regularly participated in EASL competitions since it was founded in 2016, with NLEX, San Miguel Beer, Blackwater, and TNT Tropang Giga among the squads to have played in the Terrific 12 tournament as part of their preseason preparations.
But EASL events will have a new format now that it has partnered with FIBA Asia.In October 2021, it will launch a new competition, where the region's top 8 teams will compete in a home-and-away group stage. It will culminate in a final 4 in February to determine the champion, runner-up, and third-place team.
With the pandemic, the 2 leagues' plans could change.
According to Marcial, he has spoken to PBA team representatives and they agreed a vaccine must be in play first before they go ahead with competition.“Naka-hold muna the decision to join East Asia hanggang wala pang vaccine,” Marcial said.

MANILA — The COVID-19 vaccine of Pfizer can still be deployed to other areas in the Philippines depending on the ultra cold storage options that will be offered by the private sector, the health department said Monday.
“Initially, we have these facilities na sabi natin kaya natin sa Metro Manila, Cebu, sa Davao, Region 3, Region 4A. But as time will go by, maraming partners na nag-o-offer sa atin ng ganitong facilities and equipment. So we will see,"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual briefing.

Pfizer’s vaccine, which uses new messenger RNA-based technology, has to be kept in a -70 degrees Celsius freezer, unlike the other COVID-19 vaccines. However, it also has the highest efficacy rate at 95%, based on current data.
Because of the cold storage requirement, government officials said it might only be deployed in urban areas.LGUs, private firms told to follow gov't standards on COVID-19 vaccine storage

Dr. Eva Maria Cutiongco-de la Paz, executive director of the National Institutes of Health in the University of the Philippines, said there will have to be different protocols in the handling of different vaccines.
This is especially true for Pfizer and Moderna, which also has an mRNA vaccine requiring -20 degrees Celsius storage. Both vaccines can be thawed and kept in regular refrigerator temperature, but Pfizer’s vaccine has to be administered within 5 days while Moderna’s can be kept there for 30 days.
De la Paz said it is important to note that vaccine distribution can take an average of 4 to 6 months, from the factory to the country of destination.
The vaccine cold chain involves a global network of cold rooms, freezers, refrigerators, cold boxes and carriers to “keep vaccines at just the right temperature during each"" stage.
She said other vaccines have also been kept in ultra low freezers before, such as the Ebola vaccine, which requires -70 degrees Celsius storage temperature.
De la Paz said the country faces a couple of challenges when it comes to the cold chain. The country will need uninterrupted electrical supply, storage space, ultra cold freezers and dry ice. She said there are generators in place in case of power interruptions.
“We will be needing more storage capacity for NCR if we are talking about the COVID-19 vaccine,” she said based on a previous survey they did among local government units.She said there are still other vaccines that need to be kept in the existing storage units and cannot be displaced by the COVID-19 vaccines.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines has a financing plan to purchase at least 40 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines once it becomes available to be administered for free to the poorest 20 million Filipinos, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said Friday.
The Department of Health can procure the approved vaccines with the help of the Philippine International Trading Corp and financed by the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines, Dominguez said in a televised address.
The PITC, under the Department of Trade and Industry, is engaged in trading and bulk importation of essential goods for the government including medicines, among others.
Vaccines being developed across the world could be approved before December, he said. Purchased vaccines will be turned over to the DOH, he added.

""May financing plan kami dyan. Ang estimate we will need to vaccinate for free for a minimum of 20 million people...The financing is available for this program,"" Dominguez said.
(We have a financing plan for that. Our estimate is that we will need to vaccinate for free for a minimum of 20 million people)
""Poorest of the poor muna (first), lowest 20 million of our country,"" he added.
If the 20 million poorest Filipinos need 2 shots each, estimated at $10 (P500) per dose, that would be $400 million or ""roughly P20 billion,"" Dominguez said.
Landbank and the DBP are capable of financing that P20 billion, which is payable in 2 to 3 years, he said.
At P500 per dose, a vaccine shot inclusive of service and transport could cost about P1,200, he said.
Dominguez said the economy ""is actually beginning to recover,"" after contracting in the first quarter. Third quarter numbers are expected to be released on Aug. 6.
""It’s already picking up now And we’re going to be seeing a pickup in business activity as we go on,"" he said.
The economy is ""not short on money,"" the Peso is the ""strongest in Asia"" and inflation is also within target, he said.

MANILA - Sixty-six percent of adult Filipinos are willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine is currently available, a Social Weather Stations (SWS) phone survey revealed.The survey, conducted September 17-20, 2020, showed that 32 percent of Filipinos said they will ""definitely"" get the vaccine while 34 percent said they would ""probably"" get the vaccine, for a total of 66 percent.
Thirty-one percent of those surveyed said they are unwilling to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Of this percentage, 14 percent said they ""probably"" won't get the vaccine, while 17 percent said they ""definitely"" would not get the vaccine.
The survey also found that Filipinos are more willing to get the vaccine against COVID-19, compared to a similar survey in 2019 involving the Dengvaxia vaccine.
According to SWS, a 2019 survey asked Filipinos whether the sale of the Dengvaxia vaccine should be allowed in the Philippines, of which 62 percent said it should be disallowed in the country.
Only 42 percent of respondents were willing to get the Dengvaxia vaccine at that time.
The survey, likewise, showed that more people from Mindanao are willing to get the vaccine at 73 percent, compared to 69 percent in the Visayas, 64 percent in Metro Manila and 61 percent in Balance Luzon.
The willingness to get the vaccine is also higher among men and those from the younger groups.
Seventy-one percent of men are willing to get the vaccine, compared to 60 percent of women.
The willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is also higher among those aged 25 to 30 years old compared to other age groups.
A total of 1,249 adult Filipinos 18 years old and above participated in the National Mobile Phone Survey, which was conducted using a mobile phone and computer-assisted telephone interviewing.SWS said Filipino's willingness to get the vaccine is between that of New Zealand (74 percent) and the United States (59 percent).
The data from New Zealand is based on a survey conducted by the Massey University from June 26 to July 13, 2020, while the data from the United States is based on surveys by the Pew Research Center and Gallup.
The survey has a sampling error margin of ±3% for national percentages, ±6% for Metro Manila, ±5% for Balance Luzon, ±6% for the Visayas, and ±6% for Mindanao.
Respondents were asked the question: ""Kung mayroong bakunang makakapigil sa Covid-19 sa ngayon, kayo ba ay… (Talagang magpapabakuna, Malamang magpapabakuna, Malamang na hindi magpapabakuna, Talagang hindi magpapabakuna)? [If a vaccine to prevent Covid-19 were available today, would you… (Definitely get the vaccine, Probably get the vaccine, Probably not get the vaccine, Definitely not get the vaccine)]”.It is patterned after the Pew Research Center surveys in the US, conducted from April 29 to May 5, 2020 and September 8-13, 2020.
An earlier SWS survey also showed that 80 percent of Filipinos are expecting the COVID-19 vaccine to be available soon.

The final analysis comes just one week after initial results from the trial showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective. Moderna Inc. on Monday released preliminary data for its vaccine, showing similar effectiveness.

The Department of Health (DOH), however, said that two of the COVID-19 vaccine frontrunners are not interested in conducting clinical trials in the Philippines but are open to distribution here.
“Pfizer and Moderna, they do not intend to have clinical trials here in the country,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a virtual briefing.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/01/08/21/chinese-expert-says-misquoted-on-post-about-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccines-side-effects-report,Chinese expert says misquoted on post about Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine’s side effects - report,ABS-CBN News,Jan 08 2021 07:39 PM,"MANILA — A vaccine expert from China who reportedly criticized the side effects caused by Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine clarified that his statement was supposedly meant as a disclaimer but that his words were taken out of context by foreign media.
In an interview on Global Times, an English-language Chinese newspaper under China-based People's Daily, Tao Lina said he listed Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine side effects satirically on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, for being lengthy.

FDA on Sinovac’s history of bribery: ‘Huwag nilang subukang manuhol’
He also reportedly pointed out that because such side effects are listed on the manual, patients who experience adverse reactions won’t be able to sue the state-owned pharmaceutical firm.


A Taiwan news report recently carried Tao’s statement, saying he had called the Chinese-made vaccine the “most unsafe in the world.”
""I did not say in the post that the Chinese vaccine was unsafe, because I know most of those 73 adverse reactions written on the Sinopharm vaccine user guide are non-existent,"" Tao was quoted as saying.
“You can never put too much emphasis on safety and efficacy. The attempts to discredit the image of Chinese vaccines' safety really makes me annoyed,” he added.
The Global Times report also said the Shanghai-based expert regretted that foreign media twisted his words to “support its own narrative” by emphasizing Tao’s expertise and him being a “former employee of the Shanghai disease prevention and control department.”
“This ironic way of pointing out the safety and efficacy of the Chinese vaccine was distorted by foreign media,” he said.
But Tao still defended his post on Weibo, which was allegedly taken down by authorities according to Taiwanese media.
He explained that Sinopharm vaccine's user guide had improper instructions written, and that it was inconclusive to say that “extreme adverse reactions such as high blood pressure are directly related to the vaccine.”
""It is possible that some irresponsible temporary employee made this user guide, which could have been wrongly written,"" he said.
Among the over 70 side effects mentioned in the Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine manual that he posted include pain, swelling and itching on the vaccination area.
The manual also reportedly mentioned headache, fever, muscle pain, difficulty breathing and diarrhea as common “systemic adverse reactions.”
Listed as “occasional” effects are anorexia and vomiting while “very rare” effects include asthma, tonsillitis, eye pain, vision loss, earache, high blood pressure, urinary incontinence and delayed menstruation.
Sinopharm is among the COVID-19 vaccine frontrunners. Its vaccine is already on limited use in China, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. It also claims to have a 79% efficacy rate against COVID-19.

Senate Committee on Finance chair Sonny Angara presented a table that compares the projected prices of 7 COVID-19 vaccine brands, including value added taxes and the cost of inflation.
NOVAVAX
Based on the data, the Philippines can inoculate its entire population against COVID-19 twice over should it procure the cheapest available vaccine in the market from US-based pharmaceutical company Novavax.
The US-produced COVID-19 drug is estimated to cost the government P366 for 2 doses, which means that the P82.5 billion vaccine fund under the 2021 budget could cover the inoculation of some 225.4 million people, more than double the Philippines' 106 million population.
But the the Novavax COVID vaccine remains on its third phase of trial, lagging behind China's Sinovac, UK's AstraZeneca, US's Pfizer, and Russia's Gamaleya, which are already in talks with the Philippine government.

ASTRAZENECA
British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which inked a deal with the Philippines for 2.6 million doses of the vaccine, costs about 2 times higher than Novavax's product, but showed an average 70 percent effectiveness.
That rate jumped to 90 percent when an initial half-dose then a full dose was given, similar to the effectiveness of rival vaccines producers Pfizer and Moderna.
Priced at P610 for 2 doses, the Philippines can have up to 135.24 million people inoculated should it spend its entire P82.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine fund for the purchase of AstraZeneca's product.
Philippines, private firms sign vaccine supply deal with AstraZeneca
Last week, more private firms expressed interest in joining the government's supply deal with the AstraZeneca, thanks to the British vaccine-maker's high effectiveness and low price point.
More firms want to join AstraZeneca supply deal: gov't adviser
GAMALEYA
The COVID-19 vaccine from Russia's Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology is estimated to cost P1,220 for 2 doses.
This means that only 67.62 million Filipinos, about half the number of beneficiaries under AstraZeneca's price, could be inoculated should the government use its 2021 COVID-19 vaccine fund for this product.
Gamaleya earlier asserted that its vaccine is 92 percent effective, but the company has yet to submit documents to prove its claim, according to Dr. Nina Gloriani, University of the Philippines College of Public Health professor and head of the Department of Science and Technology’s vaccine technical panel.
""They have provided us with animal studies Phases I and II data. But their Phase 3 study protocol . . . still has some missing information. So we have requested that. And the informed consent has not been submitted,"" Gloriani earlier said.
""We want the scientific data. We cannot rely on what is published in the internet,"" she said.

PFIZER
While Pfizer's P2,379-vaccine (for 2 doses) is more expensive compared to other brands, the US-produced drug is known to have one of the highest effectiveness rate at at least 90 percent.
Pfizer is also hailed as the first COVID-19 vaccine that earned an approval from a government after the United Kingdom jumped ahead to begin its most crucial mass inoculation program using the said brand.
UK approves Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, first in the world
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine as ""very promising"", but some buyers have been turned off by the product's cold chain issues.
Unlike its rivals, Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below to maintain its efficacy.
Sen. Aquilino ""Koko"" Pimentel said he hopes that the bulk of the COVID-19 vaccine fund would be used to procure the actual drug instead of additional equipment for storage.
""Sana hindi na tayo magtayo pa ng freezers, renting freezers just so vaccines can be brought to different parts of the archipelago,"" he said, without naming a particular brand.
(I hope we don't need to spend to build or rent freezers just so vaccines can be brought to different parts of the archipelago.)

Pfizer has been reportedly working on solving its COVID-19 vaccine's cold storage issues.
SINOVAC
China's Sinovac appears to be the second most expensive COVID-19 vaccine based initial estimates, as it is expected to be priced at P3,629.50 for 2 doses.
At this price point, the Philippine government can inoculate 22.73 million Filipinos, or about a quarter of the population, against COVID-19 next year.
Aside from its high price, the legitimacy of Sinovac products was recently questioned after the Washington Post reported that the company's chief executive officer admitted to bribery.
Citing court records, the Washington Post said that Sinovac's CEO had admitted to giving more than $83,000 (P3.99 million) to a regulatory official from 2002 to 2011 to expedite certifications for its SARS vaccine and a swine flu vaccines.
The Department of Health earlier said that Philippines' vaccine panels would look into reports.

MODERNA
Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is estimated to be the most expensive option with a price tag ranging between P3,904 and P4,504 for 2 doses, depending on how many vials are ordered.
A recent study showed that the vaccine from the Massachusetts-based company could trigger the human immune system to produce COVID-19 antibodies that lasts for at least 3 months.
The Moderna vaccine also boasts of having a 94 percent effectiveness rate.

Last month, the European Union secured 160 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine taking the EU's potential stock of COVID-19 shots to nearly 2 billion.

OTHER COSTS
Angara noted that the estimates have yet to cover the cost of other items needed for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines.
The government needs to spend P1,200 for the training of one vaccinator for every 350 people, and another P1,924 for personal protective equipment, needles and syringes used during the inoculation process, according to the data presented in the Senate.
The Senate earlier agreed to hike the COVID-19 vaccine fund to P83 billion next year, but the fund was reduced at P72.5 billion after the bicameral conference committee realigned portions of the sum to other programs under the 2021 budget.

Executive department officials have yet to discuss to lawmakers details of the national government's COVID-19 vaccination program, Angara told other senators.
""It's a rough estimate. It's a moving target,"" he said.
""Hindi pa po maliwanag . . . At least wala pa po at my level pero someone from the IATF (Inter Agency Task Force) may be discussing it.""

Health officials earlier said that at least 70 percent of the population should receive 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine before Filipinos can develop a herd immunity against the virus that has forced economies around the world to impose lockdowns and plunge into recessions.

MANILA - Some Filipinos are looking for ways to get inoculated against COVID-19 as the government has yet to say with certainty the schedule of the availability of the vaccine against the new coronavirus in the Philippines, a health expert said Monday.
But, according to Dr. Tony Leachon, who used to be part of the inter-agency task force against COVID-19, getting the vaccine from the black market could sabotage the government's vaccination program.
Leachon told ABS-CBN News that aside from the black market, some Filipinos are also planning to travel abroad because they have a higher chance of getting the vaccine there.
""One reason is that they are actually uncertain of the exact timeline of the arrival of the vaccine,"" he said, noting that this is a ""normal behavioral response"" when the supply for a drug is limited.
""Because of the global vaccination..., siyempre, if you are a Filipino, maiinggit ka (If you are a Filipino, you'll be envious),"" he said.

Leachon said some Filipino green card holders are keen on being inoculated in the United States where the vaccines are already being rolled out.
""Some of my patients would like to go to the US this March. Iniisip nila, by that time, 'yung priority list ng America, more or less, they would go to the Phase 2. So, baka makakuha sila doon, lalo na kung green card holder yung iba,"" he said.
(They think that by that time, the US will already be in the Phase 2 of their priority list. So maybe they can get vaccines there, especially if they are green card holders.)
""'Yung iba, gusto pumunta ng Singapore... kasi dumating na yung sa Singapore at mas malapit ang Singapore,"" he said.
(Others want to go to Singapore... because the vaccines have arrived in Singapore and it's closer to the Philippines.)

Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said the country would begin its inoculation program for high-risk individuals and poor families in March.
As of Monday, the Philippines has yet to approve the use and sale of any COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
ADVANTAGE OF THE WEALTHY AND PRIVILEGED
Despite the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) frequent reminder that it is illegal to receive vaccines that have yet to receive government approval, several soldiers and members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) have already been inoculated against COVID-19.

Sen. Panfilo Lacson and House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez were earlier reported to have received the vaccine this year, but both lawmakers have neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.
This is not the first time the rich and the privileged secured COVID-19-related items ahead of those who need it more, Leachon said.
""It happened already during the first few months of the (COVID-19) laboratory testing,"" he said.
""There were limited supplies of the test kits. At that time, 2,000 kits lang (only). We heard real stories na (that) some politicians or influential persons na naka-una dun sa testing, rather than 'yung mga naka-admit (were tested first, rather than those who were admitted in hospitals),"" he said.
""It's a natural phenomenon, if you are rich and you wouldn't mind the cost of the vaccine.""
DOH explains why President, other officials tested for COVID-19 amid kit shortage
Getting the vaccine early or late for one or two people does not matter, Leachon said, noting that herd immunity against COVID-19 can only be achieved when more than half of the population have been inoculated.
""Pangmaramihan siya magiging effective... kaya natin ginawang mass vaccination in order to achieve herd immunity,"" he said.
(It needs to be administered to a lot of people for it to be effective... That's why we want a mass vaccination in order to achieve herd immunity.)
""Akala mo protected ka, pero mas mae-enhance ang protection mo kung mas marami ang mababakunahan.""
(You think you are protected. But your protection can only be enhanced when more people are vaccinated.)
INDIVIDUAL INOCULATION MAY 'SABOTAGE' PH'S COVID-19 VACCINE PROGRAM
Filipinos who are trying to get inoculated against COVID-19 on their own may end up ""sabotaging"" the Philippines' COVID-19 inoculation program, Leachon warned.
""That only problem is the black market because you don't know the efficacy and safety of the particular vaccine,"" he said.
Vaccinations done without the government's permission may ""skew"" the data on whether or not the Philippines has already vaccinated 60 percent of its population, the number needed for the country to develop herd immunity against COVID-19.
""You would not know right now who are the patients that would be given double vaccination,"" Leachon said.
""At this point in time, we do not know the effect of double vaccination... or an overdose,"" he added.
He said those who receive the vaccines from unregistered sources may end up experiencing ""unpredictable adverse events"" which may discourage other Filipinos from availing of the vaccine from the government.
""[It] may actually lead to a sabotage of the national program of the government, considering the low acceptability of the Filipinos to vaccination,"" he said.
The ""delay"" in the Philippines' procurement of the COVID-19 vaccine ""created"" the mad rush for some Filipinos to source vaccines on their own, he said.
The Philippines was supposed to get some 10 million doses from US-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer as early as January 2021, but Duque's failure to submit documentary requirements on time botched the initial deal, Lacson earlier said.
Duque said talks with Pfizer are still on going, with FDA hoping to authorize the use of the company's vaccines in the country next month.
PH’s FDA hopes to issue emergency use authorization for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine by Jan.
Aside from speeding up its vaccine procurement, the government should intensify its education and awareness programs about the COVID-19 vaccine, Leachon advised.
""Kailangan meron tayong structured education to the public to explain and ilagay din yung penalties for doing that (illegal procurement),"" he said.
(There should be a structured education to the public to explain it, and included in that is a list of penalties for the illegal procurement of vaccines.)
""Sasabihin din ng FDA at DOH na unwarranted or illegal vaccination of these products may result to lack of efficacy and adverse events. So you put them in a position that they will not do that kasi matatakot sila,"" he said.
(The FDA and the DOH should also notify the public that unwarranted or illegal vaccination using these products may result to lack of efficacy and adverse events. So you put them in a position that they will not do that because they are afraid of the repercussions.)
The efficacy rate and what it really means
Where are we in the COVID-19 vaccine race?
The 2021 national budget includes PhP72.5 billion for the purchase, storage, transportation and distribution of vaccines against COVID-19, according to President Rodrigo Duterte. It is expected to cover the inoculation of the poorest families, elderly, and other high-risk individuals.
Congress is pushing to pass a new aid package next year to boost the Philippines' vaccine fund to hopefully hasten the return of normalcy in the country.

Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News
MANILA — The OCTA Group on Monday said it is seeing a continued increase in COVID-19 cases in some parts of the National Capital Region (NCR), which may push the country's total to 665,000 by the end of the month.
This as the country finally started its rollout of COVID-19 vaccines using donations from China.
READ: PGH head receives first ever COVID-19 vaccine jab in PH
In a written report, professors from the University of the Philippines and the University of Santo Tomas who comprise the research group said that the NCR averaged 942 daily cases in the last 4 days.
“Before tumaas, nag-average tayo ng 400 cases per day sa Metro Manila. Ngayon, for the past 4 days, ang average natin 900. So, dumoble or more pa nga,"" Dr. Guido David, an OCTA Fellow, told ABS-CBN in a video call.
""Mabilis itong pagtaas ng cases,” he noted.(Before the increase in cases, we were averaging 400 cases per day in Metro Manila. Now, for the past 4 days, our average doubled to 900. The increase is fast.)
The OCTA Group bases its analysis on the R naught or reproduction number of COVID-19. A reproduction number of more than 1 means that the infection is spreading to more people since one infected person can infect one or more people.
The group said the reproduction number for NCR, home to roughly a tenth of the country's a little over 100 million population, increased to 1.5.
Asked what could be the cause of the spike in cases, David said, “Meron kaming strong suspicion na ito (UK variant) yung nagda-drive ng transmission sa mga areas na 'yan.”
(We have a strong suspicion that the UK variant is driving the transmission in those areas.)
The UK variant, which has been detected in the Philippines, is said to be more transmissible. So far, 62 cases of such variant have been recorded in the country.
David said the rise in COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila follows a pattern similar to that of Cebu City and Mountain Province, where the UK variant was detected.
The NCR cities that recorded “steep upward trends” are Pasay, Quezon, Manila, Makati, Malabon, Taguig, Paranaque and Navotas.
The OCTA Group said Valenzuela, Caloocan and Las Pinas had a smaller increase in new cases.
Among cities, Cebu City still has the most number of new cases per day at around 200. Other cities outside Metro Manila included in the Top 10 areas reporting the most number of new cases are Lapu-Lapu, Davao and Mandaue.
“Under the current trend, the number of new COVID-19 cases per day (for NCR) will increase from its current average daily value of 770 to 2,200 by the end of March 2021,” the OCTA Group said.
The country is expected to reach 665,000 total cases and 14,000 total deaths if the Philippines is unable to curb the spread of the disease.
As of Monday, the country's total infections stood at 578,381, including 12,322 deaths.
Over the weekend, the ABS-CBN Data Analytics pointed out the almost 8% positivity rate in the country, with NCR and Region 7 also showing a surge.

David said that with the continued increase in cases, Filipinos should strictly follow health protocols such as the wearing of masks and physical distancing.“Itong vaccine rollout, hindi natin makikita ang effects nito sa number of cases,” he said. “Sa ibang countries, nakapag-vaccinate sila ng 20% of the population bago nakakita ng decrease of cases.”
(We won’t see the effects of the vaccine rollout in the number of cases for now… In other countries, they only saw a decrease in cases when they vaccinated 20% of their population.)

PCOO-OGMPA
MANILA (UPDATE) — Philippine General Hospital (PGH) head Gerardo Legaspi on Monday received the first authorized dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines, just several hours after a batch of donated doses from the Chinese company Sinovac arrived in the country.
In a live feed of the vaccination via PTV, Legaspi received the CoronaVac jab from PGH nurse Chareluck Santos.
After being inoculated, he presented a certificate showing that he received the vaccine.

""Ang asawa ko po at anak, kinausap ko kahapon dahil hyper-allergic sila, malamang itong bakuna ang i-recommend ko sa kanila,"" Legaspi said during a briefing after he was vaccinated.
(I talked to my wife and child yesterday, and because they are hyper-allergic, I might recommend this for them.)
Meet Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the first to be officially vaccinated against COVID-19 in PH
The vaccine developed by Sinovac is said to have only common vaccine side effects. No adverse or serious side effects or allergic reactions have been observed among those vaccinated with it.
Second to be vaccinated is Dr. Edsel Salvana, who is part of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group and also a PGH doctor.
Next in line was Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo.

Legaspi and the other vaccine recipients were monitored for 30 minutes for possible side effects.
Also vaccinated at the PGH were Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos, Jr. and vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque was also seen being screened for the Sinovac vaccine. But the tight supply of the shots prevented him from getting inoculated.
""Ako po, willing mabakunahan. Kaya lang, kagaya ng sinabi ni [PGH Director] Dr. Gap Legaspi ay ubos na iyong 100 [doses] nila for the day ‘no. We will have to come back on another day,"" Roque told reporters in an online briefing.
(I am wiling to get vaccinated. But, as Dr. Gap Legaspi said, their 100-dose allocation for the day has been used up.)
During his speech before the vaccination, Galvez said that while there are other vaccines with higher efficacy rate, “There is no such best vaccine dahil ang pinaka-best vaccine ay yung effective at efficient na dumarating ng mas maaga.”
(There is no such best vaccine because the best vaccine is the one that is effective and efficient that arrived earlier.)
PGH spokesman Dr. Jonas Del Rosario, who was earlier reported to be the first to receive the shot, said he was not vaccinated after latest tests showed he had a high amount of antibodies after recovering from COVID-19 last year.
He said he expects more health workers to get inoculated after 90 percent of PGH workers said they preferred a different vaccine.The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian country to receive initial vaccine supplies, fueling concerns over recovery prospects for a consumption-driven economy that suffered its worst slump on record last year due to the lengthy coronavirus lockdowns.A total of 1,200 doses were sent to the PGH on Monday after the Chinese company’s vaccines arrived in the country on Sunday.
Sinovac has an efficacy rate of 65.3% to 91.2%, based on vaccinations in Indonesia and Turkey. But its efficacy rate among health workers exposed to COVID-19 in Brazil was only 50.4%.While this is above the World Health Organization benchmark of 50%, it is significantly lower than other vaccine frontrunners like Pfizer and Moderna with 95% efficacy.
The Philippines has issued emergency use authorization for Sinovac, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Pfizer was supposed to be the first COVID-19 vaccine with an EUA to arrive in the Philippines, but it was delayed due to the indemnification agreement requirement.
There have been reports of smuggled COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines. Last year, members of the Presidential Security Group were inoculated using the vaccine candidate of another Chinese drugmaker, Sinopharm.

Galvez said he was personally instructed by President Rodrigo Duterte to be vaccinated at the PGH to address the low confidence of health workers towards Sinovac.
“Kahapon, binigyan niya (Duterte) ako ng utos na 'Magpabakuna ka para at least it will make them (health workers) feel na ang ating pamahalaan, ang lahat ng mga bakuna na inaangkat natin ay safe and effective',” said Galvez, a retired military general.
(Yesterday, he ordered me to be vaccinated so at least it will make health workers feel that our government is importing vaccines that are safe and effective.)
Health workers are first in line in the Philippines’ priority recipients of COVID-19 vaccines.

Surveys from different hospitals showed high confidence in the vaccines against the coronavirus.l But some reports, like that of PGH, showed a much lower rate of health workers willing to be vaccinated with Sinovac’s vaccine.
Galvez said that while efficacy rate in preventing COVID-19 may only be at 50%, there is 100% protection against severe illness and death.
Other hospitals that received vials of the Sinovac vaccine were military hospital V. Luna Medical Center; Dr. Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Tala, Caloocan; the Pasig City General Hospital; the Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame; and the Lung Center of the Philippines.Of the 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines, 100,000 are supposed to be allocated for the Department of National Defense (DND).
In a statement, the DND said it will initially inoculate 14,520 individuals using 29,040 doses, and the remaining 70,960 doses will be given to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
The government aims to vaccinate 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year, depending on the supply of vaccines.
Expected to arrive next are doses from AstraZeneca through the COVAX Facility, which aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.

Besides the donated doses, the Philippines is also expected to procure vaccines from Sinovac.

The Philippines has seen a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some areas like several cities in Metro Manila. Currently, there are a total of 578,381 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country, of which, 31,708 or 5.5 percent are active infections.

Besides the increase in cases in some areas, the Philippines is also monitoring the possible spread of new COVID-19 variants of concern, some of which are said to be more transmissible.
The Philippines' first COVID-19 case was reported on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.

MANILA - The Philippines' vaccine czar on Tuesday said the country’s supply of vaccines from British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca are not affected by issues of the European Union.President Rodrigo Duterte had accused the EU of holding up exports of COVID-19 vaccines to other countries, particularly from AstraZeneca, after the bloc announced that it was placing export controls of COVID-19 vaccines to protect its own supplies.

Vaccine czar and National Task Force on COVID-19 chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. noted that the Philippines would not have a problem in securing supplies of AstraZeneca vaccines, as the jabs would be manufactured in Thailand.

“'Yun po ang realidad na talagang sa ngayon, nakikita natin na may pulitika ang EU at UK, considering nakita natin na
ang British government is needing the vaccine very much because of the UK variant,” Galvez said on Tuesday's public briefing.
(That's the reality, that currently, we see there's politics in EU and UK, and that the British government also needs the vaccine very much because of the UK variant.)
“Nakita natin na sila they are haggling for supply, pero sa atin po, wala pong problema dahil ang ating suplay ay galing sa plant ng Thailand at saka mayroon tayong another plant sa Serum Institute of India na pwede tayong magkaroon ng tie-up. And possibly, dun po ma-resolve 'yung logistical requirement po natin,” he said.
(We know that they are haggling for supply, but for us, we don't have a problem since our supply will be coming from Thailand and another plant at the Serum Institute of India, which can have a tie-up. And possibly, the logistical requirement may be resolved there.)
Galvez said the NTF is even set to conduct a virtual inspection of AstraZeneca’s manufacturing plant in Thailand on Wednesday.
The drugmaker said last week it would fall short of delivering promised vaccines to the EU, igniting a backlash from the bloc.
The EU is now looking into a scheme to monitor and authorize export of vaccines, potentially blocking them if its own supply is not met.

Screenshot, UN Web TV
MANILA - In his first appearance at the UN General Assembly, President Rodrigo Duterte said all countries should get access to coronavirus vaccines once these have been developed, deemed effective and distributed to the public.
In a pre-recorded video message to the UN convention that aired early Wednesday (Manila time), Duterte emphasized ""ensuring universal access"" to medicines and technology to combat COVID-19 ""is pivotal in the global pandemic recovery.""
""The world is in the race to find a safe and effective vaccine. When the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor withheld. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy,"" he said during the UN's 75th anniversary.
""The Philippines joins our partners in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the Non-Aligned Movement in raising our collective voice: the COVID-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good.""
Duterte earlier called out Western countries and companies for allegedly profiting from the coronavirus pandemic.
Duterte prefers COVID-19 vaccines from China, Russia
A worldwide race for a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with at least 9 pharmaceutical firms in the US and Europe in late-stage trials.
Duterte urged UN members to pool resources to ""empower"" the World Health Organization, which has been battered by the pandemic and criticisms from some countries, like the United States.
""We need a WHO that is quick to coordinate and quicker to respond. The Philippines will do its part in the pooling of global resources. Our health workers are among the best,"" he said.
BIGGEST TEST SINCE WWII
The President said the pandemic is the ""biggest test"" the world and the UN is facing since World War 2.
""We are at a crossroads. How we address COVID-19 will define our future,"" he said.
Duterte said coordination of plans and courses of action between member states is vital while each country fights the pandemic with its own strategy since ""COVID-19 knows no border.""He welcomed the launch of UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, which is UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' project designed to aid low and middle-income countries to overcome the health and development crisis caused by the pandemic and support those severely affected by the economic toll and social disruption it caused.

MANILA — The Philippines is negotiating for 10 million jabs against the novel coronavirus from Johnson & Johnson, an official leading the inoculation drive said on Tuesday, as the country raced to secure vaccine doses.
The J&J vaccine requires a single shot, making the logistics of its distribution ""uncomplicated,"" said Carlito Galvez, Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.Washington may authorize the US-developed vaccine for emergency use in ""2 weeks or 3 weeks from now"", and supply may arrive in the Philippines in the third quarter of this year, said Galvez, who is also the Philippines' vaccine czar.
""Sumulat po ako sa management na taasan pa ang quota natin to 10 million,"" he said in a briefing.(I wrote to the management to increase our quota to million doses.)
The J&J vaccine is in late-stage trials as a single dose, in contrast to 2-shot vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which were also developed in the US.
The Philippines hopes to vaccinate up to 70 million people this year, starting February.
The country's first vaccine doses will likely come from Pfizer, UK's AstraZeneca, or Chinese firm Sinovac, Galvez said.So far, the Philippines has secured 30 million shots from the Serum Institute of India, 25 million from Sinovac, 20 million from Moderna, 17 million from AstraZeneca, and 40 million from the Covax Facility.
The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authority only for Pfizer's vaccine candidate, as of Tuesday.

Jean-Christophe Verhaegen, AFPMANILA — The World Health Organization on Tuesday said the Philippines already received a side letter from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Pfizer and that minor details are just being finalized in order for the country to receive its much-needed vaccines.
Pfizer’s vaccines through the COVAX Facility, of which WHO is a member, were supposed to be the first to arrive in the Philippines this month but the shipment was delayed due to the required indemnification agreement. The delay pushed back the scheduled immunization for health workers, who are being prioritized by the government.
Besides the need for an indemnification law or deal, “there are some several minor clauses” mentioned in a side letter sent by Pfizer to the Philippine government on Tuesday morning, according to WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.
“So we believe that within the day today or tomorrow, or whenever the legal teams (finalize) those documents, we will see a resolution of that impasse, and maybe there'll be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe told reporters.
Pfizer vaccine, wala pang tiyak na petsa ng pagdating sa bansa: Roque
Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is the first to receive an emergency use approval by the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration, followed by AstraZeneca and Sinovac.
Abeyasinghe previously said that besides the indemnification deal with COVAX, Pfizer is requiring a separate agreement for all countries ordering their vaccines through the COVAX Facility. He attributed the delay to Pfizer and not the Philippines.

He said that while the Philippines fulfilled all of its commitments to the COVAX Facility, which aims to give low and middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, “there have been some delays in finalizing the commitments between Pfizer-BioNtech, the manufacturer, and the Philippine government.”
“And we believe that the, that limited quantity of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines will be shipped as early as possible,” he said, “once these required exchange of letters is completed, and the requirements are met by the Philippine government and the manufacturer of the vaccine Pfizer-BioNtech.”Abeyasinghe clarified that all countries receiving COVID-19 vaccines are required to sign indemnification agreements with COVAX or directly with the manufacturers.
“The indemnification requirement is because the vaccines that are being rolled out are emergency use listed vaccines and the manufacturers cannot take responsibility for rare adverse events that may occur in, say, one in a million or one in ten million people. And so they require protection,” he said when asked if the Philippines was required to sign an indemnification agreement only because of the so-called dengvaxia controversy that happened a few years ago.
The WHO official said the requirements are “common to all countries"" and are ""not specific to the Philippines.""""They are not related to any issue that happened in the country, relating to the vaccine, or anything else,” he said.
Abeyasinghe said a delayed rollout of vaccines will continue to put at risk those most vulnerable to COVID-19 and those most likely to die from severe illness.
“I believe that everybody is doing everything possible within their remit of responsibility to fast track vaccines deliveries to countries. So, I'm not sure what more we can do,” he said, adding that delays in the inoculation drive against COVID-19 are also happening in other countries.
The Philippines on Tuesday has reported a total of 564,865 COVID-19 cases, of which, 29,817 are active infections. The death toll stands at 12,107.
Aside from Pfizer's, donated vaccines from China's Sinovac are being expected this month by the Philippine government.

MANILA — A hold-up in the processing of some documents has pushed back the arrival of US-based Pfizer'scoronavirus shots in the Philippines, an official leading the country's pandemic response said on Thursday.
The first batch of 117,000 COVID-19 shots from Pfizer will come from the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to vaccines.""Iyong ating first 117,000 na Pfizer vaccines, nagkaroon ng kaunting delay dahil sa processing ng mga dokumento with the COVAX facility and the World Health Organization,"" said Vince Dizon, deputy chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.(Our first 117,000 Pfizer vaccines met some delay because of the processing of documents.)
Dizon declined to say which documents were delayed.“Pero we were assured na tinatapos na ito (this is being finalized) as we speak,” he told reporters in an online briefing.
The Philippines has yet to receive a tentative date when the Pfizer shots will arrive, said Palace spokesman Harry Roque. In contrast, 600,000 donated COVID-19 shots from China's Sinovac will be delivered to the Philippines on Feb. 23, he said.
Pfizer's vaccine has emergency use authorization in the Philippines. Sinovac does not.""Inaasahan po natin, hindi matatapos ang buwan ng Pebrero at darating din ang paunang shipment galing sa COVAX Facility,"" Roque said in online briefing.
(We expect that February will not end without an initial shipment from the COVAX Facility.)""There's still this possibility na baka naman, harinawa, mauna pa rin ang Pfizer itong third week,"" he added.(There is still a possibility, God willing, that Pfizer might arrive first in the third week of February.)

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte's Cabinet members are willing to take COVID-19 vaccines in public to boost the Filipinos' confidence in the government’s immunization program, Cabinet Sec. Karlo Nograles said Thursday.
But Nograles clarified that government officials are not included in the list of individuals who will be the first in line to take COVID-19 vaccines.

Duterte initially said he will be the first to be inoculated in the Philippines in public, to prove the vaccine that will be distributed to Filipinos will be safe.

Dado Ruvic, Reuters/FileMANILA — The Philippines has completed all requirements for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines being supplied by the COVAX Facility, a World Health Organization official said on Tuesday.
The COVAX Facility, of which WHO is a member, is an initiative that aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
“I also want to update you that the Philippines has met all the requirements necessary for accessing the AstraZeneca vaccines,” WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said during a briefing with the Department of Health.
He confirmed around 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, which the Philippine drug regulator already approved for emergency use, have been earmarked for the country.

The government and the WHO previously said that the Philippines is set to receive AstraZeneca vaccines within the first quarter of the year.
Only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have been included in the WHO’s emergency use listing, making it easier for member countries to approve the said companies’ COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use.

“What we are now looking at is accelerating delivery of those AstraZeneca vaccines, at least a part of that shipment to the Philippines,” Abeyasinghe said.
He said Philippine officials have already signed the indemnification agreement with COVAX for the AstraZeneca vaccines.
“I understand that the Department of Health has supplied all the letters necessary to the COVAX initiative to access the early rollout of those AstraZeneca vaccines,” he said.
Unlike Pfizer, which required a separate indemnification deal with its recipient countries, Abeyasinghe said, “my understanding is that there is no requirement in the case of AstraZeneca for further exchange of letters between the manufacturer and the Philippine government.”
“We are optimistic that before the end of this week, we will hear from the COVAX initiative on likely delivery dates for AstraZeneca vaccines to the Philippines,” he said.
Asked if the Philippines is affected by the report that AstraZeneca is no longer taking additional vaccine orders, the WHO official said the Philippines’ vaccines from the COVAX Facility should not be affected.
He explained that AstraZeneca’s facility in South Korea is dedicated to exclusively manufacturing the COVAX Facility’s vaccine requirements while other countries are relying on the company’s facilities in Europe and in India.
“And what is earmarked for the Philippines will be coming from South Korea. So, we still remain optimistic that we will receive the AstraZeneca vaccines within the timeframes that we were talking about,” he said.
The Philippines was supposed to receive vaccines from Pfizer through the COVAX Facility this month. But it was delayed due to the company’s requirement for a separate indemnification agreement.
The delay pushed back the scheduled immunization for health workers, who are being prioritized by the government.
The Philippines has so far recorded 564,865 confirmed COVID-19 cases, of which, 29,817 are currently battling the disease.

OCTA researchers flag infections spike in Pasay
MANILA—The COVID-19 positivity rate in Metro Manila is rising steadily as daily coronavirus cases continue to increase, too, analysts said Friday, sounding the alarm on a possible ""overwhelming"" surge of infections in the National Capital Region (NCR).
The OCTA Research Group said in a report that the number of new COVID-19 cases in the NCR continued to increase, as it tallied over 900 new infections per day from February 26 to March 4. According to the analysts, the ratio of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the region increased to an average of 7 percent over the past 7 days and has risen by 1-percentage point every week.
In Pasay City alone, the group noted 150 new COVID-19 cases were logged from February 26 to March 4, the ""highest average daily new cases"" there. Besides Pasay, other cities in Metro Manila recorded ""marginal"" increase in coronavirus infections, the OCTA said.
""Based on our analysis of the data and the past trends in the NCR, we believe that a surge in its early stages has already started in some LGUs in the region,"" the research group said.
""Unlike past surges experienced, the current surge has spread very quickly in a short period. The increase in cases and the reproduction number indicates that the virus is already spreading exponentially in several LGUs in the region.
The single-day tally of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines reached 3,045 Friday, the highest since October 16, 2020. Analysts have been pointing out that cases in some areas of Metro Manila and Region 7 continue to increase.
Philippines logs 3,045 more COVID-19 cases, highest since October
The OCTA believes the surge of cases in Metro Manila could have been caused by the COVID-19 variants that have entered the country, including the UK and South African strains, which can overwhelm the region if ignored.

Gov't targets ‘fast containment’ of South African variant in PH
""It is important to stress the urgency of the situation as the UK and South African variants, which have already been identified in the NCR, are game-changing variants because they are more contagious and lethal and can potentially undermine our vaccination program,"" the analysts stressed.
""The priority now is to contain or mitigate the spread of these more contagious and lethal variants apart from preventing the surge in the region from becoming full-blown.""
WATCH: PH daily COVID-19 cases hit record high in 5 months amid vaccination drive
While the surge in the NCR is a serious problem, it can be abated or even reversed if it is addressed by national and local government officials, private sector and the public, the OCTA said.
""To achieve this, we need to act as one and we need to act now while the situation in the region is still manageable,"" the group emphasized, urging national government and local government officials in Metro Manila to further intensify efforts and expand COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, isolation, and localized lockdowns to curb the transmission of the deadly disease.
The cities of Cebu, Lapu Lapu, Mandaue, Davao, Baguio and Bacoor were also exhorted to do the same due to their number of daily COVID-19 cases.
""Furthermore, in the identified NCR LGUs, the implementation of more effective localized lockdowns with stricter border controls are urgently needed to suppress further viral transmissions. Effective and more stringent border controls must be observed to mitigate
COVID-19 transmissions from the NCR and between provinces and prevent the spread of the virus,"" OCTA said.
Regulations for int'l travelers must be re-evaluated
The researchers believe the surge in COVID-19 cases in the affected cities was caused by community transmission, likely aggravated by relaxation of crowd and border controls, contact tracing and coronavirus testing.
""Furthermore, some citizens' deteriorating compliance with the minimum health standard due to pandemic fatigue and/or the failure of LGUs to monitor and enforce GCQ (general community quarantine) regulations have also contributed to spikes, especially in metropolitan areas,"" the analysts said, stressing the importance of discipline in observing minimum health standards set by government.
""We also exhort the national and local governments to strictly monitor and enforce compliance with minimum health standards, such as physical distancing, wearing of face mask and face shields and proper hygiene, and to discourage large gatherings to reverse the increase in transmissions at the community level.""
The OCTA called on national government to enhance the capacity of the Philippine healthcare system, such as boosting manpower, increasing hospital equipment, and building more isolation facilities as the country sets to further reopen its economy and relax more restrictions placed to contain COVID-19 transmission.
The group also recommended government's re-evaluation of protocols for international travelers entering the Philippines.
""While we recognize the need to lift the travel ban and allow returning overseas Filipinos (ROFs) and foreign travelers to travel to the country, it is also apparent that there has been some level of ineffectiveness in the implementation of these protocols, or that perhaps we need to recalibrate some of our guidelines for the testing and quarantine of International travelers,"" the analysts advised.
""The fact that SARS-Cov2 variants of foreign origin have entered our country supports this call for stricter guidelines and/or stricter implementation of the existing guidelines.""
The OCTA spurred health workers and other frontliners in Metro Manila and other regions to get vaccinated against the infectious pathogen, as the group projects another surge of COVID-19 cases in the next few weeks.
The Philippines began its vaccination rollout on Monday after receiving its first supply of COVID-19 vaccines, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 doses from Beijing-based drugmaker Sinovac Biotech, on Sunday.

MANILA - Senators on Monday urged the officials in charge of the Philippines' COVID-19 inoculation program to allow private firms to have a say which vaccine brand they want to procure.
Local governments and private companies should ""at least authorize to be able to negotiate,"" Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said during the Senate Committee of the Whole investigation on COVID-19 vaccines.
""Right now, even the private sector would want to deal with the manufacturer and, for some reason or another, the manufacturer would want to deal with them, they cannot do so,"" he said.
""Their hands are tied by this regulatory roadblock,"" he said.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said private companies are unauthorized to procure vaccines that have yet to be certified.
So far, only emergency use authorizations have been issued to different COVID-19 vaccines brand since there is an urgent need for the vials, the agency said.

Private companies should also be allowed to hold their own vaccination programs, Sen. Francis ""Kiko"" Pangilinan said.
""Provide them the means, enable them and monitor them. Have them provide reports about the immunization,"" he said.
""Strengthen your regulation but don't prohibit the private sector,"" he said.
COVID-19 vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said the government will spend P82.5 billion to buy 148 million COVID-19 vaccine doses.
Several private firms have already partnered with the national government to procure some vaccines for their employees.

MANILA - Manila is mulling using churches as sites to provide COVID-19 jabs, its mayor said Friday, in hopes of a rapid rollout of vaccines.

Pabillo, in separate interview with Teleradyo, said they were willing to allow the city government to use their facilities as COVID-19 vaccination sites.
""Siguro kailangan nila malalaking simbahan so maghahanap kami. Kung ano 'yong mga kinakailangan nilang facilities at kung saang area,” he said.
(Maybe they will need a large church so we will look for one. What facilities they will use and which area.)
Pabillo said Manila churches had other facilities such as gyms and halls. Church staff members can also help secure the vaccination sites, he added.
Moreno said they aim to inoculate a maximum of 1,000 residents from 18 vaccination sites they had already identified.Medical frontliners, older people and teachers are among those who will be prioritized, he added.
The city mayor bared that some 76,000 residents had already pre-registered for the vaccine program. They would receive the anti-coronavirus jabs after the priority sector.Manila City has secured 800,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine from British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, which will be enough to inoculate 400,000 people.
To increase vaccine confidence, Moreno said he would fulfill his promise of getting the COVID-19 shots in public.

MANILA — An official leading the country's COVID-19 vaccination strategy apologized on Friday for the delay in the arrival of vaccines, as the Philippines lagged behind some of its regional neighbors that have already launched their respective inoculation drives.While mayors in Metro Manila have presented their own inoculation plans, the Philippines has not yet received any vaccine shipment.

I apologize because we don't control our supply chain for the vaccines.)
“Sana po maintindihan n’yo po ang kalagayan ng gobyerno.

Galvez, a former general, earlier said the absence of an indemnification program has delayed delivery of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech shots allocated to the Philippines through the vaccine sharing platform COVAX Facility.
The government had planned to use those, which were due to arrive in mid-February, to kick off its vaccination campaign.
PH still has to sign separate indemnity deal with Pfizer for its COVID-19 vaccine, says WHO
Malacañang this week said a separate shipment of 600,000 doses from China's Sinovac Biotech might be delayed due to its lack of an emergency use authorization in the Philippines.
“Minsan, ako po'y nahihiya dahil sabi nga, bakuna na lang ang kulang. Nasaan na iyong bakuna? Iyon ang question po sa atin ngayon,” said Galvez.(Sometimes, I am ashamed because as some say, everything is ready, we just lack the vaccines. Where are the vaccines? That's the question to us.)
“Bilang the leading person to really procure and manage and get the best vaccine for all of us, nakita natin na talagang medyo nahuli tayo nang kaunti.”(As the leading person to really procure and manage and get the best vaccine for all of us, we saw that we have lagged a bit.)

Galvez said 10 countries account for about 75 percent of 190 million global vaccinations, which he attributed to ""geopolitics.""He also notes that even Australia, which had excess vaccine orders, had yet to start its inoculation drive, while Japan has just started.
The Philippines' negotiation with the COVAX Facility is ""ongoing,"" he said.“We are hopeful na iyong COVAX, they will fulfill their commitment to bring us the 44 million doses,” said Galvez.“Dapat intindihin din natin sila, na iyong pagbabakuna ng buong mundo, isang malaking hamon din sa kanila,”
(We should also understand them because the global vaccination is a big challenge to them.)
Philippine officials will visit the Serum Institute of India that will produce 2 to 3 billion vaccine doses, including 30 million Novavax shots for the Philippines, he said.“Sa awa po ng Diyos, siguro po tingnan po natin, baka po meron ding umabot na vaccine this coming February and majority of our vaccine, baka magdating po ng March,” Galvez said.(God willing, let's see, perhaps a vaccine will arrive this February, and majority of our vaccines might arrive in March.)
“Iyon ina-advise ko po sa ating mga kababayan, na sana kaunting pasensya pa,” he added.
(This is my advice to our compatriots, I hope they could have a little more patience.)
Further delays in the vaccination drive could derail economic recovery after the country's worst contraction on record last year, when it slumped 9.5 percent, the biggest decline in Southeast Asia.

Panfilo Lacson on Tuesday said the Philippines' slow procurement of COVID-19 vaccines is ""embarrassing"" as the country still continues to study which brand should be procured, while other nations have either begun mass inoculations or are awaiting delivery.
Other countries have already purchased COVID-19 vaccines while the Philippines has yet to place an actual order for the drug, Lacson said in an interview on TeleRadyo.

(The government looks embarrassing... How many loans have we gotten for the vaccine? Why don't we have the vaccines up to now?)
The Philippines' 2.5 million doses from AstraZeneca was made possible because the private sector helped fund the deal provided that their employees would get half of the procured shots, Lacson said.

It is the first set of results of Sinovac's Phase 3 global trials, which are also being conducted in Turkey and Indonesia.
Vaccines are considered essential to curb the rampaging virus, which has killed over 1 million people globally.
Experts have warned that the safety of inactivated coronavirus vaccine candidates should be observed over longer periods, as some other inactivated vaccines had led to disease enhancement effect, where vaccine-triggered antibodies, instead of offering protection, could worsen infections when people became exposed to a virus after inoculation.
Sinovac, a Beijing-based company, said more than 10,000 people in Beijing had been injected with its vaccine. Separately, it said nearly all its employees — around 3,000 in total — and their families had taken it.

MANILA - A public health expert on Tuesday said President Rodrigo Duterte should be ""given a script"" regarding vaccine development during his public briefings in order to avoid confusion amid growing expectations of a COVID-19 vaccine within the year.
Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, urged Filipinos to listen to experts about the process of making a vaccine, saying it is a complex undertaking that may take years to ensure its safety and efficacy.
""Nagkaroon ng meeting sa DOH (Department of Health), 'yun din ang sinabi ko, sana nga bigyan na lang natin ng script ang Pangulo tungkol sa mga ganitong vaccine development. Hindi madaling intindihin 'yung vaccine development,"" she told Teleradyo's ""SRO"".
Duterte prefers COVID-19 vaccines from China, Russia
Bravo's appeal came a day after Duterte said his administration would prioritize potential COVID-19 vaccines made by drugmakers from China and Russia.
She said that a non-expert's explanation on such topic may only sow confusion.
""Kasi nga mahirap i-explain. Sabi nga ng iba, 'pag pinag-uusapan na 'yang tungkol sa mga mikrobyo, sa germs, paano gagawa ng bakuna, ay talagang duduguin ka. Kasi mahirap isipin kung paano gagawain 'yan,"" she said.
Bravo, who has been doing vaccine trials in the country for decades, also offered her group's expertise to the President.
""Kaya 'pag minsan 'pag medyo nagkamali ka ng nasabi mo, nako-confuse ang tao. Sabi nga natin, mas mabuti ang nage-explain sa atin ay 'yun talagang eksperto at gumagawa ng vaccine trial kasi kung hindi ka eksperto at hindi gumagawa ng vaccine trial, minsan medyo namamali 'yung nasasabi mo,"" she said.

Laboratories around the world are racing to find a vaccine to rein in COVID-19, which has infected almost 30 million people and killed more than 929,000, according to a running tally from Johns Hopkins University.
The World Health Organization said in early September that 34 vaccine candidates worldwide are currently in the various phases of being tested on humans, while a further 142 are in pre-clinical evaluation.
To date, the Philippines has recorded 269,407 coronavirus infections, with 57,392 active cases. The tally also includes 4,663 people who succumbed to the disease while 207,352 were declared to have recovered.

MAYNILA - Naghahanda na ang bansa sa pagdating at pag-rollout ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 sa kalagitnaan ng buwan. Pero marami pa ring Pilipino ang may alinlangan hinggil sa bakuna at posibleng maging epekto nito sa kanila.
Sa panayam ng TeleRadyo, Miyerkoles ng umaga, kay Dr. Rommel Crisenio Lobo, vice chair ng National Adverse Events Following Immunization Committee, sinagot niya ang ilang katanungan hinggil sa pagbabakuna kontra COVID-19.
Palace says Philippines ready to start COVID-19 vaccinations next week
ANO ANG DAPAT ASAHAN MATAPOS MAGPABAKUNA?
Ayon kay Lobo, may mga taong walang nararamdamang reaksiyon matapos mabakunahan. Mayroon namang iba na nagkakaroon ng reaksiyon, pero ito ay normal lang, aniya.
“Meron pong iba, nakakaramdam ng pananakit o pamamaga sa injection site o pamumula. Normal reaction po yun. Ibig sabihin, yung bakuna, maganda ang uptake sa katawan natin, na-recognize ng ating immune system. Meron pong iba, nilalagnat o inaantok. Pero, kadalasan, maa-address po 'yun sa pagbigay ng paracetamol sa lagnat at pananakit. Tapos, after 2 or 3 days, mawawala po siyang mag-isa,” sabi ni Lobo.
Pwede ring lagyan ng ice compress ang injection site para mabawasan ang pananakit at pamamaga.
PUWEDE BANG UMINOM NG GAMOT BILANG PAGHAHANDA BAGO MABAKUNAHAN?
Ayon kay Lobo, hindi inirerekomenda ang pre-medication o ang pag-inom ng gamot, tulad ng anti-allergy, bago magpabakuna.
“Kadalasan po kasi, baka mangyari, ma-delay yung reaction. Inoobserbahan sila for 30 minutes, baka po walang makita; tapos pagdating sa bahay, meron. Kaya po, mas maganda, wala po silang ininom na gamot para po kita yung reaction, kung meron,” saad niya.
Magkakaroon rin naman ng screening sa mga taong babakunahan kung saan kukunin ang kanilang vital signs at magsasagawa rin ng counseling.
“Tatanungin kayo kung meron kayong reaction previously, mga gamot na iniinom para malaman din kung merong posibilidad na magkaroon ng cross reaction sa mga sinasabing gamot o sa bakuna,” sabi niya.

GAANO KATAGAL DAPAT OBSERBAHAN MATAPOS MABAKUNAHAN?
Matapos mabakunahan, hinikayat ni Lobo ang mga pasyente na huwag magmadaling umuwi.
“Kadalasan po, 30 minutes will be sufficient kasi po yung mga nagkakaroon ng allergic reaction, yung severe allergic reaction na sinasabi natin na anaphylaxis doon po sa isang Brighton Collaboration study, nakita po nila na almost 70 percent ng magkakaroon ng severe allergic reaction, nakikita po within 15 minutes. Tapos umaabot po ng 80 to 85 percent pagkabago po mag-30 minutes. Kaya mas safe po yung 30 minutes na observation period,” paliwanag niya.
PAANO MASASABI NA ANG ADVERSE EVENT AY SA BAKUNA O SA IBANG FACTOR GALING?
Sabi ni Lobo, kadalasang nagkakaroon sila ng investigation for causality.
“Tinitingnan natin po yung relasyon, yung paglabas ng sinasabing kino-complain nila at saka mga oras kung kailan lumabas yun, at saka kung expected po na reaction sa mga bakunang ibinibigay,” ani Lobo.
Kailangan maibestigahan muna umano ito bago mag-deklara na mayroong causality, na may kinalaman ang kanilang naranasang reaksiyon sa bakuna.
“Yun po ay pinagmimitingan din ng mga imbestigador para po magkaroon ng 100 porsiyento na may basehan sa siyensa, na doon nga galing sa bakuna yun o hindi,” dagdag niya.
Sakaling makaranas ng adverse reaction, tulad ng hirap sa paghinga, at naimbestigahan na ito ay galing sa bakuna, ang pasyente ay hindi na maaaring mabigyan ng ikalawang dose ng bakuna.
Mayroon ring protocol na susundin para sa mga pasyenteng magkakaroon ng severe allergic reaction.
“Meron pong mga gamot na ini-inject sa inyo para hindi na mag-progress (ang) reaction n'yo; at the same time, mahinto po siya,” sabi niya.
Ipinaalala niya na ang ibinibigay ng pamahalaan ng emergency use authorization sa mga bakuna ay hindi lisensiya para sa pagbenta sa mga vaccine. Ito ay pagtitiyak lang din na ang bakunang ibibigay sa mga Pilipino ay ligtas, epektibo at libre.

OBSERBAHAN MUNA MGA NABAKUNAHAN
Ginagawa aniya nila ang information campaign para iparating sa publiko na ligtas ang bakuna at maialis ang kanilang agam-agam kaugnay dito.
Kahit pa mahigpit na sinusunod ang pagsuot ng face mask, face shield, paghuhugas ng kamay at physical distancing, ang mga minimum health protocols na ito ay nagpapabagal lamang sa pagkalat ng COVID-19, pero hindi tuluyang nakapipigil sa virus.
“Pagka sinama ang bakuna doon, at maraming tao ang nabakunahan, doon lang po makakabangon ang ating ekonomiya at saka makakatulong po sa atin bawat isa,” sabi niya.
Para mapawi ang agam-agam ng marami tungkol sa pagpapabakuna, lalo na ang may mga iniindang sakit o may mga allergy, mas mainam na kumonsulta muna sa kanilang mga doktor o mga espesyalista tulad ng allergists.
Iniimbitahan ni Lobo ang publiko na tumutok sa kanilang Facebook Live kung saan tatalakayin ang allergies at COVID-19 vaccines ngayong Huwebes, Pebrero 11, alas-9 ng umaga.
“Mag-o-open to questions po 'yan at sasagutin namin mga katanungan nila,” sabi niya.

Metro Manila, home to roughly a tenth of the Philippines' 100 million population, accounts for a third of the country's gross domestic product while neighboring Southern Tagalog region serves as home to several economic zones and industrial plants.
The Philippines fell into recession following a steep contraction in second quarter GDP due to the impact of COVID-19 and resulting lockdowns.Metro Manila, Rizal, Bulacan, Cavite and Laguna are back under modified enhanced community quarantine until Aug. 18 following an appeal from medical frontliners for ""breathing space"" due to a spike in COVID-19 cases.

Under the indemnity deal, the national government will be responsible and shoulder the cost for adverse effects on those inoculated, NTF deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said.

Such a deal is standard requirement for vaccine manufacturers, Dizon said.

“They submitted an application this morning and pre-evaluation is going on,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo told ABS-CBN News.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said during Thursday’s Laging Handa briefing that Bharat Biotech vaccine is one of those being considered for procurement by the Philippine government. But he said they have yet to see the results of its clinical trials.
The EUA application was also confirmed by IP Biotech and Ambica International, which have an exclusive agreement with Bharat Biotech to distribute the so-called COVAXIN vaccine in the Philippines.
According to the group, COVAXIN was developed by Bharat in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Virology.“The indigenous, inactivated, whole virus vaccine has a standard cold chain temperature of 2-8 degrees Celsius, making it ideal for tropical countries,” IP Biotech said in its statement, adding that traditional inactivated vaccines are seen as a “safe and proven” based on long-term studies.
According to the group, the Philippines is on its list of priority countries for the COVAXIN supply and that the Indian government itself earlier issued a letter mentioning this.
IP Biotech said Bharat has over 140 current, fully registered and licensed globally-patented vaccines and biotherapeutics, a number of which are approved and available in the Philippines. Among the most prominent, according to the group, is the IndiRab rabies vaccine. Bharat biotech also has vaccines on rotavirus, typhoid and polio.
Based on the World Health Organization’s draft vaccine landscape document, COVAXIN comes in 2 doses.
An Associated Press report recently cited Bharat Biotech advising those with weak immunity, allergies and bleeding disorder to not take the vaccine. The report said Bharat Biotech was involved in controversy after the Indian government allowed its use without an efficacy rate.The company said it will release its efficacy data by March.
Previous reports said the company plans to produce 700 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine this year.
India's Bharat Biotech aims to make 700 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine in 2021
The Philippines' FDA has so far granted EUA only to Pfizer's vaccine candidate against the coronavirus.
It continues to assess the EUA application of AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Institute, and Sinovac for their respective vaccine products.
The government hopes to inoculate up to 70 million of the country's population to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19. Vaccine supplies are expected to start arriving next month.
On Wednesday, the COVID-19 death toll in the Philippines breached the 10,000-mark, as the cumulative total of infections soared to 505,939. Active cases stood at 28,904.

MANILA - A former health secretary on Wednesday expressed concern on the high levels of hesitancy towards getting COVID-19 shots in Metro Manila, saying this could affect the country's efforts to stem the pandemic.
""I think that the data is very alarming. This 75 percent vaccine hesitancy is way dangerous... and we need to do something about it,"" Dr. Esperanza Cabral told ANC.
Citing previous data, vaccine hesitancy in the country only ranged between 40 to 60 percent, she said.
If three-quarters of the population in the Philippine capital are wary of the inoculation, this is a ""big, dangerous leap,"" Cabral added.
Only 1 in 4 Metro Manila residents willing to take COVID-19 vaccine — OCTA survey
In a non-commissioned scientific poll conducted by a group of experts in December, only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Some 47 percent of respondents were undecided while 28 percent said they would not get the coronavirus vaccine, the OCTA Research Team survey revealed.
To address this seeming widespread hesitancy, Cabral said health authorities should conduct massive information campaign.
""We need to make them understand that vaccines are effective and safe. And that if they take it, the chances of developing this dreaded coronavirus illness are going to be reduced by very significant number,"" she said.
""We need to make sure that we reach everybody with the correct information so that they can choose for themselves whether they will accept the vaccine or not.""
As parts of the world began rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, with priority given to health-care workers, Cabral urged the Philippine government to focus on the execution of the planned nationwide COVID-19 vaccination.
""As far as the roadmap is concerned, I think that the roadmap is basically good. It follows the roadmap of many other countries and the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO),"" she said.
""It is just the execution of the roadmap that we need to look into. We're always being praised for having nice implementation programs and plans but when it comes to the execution, that is sometimes where we fail.""
A year into the pandemic, the Philippines has logged nearly 480,000 coronavirus infections, of which 9,300 have died from the illness, among the highest in the Southeast Asian region.

“Nag-announce na po ang WHO na mag-uumpisa ang trials by December 2020. So sa November kasi mag-uumpisa sila sa isang site na uumpisahan then magfo-follow na po ang iba’t ibang clinical trials in other countries including the Philippines,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a virtual briefing.
(The WHO announced that the trials will start in December 2020. So in November it will start in one site first then it will be followed by clinical trials in other countries including the Philippines.)
The Solidarity Trial for vaccines was slated to start this month but it was repeatedly re-scheduled due to various reasons.
Vergeire said the WHO will announce the trial sites and other details this week.
As for the pharmaceutical companies dealing separately with the Philippines, Vergeire said the vaccine from Chinese company Sinovac is moving forward, following an expert panel’s approval.
She said the panel will meet with the ethics review board to discuss if the company’s application for Phase 3 clinical trials can undergo processing by the Food and Drug Administration.
While most vaccine developers plan to just market their vaccines to the Philippines, some like Sinovac are interested in holding large-scale clinical tests in the country.
Vergeire said Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, one of those interested in holding clinical trials, is already in touch with a local research organization.
“Yung sa Gamaleya yung contract research organization (CRO) nakikipagusap na sila so that the CRO would be the ones to represent them here in the country,” she said.
(For Gamaleya, they are already talking to the the contract research organization (CRO) so that the CRO would be the ones to represent them here in the country.)

MANILA — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday said the country’s vaccine expert panel recently received and is now studying the application of United Kingdom-based drug maker AstraZeneca to hold COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines.
“The vaccine expert panel is now evaluating several applications or several that signified interest (in running clinical trials in the country),” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a virtual briefing.
“Recently we accepted an application from AstraZeneca,” he added, after mentioning the other vaccine developers also interested in clinical trials in the Philippines such as Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, China’s Clover Biopharmaceuticals and European firm Janssen Pharmaceutical.Video from DOH
AstraZeneca is a British pharmaceutical company that partnered with Oxford University in developing a COVID-19 vaccine.Recent reports said the vaccine showed encouraging immune response among the elderly. It is one of the several vaccines that have already reached the Phase 3 process for vaccine development.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire during the same briefing told media that she and Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the Philippines’ designated vaccine czar and chief implementer of the country's national policy against COVID-19, met with AstraZeneca recently.
“They have that intention,” she said. “Sa ganyan magandang indikasyon 'yan kasi gusto ng Philippine government na talagang mai-try out muna sa ating mga Pilipino bago natin umpisahan ang pagbabakuna sa ating kababayan,” she said.
(That is a good indication because the Philippine government wants to have vaccines tested first among Filipinos before it is distributed to many.)
Domingo said only Chinese company Sinovac has finished the pre-evaluation process of the vaccine expert panel and is now officially lodged with the FDA.
“Mukhang konting documentation na lang 'yung kulang (ng Sinovac) para ma-complete ang requirements ng ating regulatory reviewers and of course the ethics boards and the FDA,” he said. “Hopefully this will all be resolved soon.”
(It seems there are only a few documents remaining to complete the requirements of our regulatory reviewers and of course the ethics boards and the FDA. Hopefully this will all be resolved soon.)
If Sinovac is able to pass the FDA process, it may be the first company to hold COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines. There is still no definite date for the World Health Organization’s multi-country clinical trials, which will test several vaccines against COVID-19.
Vergeire previously explained that it is better to have clinical trials in the country to check if a vaccine is safe and effective for Filipinos. She said vaccines may have different effects on different races.

MANILA-- Barangays (villages) with the highest number of coronavirus infections will serve as the primary recruitment hub for the Philippines' clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines as the government prepares to test vaccine candidates on Filipinos.
The Philippines will prioritize vaccine trials under the World Health Organization Solidarity Trial program, the government's pandemic task force said in a resolution dated Sept. 3.
Manila has ongoing vaccine discussions with Beijing and Moscow, with Russia's COVID-19 vaccine already approved for human clinical trials in the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte even volunteered himself to be inoculated in public with the Russian drug.
Phase 3 human clinical trials are large-scale testing to check the efficacy and safety of vaccines on thousands of people. It is often the last step before a vaccine gets regulatory approval from the country.

Authorities will ""recruit"" volunteers for vaccine clinical trials from the top five villages reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases based on attack rates per 1,000-population per barangay, Science Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña said on Monday.
""Importante po ito kasi gusto nating ma-testing iyong kagalingan ng vaccine or iyong efficacy. Kaya iyon ay iti-testing natin doon sa lugar na mataas ang cases ng COVID-19,"" he said in a Palace press briefing.
(This is important because we want to test the efficacy of vaccines in areas where there are high cases of COVID-19.)
The villages with the highest number of coronavirus infections will be identified based on data from the Department of Health's Epidemiology Bureau. The said office will also manage the database on information on clinical trials once these begin.
Temporary residents are discouraged from volunteering for the clinical trials unless they could show proof that they will be staying in the area of the trial site for the next two years since participants need to be monitored after inoculation.
Trial sites will be at the barangay level, and randomization will be by households, Dela Peña said.
In the event that participants in a certain barangay are not enough, Dela Peña said the government could recruit in adjacent villages that also report high COVID-19 infections.
HOW WILL PRIVATE COMPANIES RUN VACCINE TRIALS?
Private vaccine companies that need to run human clinical trials will be assigned separate trial zones ""such that they are equally and rationally distributed to avoid competition in subject recruitment.""
In cases of outbreaks in select areas, clinical vaccine trials can be conducted in such places as long as there are facilities for the storage of vaccines, Dela Peña said.
""In that case, iyong halimbawang kulang pa rin ay puwede silang pumunta sa adjacent barangays,"" he said.
(In that case, the deficit can be fulfilled from adjacent barangays.)
For transparency purposes, the government's pandemic task force recommended a memorandum of agreement between the Department of Science and Techonology, and the Department of the Interior and Local Government.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday threw his support behind the decision of Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr., to order the COVID-19 vaccine made by Sinovac Biotech, amid criticisms about China-made vaccine's efficacy.
Duterte, in his weekly public address, said he is not forcing local government officials from getting the same vaccine brand if they have the resources to buy from other pharmaceutical companies.
""Maraming local government units who opted to go on their own. Sila ang magbili, may pera sila, at sila ang mamili ng kanilang vaccine,"" he said during his weekly public address.
(Many local governments opted to go on their own. They will use their own money to choose and buy their own vaccines.)
""We are not forcing anybody to join the cause of the national government. Hindi namin pinipilit na sumali kayo sa ibibigay na bakuna ng national government,"" Duterte added.
(We are not forcing anybody to join the cause of the national government. We are not forcing you to join the vaccination program of the national government.)
Duterte claimed Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine is just as good as those made by other manufacturers.
""The bakuna (vaccine) that Sec. Galvez is buying is as good as any other bakuna na naimbento ng mga Amerikano o ng mga Europeans (vaccine developed by the Americans or Europeans),"" he said.
""Hindi nagkulang ang Chinese, hindi sila nagkulang sa utak. Bright itong mga Intsik and they would not venture kung hindi sapat, if it is not safe, sure and secure... That is the guarantee,"" Duterte said.
(The Chinese are good. They are bright enough not to venture into something if it is not safe, sure and secure. That is the guarantee.""
However, the coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac only showed a ""general efficacy"" of 50.4 percent in a late-stage trial in Brazil, the company's local partners said on Tuesday.
Piecemeal disclosure from global studies of the vaccine, called CoronaVac, have added to concerns that immunizations developed by Chinese producers are not subject to the same public scrutiny as US and European alternatives.

According to data from Senator Sonny Angara's office, two doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Sinovac are priced at P3,629, making it the second most expensive vaccine next to Moderna, which is priced at P3,904 to P4,504 for two doses.
Meanwhile, two doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine only cost P610.
Most local government units, including Duterte's hometown Davao City, ordered the COVID-19 vaccine made by AstraZeneca.

RESPONSIBILITY
Duterte said he supports Galvez and whatever decision the latter makes is as good as his.
""Ako, kung ano ang piliin ni Sec. Galvez, would bind me. Parang ako na rin ang bumili ng bakuna. So hindi ako magbili ng bakuna na hindi tama,"" he said.
(I am bound by Sec. Galvez's choice. It's like I am the one who bought the vaccines, so I will not buy something that is not right.)
""Ultimately, actually, sa lahat ng ito, kung may bulilyaso, 'yung amin sa gobyerno na pinili at nine-negotiate ngayon, kung may bulilyaso, at the end of the day, akin talaga 'yang responsibilidad,"" Duterte added.
(Ultimately, actually, at the end of everything, of there will be a problem, at the end of the day, it will be my responsibility.)
Duterte also told local government officials that although they have the freedom to choose which brand of vaccine to buy, there are still laws to follow.
""I'm now addressing myself to the mayors, governors. You can choose any vaccine you like to buy. Wala kaming pakialam kung ano ang pipiliin ninyo. Hindi kami makiaalam sa lahat ng bagay in the purchase,"" he said.
(I'm now addressing myself to the mayors, governors. You can choose any vaccine you like to buy. We will not meddle in your choice. We will not interfere in the process of purchasing the vaccines.)
""Alam ninyo kasi may batas tayo na lahat ng medisina, whatever nature and whatever be its characteristics, magdaan talaga muna ng pagsilip sa gobyerno. Ang gobyerno kasi ang last eh. Ang gobyerno kasi ang babagsak dito, after sa bakuna ng iba tapos may babagsak na 5,000 Filipino, ililibing ako dito,"" Duterte added.
(We have laws that all medicines, whatever their nature or characteristics may be, it should first be checked by the government. The government will ultimately be affected. If 5,000 Filipinos suffer from the vaccines, I will be buried.)
Duterte also claimed that the Philippines is at the tail-end of the vaccine supply chain since other countries have already secured their own supply.
""Wala pa ang supply natin, ginagawa pa (They are still manufacturing the supply for us),"" he said.
Galvez earlier said the government will sign a supply deal for 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from British drug group AstraZeneca.

Authorities, he said, recently secured 30 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine Covovax from Serum Institute of India (SII), which only needs to be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.SII partnered with U.S.-based Novavax Inc for the development and commercialization of Covovax, which is in third-stage trials and expected to be approved for use by international regulators, Faberco said.
The vaccine will be available locally by the third quarter of 2021 and will be used to inoculate 15 million vulnerable and poor Filipinos, it said.
Galvez has said the Philippines was negotiating with seven vaccine manufacturers to procure at least 148 million COVID-19 shots as it seeks to inoculate close to two-thirds of its population this year, said Carlito Galvez, a former military general in charge of the Philippines' strategy to fight the coronavirus.Manila is hoping to close similar deals with Moderna , AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson , Sinovac Biotech and the Gamaleya Institute this month.

A more contagious COVID-19 variant first spotted in Britain has spread across the globe, according to the World Health Organization.
Another variant, detected initially in South Africa, has raised greater alarm among researchers over its possible impact on immunity.
The coronavirus has killed more than 2.2 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to an AFP tally based on official sources.
More than 100 million vaccines have meanwhile been given around the world but none of the world's 29 poorest countries has formally started mass inoculations.
Separately on Wednesday, GSK revealed that net profits soared by almost a quarter last year on the back of divestments.
Profit after taxation jumped 24 percent to £5.7 billion ($7.8 billion, 6.5 billion euros) in 2020 from a year earlier, GSK said in a results statement.
Revenues however rose by just one percent to £34 billion, with vaccine sales hit as governments prioritized COVID-19 vaccines -- and more disruption expected in 2021.
""For our vaccines business, we now anticipate further disruption during the first half of the year, given governments' prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination programs and the resurgence in late 2020 of the pandemic,"" GSK noted.
""This is expected to impact adult and adolescent immunizations, including (shingles vaccine) Shingrix, notably in the United States.""

Mabilis at marami agad sapagkat ito ang makapagbibigay sa atin in the long run ng proteksiyon,” Dr. Maria Consorcia Quizon, a member of the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) for COVID-19 vaccines, said in an interview on TeleRadyo.(The most important thing that experts say is to be expedient, to speed up vaccinating many people because this will provide us protection in the long run.)

The Philippines on Monday began its vaccination program, inoculating mostly health workers using jabs donated by China’s Sinovac Biotech. A shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines, meanwhile, arrived in the Philippines on Thursday through the vaccine-sharing platform COVAX Facility.“That is what we have at the moment. Kahit lumitaw na sa Pilipinas ay may variant, ang mas nakakarami pa rin ay 'yung naunang COVID so makakaprotekta pa rin sa atin,"" she said.
(This is what we have at the moment. Even if there is a presence of a variant in the Philippines, majority is the first COVID so the vaccines can still protect us.)
Quizon said vaccine brands being rolled out around the world help protect patients and their communities from COVID-19, regardless of its efficacy rate.
None of the vaccines can say that its efficacy is 100 percent, she added, and brands whose rating is not that high can still be protective.The OCTA Research Group earlier said that the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine decreases from 70 percent to 10 percent in cases of the South African COVID-19 variant.
AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine may be ‘ineffective’ if PH fails to contain South African variant: expert
There is no vaccine that currently addresses this particular variant and the other mutations. Quizon said the vaccines that have been developed by various firms around the world were intended to address the first strain.
She emphasized that COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against the disease developing into a more severe form, helping prevent death.“Wala pa talagang makakapagsabi na one is better than the other,” she said.“Sa vaccines na meron tayo good for naunang coronavirus kaya di natin masabi kung talagang totally effective itong version na ito for that variant. Pero inaasahan natin na sooner or later magdadagdag sila o magte-tweak sila ng vaccine na 'yun para matugunan din o malabanan din itong variant na ito.”

MANILA (4th UPDATE) — More than a year since being hit with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippines on Sunday received its first official supply of vaccines that would jumpstart its inoculation drive against the coronavirus, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 shots from Beijing-based drugmaker Sinovac Biotech.A Chinese plane carrying the first batch of vaccines landed in Villamor Air Base at around 4 in the afternoon Sunday, according to state television network PTV.

President Rodrigo Duterte, his former aide Sen. Christopher ""Bong"" Go, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, national COVID-19 task chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. and other Cabinet officials formally welcomed the country's initial vaccine supply at the airbase with Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian and other Chinese diplomats.
The military will get 100,000 doses from the donation and the rest will go to select health workers of the country, which has recorded 574,247 total COVID-19 cases as of Saturday and has lagged behind its Southeast Asian neighbors in securing the vaccines.
Roque meanwhile said the Philippines should be thankful for the vaccine donation.
“Ang importante rin nating ipakita, iyong ating pasasalamat at utang na loob sa ating mga kapatid na Tsino, na sa pinakamadilim na yugto ng ating kasaysayan, nakapagbigay tulong naman ang Tsina,” said Roque.(It is important that we show our thanks and debt of gratitude to our Chinese brothers, that in the darkest chapter of our history, China gave help.)
Huang reiterated the safety and efficacy of SinoVac's CoronaVac jabs, saying they have been ""well-tested"" and used in many countries.
""I hope that the (Sinovac) vaccines will help kick off the Philippines's mass inoculation campaign to curb the pandemic and allow Filipinos to return to normal life at the earliest,"" he said in his speech at the welcome ceremony.
Huang added ""this has demonstrated China's determination to fight the pandemic in the spirit of solidarity and build a community"" with neighboring countries.The interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) on Friday announced it was recommending the administration of CoronaVac to health workers despite a 50.4 percent efficacy rate when it was given to medical frontliners exposed to COVID-19 during trials in Brazil.

MANILA - The Philippines will have access to the coronavirus vaccine of the US, Malacañang said Tuesday, after a biotech firm in its Western ally announced that its drug against the COVID-19 disease was almost 95-percent effective.The US' top infectious disease scientist on Monday hailed the coronavirus vaccine of Moderna as ""stunningly impressive"", following a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants. Last week, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech also said their vaccine was 90 percent effective.""We have firm commitments from the United States... that we will have access po to COVID vaccines that may be developed in the United States,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.He said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo relayed this information to Manila's Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin.Philippines to borrow $300 million for coronavirus vaccine: Duterte
China has promised to supply its future COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines, while the UK agreed with the World Health Organization that it would give its potential vaccine to poor countries, said Roque.
Both US vaccine frontrunners are based on new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called ""messenger RNA"" to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
""The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, which co-developed the vaccine.""It is really a spectacular result that I don't think anybody had anticipated would be this good.""
Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
The company, which has received $2 billion from the US government under ""Operation Warp Speed,"" added it is on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021.

Global infections from COVID-19 have soared past 54 million with more than 1.3 million deaths since the virus emerged in China late last year.
Moncef Slaoui, who leads Operation Warp Speed, said he hoped the 2 vaccines would be approved ""somewhere towards in the first half of December,"" with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine the next on the horizon early next year.
It is not yet clear how long-lasting the protection will be from either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. Another open question is whether they stop people who are exposed to the virus from transmitting it on to the other people, even though they may be themselves protected from the disease.

MANILA (UPDATE) — The Food and Drug Administration has granted an emergency use authorization for the COVID-19 vaccine of China's Sinovac Biotech, paving the way for its delivery to the Philippines, an official said Monday.
“After a thorough and rigorous review of the currently available published and unpublished data by our regulatory and medical experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac Life Sciences Company, known as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Vero Cell Inactivated, o yung trade name nya ay CoronaVac,"" FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
""The benefit of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risk,” he added.
Domingo said that interim data from Sinovac show the vaccine has an efficacy rate on patients aged 18 to 59 years of 65.3%, based on trials in Indonesia, and up to 91.2% based on trials done in Turkey.
“However, it has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4% when used on health care workers exposed to COVID-19. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this group,” the official said.
3 TO 5 DAYS
Before the announcement, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said during the same briefing that China’s Sinovac is the COVID-19 vaccine brand likely to arrive in the Philippines before the month ends.

“Malamang, Sinovac po yan ang posibleng dumating na 600,000 doses (Sinovac’s 600,000 doses is likely to arrive). Good for 300,000 individuals,” Duque said.He said that once the EUA is released, it will only take 3 to 5 days for the Chinese Embassy to prepare the shipment of the vaccines.
This is the third COVID-19 vaccine product that has received an EUA in the Philippines, following those developed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca.
Philippines approves Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use
PH approves AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use
Palace spokesman Harry Roque earlier said 600,000 Beijing-donated Sinovac shots would arrive on Feb. 23. He said 100,000 of these doses would go to the military, and the rest to health workers.
However, Roque later said that the lack of an EUA might delay the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines.
MILD TO MODERATE SIDE EFFECTS
Domingo said experts recommend two equal and standard doses of 0.5 mL each, given 4 weeks apart, for patients receiving Sinovac's vaccine.
“The adverse events reported were transient and mostly mild to moderate similar to common vaccine reactions,"" he said.
""No specific safety concerns were identified. But it must be noted that this only reflects limited follow-up, and more adverse effects may emerge that’s why close surveillance and monitoring is needed after the immunization,” he added.
Besides being certified Halal by Indonesia, Domingo said Sinovac is a “good option for individuals who have allergies to components of other available vaccines such as the polyethylene glycol and polysorbate.”
The 2 ingredients are said to cause anaphylaxis and severe allergies, although such effects were very rare.
Polyethylene glycol is said to be among the ingredients of mRNA vaccines like that of Pfizer’s, while polysorbate is said to be in viral vector vaccines.
Before Sinovac’s EUA was approved, the government was expecting Pfizer to send the first batch of doses through the COVAX Facility.But the shipment was delayed due to a pending indemnification agreement. The Philippine government said it already signed the agreement with COVAX, but the World Health Organization, which is a member of COVAX Facility, said it is still waiting a separate indemnification deal from Pfizer.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. previously said the delay will only take a week. There is still no update as of press time.

The FDA is currently evaluating the EUA application of Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, and awaiting documents from India’s Bharat Biotech.
Several countries, including in Asia, have already rolled out their respective COVID-19 vaccination programs.
More than 561,000 coronavirus infections have been confirmed in the Philippines, as of Sunday, including 26,238 active cases.

Naredo, ABS-CBN News",Dec 15 2020 06:10 PM,"MANILA, Philippines -- After most professional sports competitions were held in a limited capacity in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the head of the Games and Amusements Board (GAB) expects pro sports to be back with a vengeance next year.
Because of the global health crisis, professional sporting events -- as did most sport competitions -- ground to a halt for most of the year. It was only in October that pro competitions began to return, primarily in bio-secure ""bubbles"" that did not allow for fans to be physically present.
Most prominent of these events was the PBA's bubble in Clark, Pampanga. The league held only one conference in a bid to salvage its 45th season, with Barangay Ginebra emerging as champions of the Philippine Cup.

""What happened in 2020 is very unfortunate for Philippine professional sports,"" acknowledged GAB chairman Baham Mitra during the Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA) Forum on Tuesday morning.
""But we're looking at 2021 as a banner year. Merong gigil eh. Merong pagsasabik, so bulusok tayo sa 2021,"" he added.
Professional sporting events will start as early as January 2021, with chess to be played virtually. The PBA plans to open its new season in April, while professional volleyball will get underway with the Premier Volleyball League in the first or second quarter of 2021 as well.

Mitra further reported that there might be an international mixed martial event in the country by the second quarter of 2021, while a local promotion is planning a fight card in February.
""Baka sakali magkaroon tayo ng professional basketball league pa na mga bago, hindi pa natin ma-announce kung saan at kung kailan,"" he added. ""We're looking at beach volleyball to turn pro. We're also looking at pingpong turning pro.""
Women's sports will be at the forefront, especially with the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) set to hold its first pro season next year as well.
""Marami tayong magagaling na basketball players na maha-highlight dahil magpo-professional na rin po ang babaeng basketball,"" said Mitra.
As excited as he is for pro sports to get back into the swing of things, Mitra also warned that Filipino athletes, coaches, and officials must continue to stay vigilant. This, even with the welcome news that a COVID-19 vaccine is already being distributed and administered in other countries.
Mitra said GAB will continue to remind its stakeholders to stay safe and follow the health and safety protocols imposed by the government.
""We must continue to stay safe. And we at GAB will make sure that we remind them,"" said Mitra.

MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine Superliga (PSL) has partnered with the Go Negosyo program in order to acquire vaccines for its teams, league chairman Philip Ella Juico revealed.
During an appearance on ""Power and Play"" last Saturday, Juico said they have made an order for 1000 vaccines, through the Go Negosyo program of Joey Concepcion, the president of RFM Corp. and also the presidential adviser for entrepreneurship.
""Our request is being processed,"" said Juico. ""There are batches of vaccines and we are there in one of the batches.""
""Probably, if things go as planned, maybe we should have them by May or June,"" he added.
But the league already intends to open its 2021 season in February with a beach volleyball tournament, even if the players are not yet vaccinated. Juico says that while the vaccine is not yet available, the league will ""make do"" by holding the Beach Volleyball Challenge Cup in a bubble in Subic.The PSL met with local officials last week to discuss the details of the event, which was originally scheduled for November but postponed due to the typhoons that hit the country last year.
""Definitely, no spectators allowed,"" said Juico. ""The SBMA (Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority) has already prepared for a no-spectator type of arrangement and that has been the approval of the Board of Directors of the SBMA.""
The subsequent conferences, including the All-Filipino Cup, remain up in the air though Juico believes they will also take place in a bubble.
The PSL was forced to cancel its Grand Prix in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Juico says that ultimately, their plans -- including the vaccination of players -- will depend on government regulations and the COVID-19 situation in the country, particularly in the area where they plan to hold their tournaments.
""All these plans are dicey,"" he admitted. ""A lot depends on the environment, on how the numbers change in the locality, the infections and all of that, especially with this variant.""

Teodoro said that besides the city’s sports center there will be 9 other vaccination centers at schools as they target 10,000 daily inoculations.
The vaccination process will start with the registration of pre-screened individuals, actual vaccination and observation if they will exhibit adverse reactions.
Following the national guidelines, frontliners in Marikina hospitals will be the first to receive the vaccines that will come from national government.
Teodoro said the city’s own vaccine procurement will arrive in the third quarter of the year, adding an indemnification fund will be set aside by the city government.

Lord Allan Velasco as House Speaker in a sports club was deemed ""unconstitutional"" by a law expert on Monday, hours after Taguig Pateros Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano was ""ousted"" from the House leadership.
Lawmakers vote to install Velasco as House Speaker
Former UP Law Dean and constitutionalist Pacifico Agabin said that the installation of Velasco at the Celebrity Sports Plaza in Quezon City with a version of the House mace, the symbol of the authority of the chamber which should be present during sessions, violated a provision of the Constitution.
He explained that under Paragraph 5, Section 16 of Article 6, ""neither House during the sessions of the Congress shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.""
Agabin said lawmakers had no resolution that can legitimize the gathering at the sports club as a House session which is needed since it can express the collective sentiment of the lower chamber on a particular issue, person or event.
""Kung may resolution sila, siguro pwede ma-justify doon. E wala po ata silang resolution eh,"" Agabin told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.
(If they have a resolution, they can justify the gathering there. But they apparently don't have a resolution.)
""Balewala po [yung gathering] kasi labag sa Saligang Batas eh. Pwedeng ma-challenge 'yun sa husgado.""
(The gathering is useless since it's against the Constitution. That can be challenged before the court.)
He said that if Velasco and his allies want to properly install him as the next Speaker, they should find the time when regular House sessions continue at the plenary in Batasan Pambansa. But until then, Cayetano is still the Speaker.
However, the Taguig lawmaker earlier suspended regular sessions ahead of schedule, which led some lawmakers' to lament that the crucial 2021 spending plan has been ""sacrificed"" over a feud with his rival for the chamber's leadership.
'Politics, saboteurs': Cayetano explains what forced him to suspend budget debates, House session
Despite this, Velasco has already taken his ""oath"" as Speaker, which Cayetano and his allies rejected and mocked, calling it ""katawa-tawa"" (ridiculous) and ""fake."" They branded Velasco camp's move as ""illegal,"" citing the location of the session and the absence of an ""official"" House mace.
The Marinduque lawmaker later disputed this and said there was precedence for House sessions being held outside of Batasan Pambansa.
""Noong nagkaroon tayo ng pagsabog ng Taal Volcano (When the Taal Volcano exploded), the whole House went to... Batangas to hold a House session. [I]t’s the same. Under the rules, it is allowed. This wasn’t a sham session,"" Velasco said.
'Katawa-tawa, fake': Cayetano, ally reject Velasco's election as Speaker

Only 3 out of 10 Metro Manila residents willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19: DILG
Dr. Rommel Lobo, vice chairperson of the National Adverse Events Following Immunization Committee, said the government needs an intensive information campaign to address vaccine hesitancy following the survey.
""'Yun pong comorbidities na tinatawag natin - siya ay hypertensive, diabetic - hindi po yan kontra sa pagbabakuna. Dapat po, sila rin po, pinaprayoridad. Sila po ay pwede pa rin po bakunahan as long as na-control po lahat ng kanilang mga sakit,"" he told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.

(We can still make it. We just need to inform them that the vaccine that government will give them is safe and effective against COVID-19.)
Those with allergies unrelated to COVID-19 vaccines may also get inoculated but should be observed within 30 minutes from getting the jab, Lobo said.

MANILA — Three major urban hubs in the Philippines will serve as sites for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials as the government rushes to find an end to the pandemic that has upended life worldwide.
Metro Manila, the Southern Tagalog region (Calabarzon), and Cebu will serve as vaccine trial zones, Science Secretary Fortunato dela Peña said Thursday.
""Ang pinipili kasing lugar ay iyong mataas ang incidence ng COVID-19,"" he said in a virtual press briefing.
(We choose places with high incidence of COVID-19).
""Usually it will require anywhere between five to 10 barangays (villages) for a trial,"" he added.
The three areas have reported high numbers of COVID-19 infections, with Metro Manila as the coronavirus epicenter of the country.
The government's pandemic task force earlier approved guidelines for the conduct of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials which would require volunteers from villages with the highest number of coronavirus infections.
How will the Philippines run COVID-19 vaccine trials?
""Importante kasi na iyong lugar na pipiliin ay malapit doon sa mga lugar na mataas ang incidence o ang cases dahil ating susubukan ang efficacy nang bakuna,"" Dela Peña said.
(It's important that we choose an area near those that have high incidence of COVID-19 because we will test the efficacy of the vaccine.)
""Hindi puwedeng magdoble ang clinical trials sa isang zone,"" he noted.
(We cannot have duplicates of clinical trials in one zone.)
In assigning COVID-19 vaccine trial zones, Dela Peña said priority would be given to testing of drugs included in the World Health Organization's Solidarity Trials, a global coalition on the simultaneous development of vaccines.
Malacañang has expressed hopes that Manila would be prioritized by Russia, China, and the US should they develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

Mike insists there's still Sinulog.",sunstar,"January 14, 2021","P22M may yet be spentTO MANY people, Sinulog 2021 was totally canceled when the Regional IATF asked the mayor and national IATF to ban all physical and ""performance-based"" activities related to the cultural activity, a request that Sinulog Foundation Inc. and the steering committee acceded in what Vice Mayor Mike Rama, steering committee chief, called a ""prudent decision.""Without the ""ritual showdown"" at South Road Properties and the street dancing, not even for the purpose of video recording for a January 17 digital presentation, what parts of Sinulog were left?Apparently, Vice Mayor Mike Rama, SFI chairman and head of the steering committee, counts the online presentations they have done on the days leading to Sinulog day (in one of which Councilor Dondon Hontiveros was a judge).We still have the Sinulog, Mike Rama insisted in a privileged speech at the City Council Wednesday, January 13. To most people though, the Sinulog is the street dancing that culminates with the spectacular finale that used to be held at the Cebu City Sports Center and would've been held this year at SRP.If there were no more Sinulog, how could the P22 million (down from 2020's P40 million) be justified? ""Nakagasto na (we've already spent some of it),"" Rama said.Not to mention, but mentioned anyway, the Rama effort that had gone into the preparations. Mike said he already delivered 80 talks, including his January 13 Sanggunian speech, about the Sinulog, along with several planning sessions to come up with an ""unorthodox, unconventional and innovative"" celebration.To cap Mike Rama's non-physical Sinulog, there will be a Sinulog mass at Fort San Pedro Sunday, January 17. Will that count? Wait, won't that be a physical activity during a mass gathering of people?The dance contingents that have been disabled by the ban will get P150,000 per group and, maybe, another P150,000 in the middle of the year when the Philippine Christianization celebration starts. That P22 million may yet be spent.Coronavac? Bring it on, says EdCebu City Mayor Edgardo Labella is willing to be vaccinated with Coronavac manufactured by the Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac, a January 13 story by John Rey Saavedra of the government-run Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.In contrast, Ed's vice mayor, Michael Rama, will submit to inoculation provided it is not Coronavac, the Sinovac product. The Cebu City Council presiding officer said at a press conference Monday (January 11) that the vaccine he'd take must also be approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The mayor trusts the vaccine that the Brazil results show is only 50.4 percent effective. ""far less effective than initially touted in that country.""The vice mayor does not.Thus, the city's two top officials present contrasting endorsements. City residents also get conflicting messages.What if Labella's pitch would draw less followers than Mike Rama's message, would that tell anything about their respective popular support? Of course not but the city's residents expectedly will choose the vaccine they trust, on the basis of information from trusted sources.Mayor Labella though already said city residents are given the right to choose the brand they prefer -- unlike presidential spokesman Harry Roque who implied that beggars cannot be choosers. As of now, though, there is no other brand except Sinovac's Coronavac that the national government has contracted for and is like to reach the city first.VM Rama won't get his vaccination yet. And his name, if the threat will push through, will go to the bottom of the list, along with other names of people who reject Coronavac.Preparations for vaccineLocal media extensively reported the budgeting of money to buy vaccines against Covid-19 because it was among the conditions of the vice mayor for the approval of the much-scrutinized 2021 appropriation ordinance.It was the only preparation that was publicized because the high officials talked just this week about the mayor forming a vaccine board given the task to lay the groundwork for the arrival of the drugs and its application when they come.They were long ready to buy but had trusted Manila to tell them how while other local governments competing for the vaccines were already negotiating with the suppliers. The January 11 list of LGUs that signed deals with AstraZeneca unsurprisingly did not include Cebu City; the city is not even in the list of those talking with the suppliers. The reason: it has left to Manila the matter of procuring the vaccines.Cebu City, a premier city, is literally behind other smaller cities on the aspect of securing the vaccines. City Hall, however, insists it is not trailing other LGUs. It has to prove that by a rollout of city-bought vaccines earlier than the other local governments, to which delivery has already been contracted.***Tell us about it.[paseares1@gmail.com]",sunstar,2021-01-14 00:00:00,"P22M may yet be spentTO MANY people, Sinulog 2021 was totally canceled when the Regional IATF asked the mayor and national IATF to ban all physical and ""performance-based"" activities related to the cultural activity, a request that Sinulog Foundation Inc. and the steering committee acceded in what Vice Mayor Mike Rama, steering committee chief, called a ""prudent decision.""Without the ""ritual showdown"" at South Road Properties and the street dancing, not even for the purpose of video recording for a January 17 digital presentation, what parts of Sinulog were left?Apparently, Vice Mayor Mike Rama, SFI chairman and head of the steering committee, counts the online presentations they have done on the days leading to Sinulog day (in one of which Councilor Dondon Hontiveros was a judge).We still have the Sinulog, Mike Rama insisted in a privileged speech at the City Council Wednesday, January 13.To most people though, the Sinulog is the street dancing that culminates with the spectacular finale that used to be held at the Cebu City Sports Center and would've been held this year at SRP.If there were no more Sinulog, how could the P22 million (down from 2020's P40 million) be justified?City residents also get conflicting messages.What if Labella's pitch would draw less followers than Mike Rama's message, would that tell anything about their respective popular support?As of now, though, there is no other brand except Sinovac's Coronavac that the national government has contracted for and is like to reach the city first.VM Rama won't get his vaccination yet.And his name, if the threat will push through, will go to the bottom of the list, along with other names of people who reject Coronavac.Preparations for vaccineLocal media extensively reported the budgeting of money to buy vaccines against Covid-19 because it was among the conditions of the vice mayor for the approval of the much-scrutinized 2021 appropriation ordinance.It was the only preparation that was publicized because the high officials talked just this week about the mayor forming a vaccine board given the task to lay the groundwork for the arrival of the drugs and its application when they come.They were long ready to buy but had trusted Manila to tell them how while other local governments competing for the vaccines were already negotiating with the suppliers.The January 11 list of LGUs that signed deals with AstraZeneca unsurprisingly did not include Cebu City; the city is not even in the list of those talking with the suppliers.",2.0,0.9402999877929688,"astrazeneca, pfizer, ph, deal, sign, receive, dose, duterte, trial, roque","['bzzzzz', 'mix', 'message', 'mayor', 'labella', 'take', 'china', 'coronavac', 'vm', 'rama', 'insist', 'still', 'sinulog']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

But they were told there is no fixed date yet on when the vaccine will actually get here, she said.Loreche said they are still trying to determine how many medical workers who are 60 years old and above will get the AZ vaccine.On Monday, the DOH 7 reported that 1,397 medical workers from the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center (VSMMC) in Cebu City had been vaccinated with CoronaVac, the vaccine manufactured by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech Ltd., since Thursday, March 4.Of this number, 42 individuals experienced adverse effects, including dizziness, fatigue, lightheadedness, increase in blood pressure, headache, fainting and pain or numbness at the injection site.There were no reports of moderate or severe adverse effects that required hospitalization, Loreche said.The VSMMC received 7,200 doses of CoronaVac on Tuesday, March 2, the first batch of vaccines donated by the Chinese government to reach the Visayas.Loreche said if there are extra doses, these will be distributed to other DOH-manned hospitals, such as the Eversley Childs Sanitarium and General Hospital, the St. Anthony Mother and Child Hospital and the Talisay District Hospital.She said a total of 2,212 VSMMC personnel have agreed to be inoculated with CoronaVac.Loreche said they will soon distribute an additional 7,480 doses of CoronaVac to Levels 1, 2 and 3 public and private hospitals in Cebu.Of the 27,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine that Central Visayas is expected to receive, 14,680 doses have already been delivered to the DOH 7, she said.A second shipment of AZ vaccines arrived on Sunday, March 7, completing the first tranche of donations from the Covax facility.Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force Against Covid-19, received the shipment of 38,400 additional doses.These were transported by KLM Asia three days after the first shipment of 487,200 doses arrived.A total of 525,600 doses of AZ vaccine have now been delivered to the Philippines from Covax, the global initiative to ensure vaccine equity.To date, a total of 54,500 AZ doses have been deployed across the country.Of this number 1,500 doses have been sent to hospitals in the National Capital Region; 13,000 to Calabarzon; 10,000 to Cordillera Administrative Region; and 20,000 to Central Luzon.Galvez said the government aims to deploy an additional 240,720 doses to other regions this week.“Hopefully, yung Covax facility ay magdagdag ulit ng second tranche ng AstraZeneca. So ang expected natin ngayong May, pipilitin po natin matapos ‘yung lahat ng ating ospital. And then by April, magsisimula na tayo sa (vaccination ng) ibang mga sektor,” Galvez said.(Hopefully, the Covax facility will send an additional shipment of AZ vaccine.

city's preparation in the arrival of the vaccines.Duque, during the press conference, said the City Government's vaccination plan is aligned with the National Government's Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for Covid-19 Vaccines.""We have noticed as we went through with the various steps, and sequential at that, yung lahat ng (all the) elements of our plan are very clearly laid out,"" the DOH head said.The health official also lauded SPMC for ensuring that the vaccination plan is in order, and well executed.Duque also expressed optimism with the ""downward trend"" of Covid-19 cases in the city.""We would appreciate it if that trend continues,"" he said, adding that ""there is no room for complacency because this Covid-19 virus can always come back and oftentimes, it comes back with a vengeance.""Duque also stressed the importance of continuously imposing granular lockdown on specific areas with clustering of cases.Galvez, for his part, also lauded SPMC's preparation for the arrival of the vaccines.""Nakita namin 'yung SPMC, talagang very impressed ang... nakita namin na (Based on our observation, we are very impressed with the preparations made at SPMC.We saw it as) one of the best preparations, even th smallest details, pati lalagyan ng (even the placement of the) syringes,"" the NTF chief said.Davao City, along with other highly urbanized cities such as Metro Manila and Cebu City, are the priority areas in the initial rollout of vaccines due to the alarming recorded Covid-19 cases.Meanwhile, Nograles, a former Davao City first district representative, said the city has been conducting various simulation exercises for quite some time already like national disaster and fire drills.With the intensive preparation for the vaccine roll out, the cabinet secretary said they are confident that in the next phases of the vaccination, the city will further improve its execution.""We will make sure that the vaccination roll out will be successful, not only in Davao City but for the entire country,"" Nograles said.The city is set to conduct more simulation exercises in preparation for the arrival of the vaccines coming from the national government.Davao City Health Office acting head Dr. Ashley Lopez said in a recent press conference that there was a delay in the arrival of the vaccine due to the lack of a national bill that would provide a vaccine indemnification fund to compensate recipients who may suffer from side effects of Covid-19 shots.Lopez said he was informed by Galvez that the National Government, through

The national government's Bayanihan fund gave Dolores a P14-million subsidy to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic.""We are now sourcing from this (Bayanihan) fund for our response to Covid-19 pandemic,"" said Catuday.The town also has to spend for at least 900 LSIs or locally stranded individuals who arrived in Dolores from March to June.Dolores, Sulat, and seven other towns in Samar were placed under state of calamity in May when Typhoon Ambo, the first typhoon to visit the country this year, pummeled the province. As usual, the storm destroyed crops and damaged houses, displacing more than 140,000 people.Most houses in these towns are made of light materials.""Matagal bago kami makabangon, hirap kasi ang pagpapagawa (It takes a long time to recover because we don't have enough money to repair our houses),"" said Catuday.Charlie Rosaroso, head of the Sulat MDRRMO, said at least P1.5 million or 30 percent of the P5.1 million calamity fund for 2020 was spent to provide emergency assistance to families affected by Typhoon Ambo. The remaining funds were depleted by the Covid-19 response.He said he was only able to spare P300,000 to continue the training for volunteers on emergency response.Provinces and cities get five percent of the Internal Revenue Allotment (IRA), the local governments' share of national tax collections, for disaster risk resilience (DRR) under Republic Act 10121 or the Philippine Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act of 2010.Of the total calamity fund, 70 percent is allocated to prevention, mitigation and preparedness, and 30 percent is set aside as a Quick Response Fund (QRF).""What is left of our calamity fund is now being used for our Covid-19 response,"" said Rosaroso. These include relief goods, PPE for volunteers, hygiene kits, food packs for residents, as well as LSIsand ROFs (returning overseas Filipinos) undergoing quarantine.Sulat has hosted close to 200 LSIs since March.A fourth-class municipality with a population of close to 16,000, Sulat does not have a hospital, but there is one doctor in each of the rural health centers in 18 barangays, said Rosaroso.As of August 10, there were eight confirmed cases of Covid-19 infection in Eastern Samar and most of them came from Metro Manila. Both Catuday and Rosaroso said there were no confirmed cases in their towns, as they work even on Sundays to ensure health and hygiene protocols are properly implemented.Mario Candelaria, chairman of Barangay San Francisco in Sulat, said: ""An infection here is a nightmare because we don't have a hospital.""""Noon 'pag galing Maynila sinasalubong ng mga taga dito, ngayon nilalayuan na (Before, those who arrived from Manila got a welcome, now people avoid them,"" said Candelaria.He said the P110,000 calamity fund of San Francisco has also been used for food packs, hygiene kits, and for disinfecting public facilities.Exposed and vulnerableThe Philippines ranked second in terms of exposure and vulnerability to climate-related risks in the Global Climate Change Risk Report for 2020 of Germanwatch, the environment think tank. Japan topped the list.Red Constantino, executive director of the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities (ICSC), said the report showed that ""Those who are least responsible for the problem, are the ones who are suffering the most. This is unacceptable.""""The pandemic has largely revealed systemic weaknesses that would have just taken more time to uncover otherwise,"" said Constantino.The German report noted that strong tropical cyclones such as Bopha (""Pablo"") 2012, Haiyan (""Yolanda"") 2013 and Mangkhut (""Ompong"") 2018 have been recorded in the last 10 years, affecting mostly the poor and vulnerable population.At least 74 percent of the country's population is susceptible to multiple hazards, including coastal hazards such as typhoons, storm surges and rising sea levels, according to the 2018 World Risk Report. The report ranked the Philippines third among countries most vulnerable to disaster risks.The catastrophic impact of Tropical Depression Ondoy in 2009 cost Marikina and Pasig cities P22.54 billion, of which Pasig accounted for 90 percent.Rich city gets more moneyThis time around, Pasig City had to let go of critical spending for disaster risk resilience programs due to the pandemic response, said Bryant Wong, the city disaster risk reduction and management officer. These included reducing the number of fire engines and rescue vehicles to be purchased.""We did not expect Covid-19 pandemic to affect us all, but we need to respond to it the best way we can,"" Wong said.Unlike Sulat and Dolores, however, Pasig City Hall has deeper pockets and generous donors.Of the P600-million calamity fund for 2020, the City Government has spent half for the Covid-19 pandemic response, Wong said.It also managed to utilize an additional P200 million from the P300 million DRR savings in the last five years.Other funding sources for Pasig City's Covid-19 response included a P1.2-billion supplemental fund for the Social Amelioration Program (SAP) and another P1.2 billion for tablets to be used by students for online classes, from the Special Education Fund.The city also received P136 million from the Bayanihan fund, equivalent to one month of its IRA.Wong said private donations of beds, PPEs, hygiene kits and rapid testing kits worth P50 million boosted the city's pandemic response.The private sector also donated 100,000 food packs to Pasig.In the case of Sulat and Dolores towns, there are no big corporate donors, which meant that the money for food packs distributed to locked-down residents came from their calamity funds.Funding sourcesUndersecretary Ricardo Jalad of the Office of Civil Defense, also the executive director of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council Council (NDRRMC), told local government units (LGUs) in a webinar in July to learn ""to adjust, transform and adapt strategies to manage response to Covid-19 pandemic and prepare for multiple hazards from natural calamities.""During the webinar, John Aries Macaspac, a director of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM), enumerated funding sources for the Covid-19 response, including the Special DRRM Trust Fund or the savings from DRR funds in the last five years, a month's worth of IRA from the national government and realigned funds from the General Fund. LGUs may also use 20 percent of their development funds for the purchase of PPEs, rapid test kits, vitamins, medicines, accommodation and expenses of health workers, construction of rental quarantine facilities, mobile testing labs, tents, shelters for the homeless, and training for pandemic response, under guidelines issued by the DBM and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG).The ""Bayanihan to Heal as One"" or Republic Act 11469 allocated P37 billion for the emergency Covid-19 response of LGUs. It allocated P12.4 billion to all cities, P18.39 billion to municipalities and P6.2 billion to provinces.Constantino said responses to the Covid-19 pandemic and climate emergency should go hand in hand, as both require the expertise of scientists and policies and actions based on evidence.Scientists, he noted, advised physical distancing to prevent the transmission Covid-19 while waiting for a vaccine to be developed. Scientists have also stressed the urgency of limiting the rise of global temperatures to below 1.5 degrees Celsius to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.""We do not have the luxury to choose whether we need protection from the deadly fevers induced by the novel coronavirus or from an increasingly feverish planet. Just as climate change is not an environmental problem but a development crisis, so is Covid-19 not merely a human health crisis but an ecological problem,"" said Constantino.

We would get all the old clothes of our parents and dressed up like cowboys and Indians. We used the headboards as our horses. One of my cousins would always stick out his improvised bow and arrow and would tell me “money or life?” My answer would always be “or” and he would say, “I will take your money then your life.” We would end our little make-believe game with being friends at the end.Today, we are faced with a great dilemma whether to continue with the restrictions to stop the spread of the dreaded Covid-19 virus or to lift the restrictions and declare a “new normal” for economic reasons. We are now being conditioned that the transmission is somehow contained and the cases are low, especially in the province and in the city. Soon, businesses will again start booming. But the authorities warn that while we convert to the “new normal,” health protocols would essentially be part of that norm.We are also made to believe that the vaccine will soon be on our shores and we could surely beat Covid-19. We praise and thank God for giving us people to study and stop the transmission of the virus. We now fervently pray that the vaccine will be shared with all mankind. However, today, we become hesitant and reluctant about this vaccine because of the many news and opinions that come out about its efficacy. I wish that we could be like the other countries that have already started their vaccination programs. We need to put off all politics and shadows of corruption in the whole process of mass vaccination. Only if this administration has the political will and believes in the efficacy of the vaccines, will we not have to worry about anything. But with all the hullaballoos, doubt will always linger.Now, we are faced with the question, “money or life?” Could we answer this question fairly and squarely? If we choose money, then forget all about the health issues and let us all live the same way as before. We can only get back what we have lost economically and financially if we go back to our old materialistic and secular ways. Profit and money are the end of it all at the compromise of life. This was where we were leading before the pandemic came in. I am quite disappointed because it seems that we did not learn lessons from other countries. We seem to like the experience of a second tranche of the virus. I am also confused with what we are doing and saying- they are either contrary or contradictory. We seem to say something but do otherwise. Is this the character of the new normal or is this the aftereffect of Covid-19?If we choose life over money, then we need to be very cautious of everything. The government should be sincere in saving us. The government should have the political will not to make us guinea pigs or laboratory rats to benefit the capitalists in this business we call pandemic.

He did not mention the owner of the farm.""Our inventory for the whole province is only five percent and it's not enough to cover the demand for pork in the province alone.

https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/1884577/Cebu/Opinion/Malilong-Waiting-for-the-vaccine,Malilong: Waiting for the vaccine,FRANK MALILONG,"February 01, 2021","LAST week, I received a text message from a friend in the province, dismissing the coronavirus as fake. The pandemic is a hoax, she said.Having lost a few close friends to the Covid-19, I felt slighted by the cavalier attitude, but I resisted the urge to engage her in a debate because I knew from the tenor of her message (all caps and punctuated by exclamation points) that it would be pointless.Sadly, she is not alone. In fact, I have decided to stop reading the comments in the daily bulletin issued by the Department of Health because it distressed me to know that until now, with confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country breaching the half million mark and coronavirus-related deaths numbering almost 11,000, many people still believe that the pandemic is a government invention from which officials and cronies are making money.Maybe, they should try working in the hospital so they will understand that there is a real disease in our midst and it could kill people. Or maybe, it would not be such a bad idea to have them catch the virus themselves, lose their sense of smell, nurse a fever and a cough, gasp for breath, get intubated and still survive and be confronted with the burden of the cost of hospitalization.If it’s any consolation, this insanity is not peculiar to us. All over the world, we hear stories of people who claim that the coronavirus is nothing but a conspiracy calculated to further enrich billionaires like Bill Gates. This planet is full of weirdos.Last Sunday in Los Angeles, California, around 50 demonstrators blocked the entrance to the Dodgers Stadium for about an hour even as a long column of motorists waited outside to have themselves vaccinated. The protesters did not believe in the vaccine, dismissing it as another scam, which, it must be stressed, is within their right to do. But the idea of the minority imposing their belief on the many is simply ridiculous.I do not think that this behavior will show its face here, notwithstanding the skepticism by some towards the pandemic and consequently towards the vaccine. In the first place, I do not think our authorities will be as tolerant as their American counterparts who let the LA protesters go and did not file any charges. Our policemen will only be too willing to haul off to jail anyone who causes a similar disruption.Which reminds me, how soon can we start vaccination in Cebu? Sooner than earlier planned, I hope. The current surge in coronavirus infections should prod our officials to readjust their timetable to an earlier date.As a matter of fact, our officials should already have a plan on the mechanics of the rollout this early. Compared to the other vaccines, the one for Covid is said to be more perishable. Do we already have a plan where to store them and how quickly we can inject them to the people?And who are the people who will get the vaccine in Cebu City, for example? Should they be limited to the city residents only? What about those who reside outside but work in the city? Shouldn’t they be the concern of the city government, too?If the first batch of vaccines is not enough for every Cebu City resident, who will enjoy priority? We are not known to patiently wait for our turn. If we do not have a plan now, there will be confusion. Other countries, including the US, went through that.

WENCESLAO,"December 09, 2020","YESTERDAY was a historic day, sort of, for mankind and a Filipina was in the midst of it. In Coventry, central England, 90-year-old Margaret Keenan became the first person to receive a Covid-19 vaccine at the start of what has been considered the biggest vaccination program in that country’s history. Britain, after all, is one of the countries worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. It is also the first country to approve the vaccine produced by the giant pharmaceutical firm Pfizer-BioNTech. Interestingly, the vaccine was administered on Keenan by Filipina nurse May Parsons.This means that the worldwide fight against the Covid-19 pandemic is about to be won although it will take months before our fears will finally be driven away. It is fitting that a Filipina frontliner would be in the midst of this because of the role Filipinos played worldwide in easing the negative effects of the pandemic as frontliners.It is just unfortunate that at a time when we have seen the light at the end of the tunnel, dark forces are also casting shadows in social media. Anti-vaccine posts are being spread around, some of them fake news about the supposed bad effects of the vaccine on the body. This should concern us more considering how some people demonized the anti-dengue vaccine the administration of former president Ninoy Aquino purchased.And here’s another worry. The Duterte government seems to be leaning towards Coronavac, the vaccine produced by the Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech, which has a record of bribing Chinese regulatory officials in relation to vaccines for other illnesses that it produced. This, plus our usual bias against Chinese-made products, should dent efforts to make the Covid-19 immunization in the country universal and effective. Of course, authorities are also looking into the efficacy of vaccines from Western firms like AstraZeneca.Then there is the cost. Coronavac’s price ranges from $30 per dose to $60 per dose. To acquire 50 million doses at $30 per dose, the government would need around P75 billion. I don’t know how big the Duterte administration’s budget is to purchase the vaccine. This would mean that administering the Covid-19 vaccine for the entire population would be slow.One advantage for Coronavac is that it can be stored without costly refrigeration. Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be shipped at -70 Celsius, which is supposedly colder than the average winter temperatures at the South Pole. Coronavac can be stored at temperatures roughly equivalent to that of a home freezer. That is one of the reasons Indonesia chose Coronavac and will start mass inoculation ahead of us.President Duterte preferred frontliners and the marginalized to be the first in line when the mass inoculation starts in the country. Senior citizens will also be given preference. The other sectors will have to wait. Which means that the whole of next year will be crucial.

But then who will be sued and by whom if people die or become ill from the un-approved vaccines?Cancelling Tomas, Mike, EdOther candidates: A Facebook post by a radio broadcaster ruled out these probable candidates in the 2022 Cebu City election for mayor: [1] Tomas Osmeña, multiple-termer mayor -- ""sickly and old"" (73 next July 26); [2] Edgardo Labella, incumbent mayor, ""indecisive""; and [3] Mike Rama, ""too much in love with his voice."" ""Wa nay lain diha""? the broadcaster asked.There are other mayorables. On the BOPK side, Representative Bebot Abellanosa of the south district might run for mayor, with Councilor Franklyn Ong, Association of Barangay Councils (ABC) rep in the City Council, as vice mayor. The other probable bets are former, three-term councilor Margot Osmeña and her husband Tomas who cannot be ruled out despite Margot's reported edict against his return to politics as a candidate.In the Barug camp, Mayor Labella holds the ""equity of the incumbent"" unless plain weariness of the job or Mike Rama's persistence to make a comeback would persuade him to skip the next race. Mike is the ubiquitous factor, always in the picture as a probable runner, against the BOPK contender or even Labella himself.Or Mike might opt for the slot of congressman that Abellanosa will vacate. Three-termer Bebot might decide not to pass on to a son the slot for the seat that has kept him in the House for nine straight years. If Mike chooses to shift forums -- from the City Council as presiding officer to Congress as one among 304 congressmen and congresswomen -- he will have to persuade former councilor Joy Pesquera not to run again (her second, after her loss to Bebot in 2019).Regarding the broadcaster's reasons for cancelling Tomas, Edgar and Mike, none of those ""disabilities"" or weaknesses have stopped voters not to vote for them.

And she slipped in the Cebuano self-deprecating phrase ""Tiguwang na ko.""It was obviously an aside, a parenthetical detour, a put-down aimed to support her unconcern about criticisms on policy or official behavior.When she said the ""T"" word, her supporters must have quickly looked at the screen on phone, tablet or PC -- and were totally unconvinced.VFA, visas; what's the dif?Element of threat: The US Government struck back at Filipino officials who are suspected of violating human rights and, more recently, harassing journalists. How? By denying the ""erring"" officials visas to the United States through a provision in separate laws.President Duterte threatened to terminate the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) if the US would not deliver 20 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines.Grant of visas is the sole prerogative of the US government, which was not among the terms of the VFA. And the vaccines cannot be made a condition in the VFA since they are Pfizer's private property, unless the US government pays for the vaccines or gets it from the federal stock to deliver to us.Besides, the threat converts the request into some form of blackmail, which is in bad taste to Filipinos, if not the Americans.",sunstar,2020-12-30 00:00:00,"It will go after distributors of ""illegal and unregistered"" vaccines, FDA chief Eric Domingo said Monday, December 28.But then who will sue high officials who ordered or allowed the vaccination?Not the FDA.How about those who submitted to the made-in-China vaccine?But then who will be sued and by whom if people die or become ill from the un-approved vaccines?Cancelling Tomas, Mike, EdOther candidates: A Facebook post by a radio broadcaster ruled out these probable candidates in the 2022 Cebu City election for mayor: [1] Tomas Osmeña, multiple-termer mayor -- ""sickly and old"" (73 next July 26); [2] Edgardo Labella, incumbent mayor, ""indecisive""; and [3] Mike Rama, ""too much in love with his voice.""The other probable bets are former, three-term councilor Margot Osmeña and her husband Tomas who cannot be ruled out despite Margot's reported edict against his return to politics as a candidate.In the Barug camp, Mayor Labella holds the ""equity of the incumbent"" unless plain weariness of the job or Mike Rama's persistence to make a comeback would persuade him to skip the next race.Mike is the ubiquitous factor, always in the picture as a probable runner, against the BOPK contender or even Labella himself.Or Mike might opt for the slot of congressman that Abellanosa will vacate.If Mike chooses to shift forums -- from the City Council as presiding officer to Congress as one among 304 congressmen and congresswomen -- he will have to persuade former councilor Joy Pesquera not to run again (her second, after her loss to Bebot in 2019).Regarding the broadcaster's reasons for cancelling Tomas, Edgar and Mike, none of those ""disabilities"" or weaknesses have stopped voters not to vote for them.",2.0,0.9074000120162964,"astrazeneca, pfizer, ph, deal, sign, receive, dose, duterte, trial, roque","['seare', 'crime', 'sue', 'cancel', 'toma', 'edgar', 'gwen', 'word']",-0.6705,0.478,0.522,0.0,0.0,Negative

Invited to the separate meetings with the theme ""Bakunado, Protektado"" were representatives of homeowners groups, religious groups, civic groups, Sangguniang Kabataan, the Gender Development Office and the City Administrator's Office.During the first meeting held February 10, the resource speakers were Infection Prevention and Control for Committee Chair Charissa Borja-Tabora of Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and Jesusa Joyce Cirunay of the Food and Drug Administration. Ms. Borja-Tabora underscored the safety of vaccines, the process of clinical trials, and the role of vaccines in protecting individuals and communities. Ms. Cirunay discussed the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization and the stringent process and policies for the approval of vaccines.During the second meeting held last Thursday, Dr. Jose Mari Castro of the Department of Health shared his insights on the nature of Covid-19, means of transmission and safeguards to protect oneself and the community.A special feature of both town hall meetings was an AVP specially prepared by the Public Information Office, headed by Tez V. Navarro, explaining the need to have oneself vaccinated. The AVP also answered frequently asked questions regarding the safety of FDA-approved vaccines.In a February 11 Covid survey involving 17,561 respondents from Muntinlupa's nine barangays, 4,484 respondents or 24 percent indicated they were not willing to be vaccinated. The most common reasons cited were fear of side effects, doubts about the efficiency rate of the vaccine and cost of vaccination, exacerbated obviously by conflicting information circulating in social media.Dr. Teresa ""Tet"" Tuliao, Muntinlupa City CHO, is targeting 383,000 or 70 percent of the entire city population -- the minimum number for Muntinlupeños to be able to gain ""herd immunity.""Dr. Tuliao said the city has identified 6,758 medical frontliners from barangay health centers, emergency responders, the Ospital ng Muntinlupa and six private hospitals, including Asian Hospital, who can inject the vaccines. They will be organized into 82 vaccinations teams and deployed in 35 vaccination posts. They have the capability of vaccinating 8,200 individuals per day.Muntinlupa City will give priority to front-liners such as health workers and uniformed personnel. Next in line are indigent senior citizens, followed by other senior citizens.Vaccination during Spanish timesAt various periods during the Spanish era, the Philippines was hit by smallpox, bubonic plague, and cholera and it was interesting how the authorities dealt with them.In the 1800s, smallpox infected most of the Spanish territories, in South America and the Philippines. According to historian Ambeth Ocampo, the then reigning Spanish monarch, Carlos IV, ordered a vaccination expedition to head for the territories in 1803. The group was headed by Francisco Javier de Balmis.In the late 1700s, Spain already had a vaccine for smallpox and in fact Carlos IV had his immediate family inoculated. But the problem was how to transport the vaccine because of the long voyage involved. Balmis came up with the novel idea of using live carriers. From Spain to Mexico and from Mexico to Manila, Balmis used orphans working a relay system. During the voyage, Balmis transmitted the vaccine in sequence, from child to child, arm to arm, along the way to their destination.To cut a long story short, Balmis and his boys eventually reached Manila in 1805. The Spanish Governor-General Rafael Aguilar immediately had his own children inoculated. This softened the initial resistance of Bishop Domingo Collantes, the Archbishop of Manila, who was not keen on vaccination. Eventually, Balmis inoculated 20,000 inhabitants in Manila and environs. Balmis' assistants later proceeded to Misamis and Zamboanga. From Manila, Balmis brought Filipino orphans to Macau and Canton for a similar inoculation exercise.A bronze monument of Carlos IV, in front of the Manila Cathedral in Intramuros, and a historical marker at the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine commemorate the Balmis vaccination expedition.Note: You may wish to share the foregoing article via Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn.",sunstar,2021-02-22 00:00:00,"FOR two consecutive weeks, Muntinlupa City held virtual town hall meetings to drum up high participation in its forthcoming Covid vaccination program.Invited to the separate meetings with the theme ""Bakunado, Protektado"" were representatives of homeowners groups, religious groups, civic groups, Sangguniang Kabataan, the Gender Development Office and the City Administrator's Office.During the first meeting held February 10, the resource speakers were Infection Prevention and Control for Committee Chair Charissa Borja-Tabora of Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and Jesusa Joyce Cirunay of the Food and Drug Administration.Ms. Borja-Tabora underscored the safety of vaccines, the process of clinical trials, and the role of vaccines in protecting individuals and communities.Ms. Cirunay discussed the FDA's Emergency Use Authorization and the stringent process and policies for the approval of vaccines.During the second meeting held last Thursday, Dr. Jose Mari Castro of the Department of Health shared his insights on the nature of Covid-19, means of transmission and safeguards to protect oneself and the community.A special feature of both town hall meetings was an AVP specially prepared by the Public Information Office, headed by Tez V.

That is why I am volunteering myself to assure and show everyone that this is safe and effective. Disregard your fears and doubts now and let's unite to end the pandemic,"" he said on Friday, minutes before he got his jab, which was personally inoculated by DOH Secretary Francisco Duque III.Frontliners' experiencesAfter Audan, 149 more health workers from SPMC received the vaccine on the first day of rollout.""The goal is to inoculate 150 employees a day. We initially target to finish the vaccination for the first dose for 12 days but we were told to double time and committed to doing it in five days or a week,"" Audan said.One of the first four health frontliners who received the vaccine is Dr. Almera Manan, an Internal Medicine resident in SPMC for three years.

If we don't have a vaccine, the possibility of getting Covid-19 is still high,"" he said.He also added that the vaccine administrators secured their informed consent and that they underwent a health screening to ensure that those who will be vaccinated are eligible.Infectious disease specialist Dr. Marie Yvette C. Barez also shared she felt completely normal after getting her CoronaVac jab.""I am okay. I do not feel anything weird or bad. As an infectious disease specialist, it is my responsibility to protect myself, family, and even the community.

Estuya, the arrival of the vaccine is a ray of hope, especially for frontliners.""I've been in the fight against Covid-19 for a year now, and I'm lucky enough to not contract the virus. But the daily fear is always there. With the vaccine, the anxiety and fear we feel every day were lowered, we are now more hopeful that there is light at the end of the tunnel,"" he said.Estuya has been an SPMC employee for a decade now.For a health worker who is dealing with Covid-19 cases daily, Estuya shared that getting a jab is what he has been hoping for months since the start of the pandemic.""Daily, I am dealing with Covid-19 cases, even with the PPE on, I am still afraid, not just for myself but more on the possibility of bringing the virus to my home where my senior citizen parents and pregnant wife are,"" he shared.""Nalipay gyud ko na naabot na ang vaccine (I am happy that the vaccine has finally arrived here). And if ever I'll test positive for Cvid-19 - God forbids - at least, with the vaccine, I won't be a severe or critical case,"" he said.Vaccination campaignTo further raise awareness about the efficacy of the Covid-19 vaccines, the Presidential Communications Operations Office-Office of the Global Media and Public Affairs (PCOO-OGMPA) launched on March 3, a series of explainer videos dubbed ""The VAXplainer.""""The VAXplainer is only a part of our numerous efforts and commitment to make Filipinos fully understand the importance of vaccines and convince them to be inoculated with the available safe and effective vaccines provided by the government,"" PCOO Secretary Martin Andanar said in a press statement.The first episode of the VAXplainer focuses on the personal experience of Philippine Ambassador to Bahrain Alfonso Ver in getting vaccinated during the first phase of Bahrain's vaccination program from December 2020 to January 2021.""The VAXplainer"" can be viewed on PTV and IBC-13.

Early on, our officials must know that two-thirds of the vaccines produced would go to the affluent countries first and the rest of the supply would be fought over by the rest of the world.Mayor Labella appeared to have trusted the people in Manila a bit more than necessary, without getting a place in the long line for the vaccines.Still awaiting go-signalCebu City's plan to buy vaccines, on top of what the national government would allocate to the city, was unwrapped third quarter last year yet.The mayor announced the plan on August 5, 2020. Almost four months later, on December 15, Labella said Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the country's vaccine czar and chief implementer of the Inter-Agency Task Force for Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-MEID), ""assured"" him the city would get an ample supply of the vaccines due to the national government. Last Monday, January 11, the mayor said the city was ""ready to buy"" and was waiting for the IATF rules.Being ready to buy, alas, is not enough. It is even distressing to Cebuanos who watch other LGUs already waving contracts, awaiting delivery while our city still has to join the queue.Signed or negotiatingThe LGUs with already-signed deals include the cities of Bacolod, Baguio, Caloocan, and Dagupan, all with AstraZeneca.Mayor Labella still has to tell Cebuanos: (a) why he is still waiting for the IATF rules when Baguio, for one, already signed a multipartite agreement that includes the national task force and DOH; (b) why many other cities have already been coordinating with pharmaceutical companies for access to Pfizer and AstraZeneca.A list published Wednesday, January 13, said that over 30 provinces and cities have already allocated funds to buy the vaccines and ""most of them"" have already signed with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.That list with AstraZeneca contracts includes: nine from National Capital Region, led by Makati City with one million doses and Manila, 800,000; three from Luzon; two from Visayas -- Iloilo City, 600,000, and Ormoc City, 270,000; and two from Mindanao -- Zamboanga City, 400,000, and Oroquita City, 120,000. Others in the AstraZeneca list but did not discloses the volume of their purchase include Bacolod City and Davao City.'Playing God'The vaccines issue has spawned other issues that affect not just local public officials, particularly in Cebu, but also their constituents:[1] VACCINE OF CHOICE. The nation entrusts to the president and the IATF, central authority and coordinator in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the decision on quarantine measures and choosing vaccine to use.People are puzzled however why and how the Philippines secured 25 million doses of the vaccines from China's Sinovac, the first batch scheduled to be delivered this February. Sinovac's vaccine is generally reputed to be (a) only 50 percent effective, (b) one of the two most expensive in the market and, Senate President Vicente Sotto III asked this week at a committee hearing, (c) still has to apply for EUA or emergency use authorization. Senator Ping Lacson said Sinovac had not yet applied and ""yet you concluded a contract with Sinovac for 25 million doses.""[2] 'PLAYING GOD.' Any purchase of vaccine by a local government from the supplier requires the national government to be the third party. A number of senators asked why this is so, why LGUs and private companies are given more room. ""Do you want to play God?"" asked Senator Franklin Drilon. Maybe not but the rule complicates and delays, as in the case of Cebu City, the rollout of the vaccines.If that is a requirement, as Mayor Labella was repeatedly told by Manila, why and how have many LGUs gone around it and directly dealt with AstraZeneca? Galvez explained that the national government only signs a ""term sheet"" to ""lock in the logistics so that they can start."" It is ""a supply agreement to determine the term of payment and delivery, he said."" Was Mayor Labella told that? Why was the mayor, as of January 11, still waiting for IATF go-signal?[3] RIGHT TO REJECT. The citizen's right to reject a vaccine he does not trust is upheld by Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque. But he implied that Filipinos who get the vaccine for free have no choice.Beggars cannot be choosers? The rejection is itself a form of choice. And wait, this is taxpayers' money, not from the officials who crafted the policy.Significantly, the pandemic does not take away citizens' right to question and assail government decisions that defy plain good sense.",sunstar,2021-01-13 00:00:00,"Early on, our officials must know that two-thirds of the vaccines produced would go to the affluent countries first and the rest of the supply would be fought over by the rest of the world.Mayor Labella appeared to have trusted the people in Manila a bit more than necessary, without getting a place in the long line for the vaccines.Still awaiting go-signalCebu City's plan to buy vaccines, on top of what the national government would allocate to the city, was unwrapped third quarter last year yet.The mayor announced the plan on August 5, 2020.It is even distressing to Cebuanos who watch other LGUs already waving contracts, awaiting delivery while our city still has to join the queue.Signed or negotiatingThe LGUs with already-signed deals include the cities of Bacolod, Baguio, Caloocan, and Dagupan, all with AstraZeneca.Mayor Labella still has to tell Cebuanos: (a) why he is still waiting for the IATF rules when Baguio, for one, already signed a multipartite agreement that includes the national task force and DOH; (b) why many other cities have already been coordinating with pharmaceutical companies for access to Pfizer and AstraZeneca.A list published Wednesday, January 13, said that over 30 provinces and cities have already allocated funds to buy the vaccines and ""most of them"" have already signed with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.That list with AstraZeneca contracts includes: nine from National Capital Region, led by Makati City with one million doses and Manila, 800,000; three from Luzon; two from Visayas -- Iloilo City, 600,000, and Ormoc City, 270,000; and two from Mindanao -- Zamboanga City, 400,000, and Oroquita City, 120,000.'Playing God'The vaccines issue has spawned other issues that affect not just local public officials, particularly in Cebu, but also their constituents:[1] VACCINE OF CHOICE.The nation entrusts to the president and the IATF, central authority and coordinator in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, the decision on quarantine measures and choosing vaccine to use.People are puzzled however why and how the Philippines secured 25 million doses of the vaccines from China's Sinovac, the first batch scheduled to be delivered this February.Any purchase of vaccine by a local government from the supplier requires the national government to be the third party.Maybe not but the rule complicates and delays, as in the case of Cebu City, the rollout of the vaccines.If that is a requirement, as Mayor Labella was repeatedly told by Manila, why and how have many LGUs gone around it and directly dealt with AstraZeneca?Why was the mayor, as of January 11, still waiting for IATF go-signal?",5.0,0.9506999850273132,"city, worker, health, doh, get, trial, first, astrazeneca, sinovac, rollout","['seare', 'cebu', 'city', 'official', 'drop', 'ball', 'mayor', 'labella', 'trust', 'iatfs', 'galvez', 'still', 'wait', 'lgus', 'clinch', 'deal']",0.296,0.108,0.722,0.17,0.0,Positive

Details of the ceremony were still being finalized in coordination with the Embassy of China.In Negros, Roque said some government officials would attend the arrival ceremony. He did not mention whether President Rodrigo Duterte, who had expressed his wish to personally accept the donation, would be there.In the same press briefing with Roque, UP-PGH Medical Director Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi said the UP-PGH has already released a statement that they will accept whatever vaccine that will come with an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Legaspi said the UP-PGH is ready in terms of the infrastructure and logistical requirements of vaccination, including the availability of freezers for the vaccines and the information technology requirement.He stressed that what is important to remember is that whatever vaccine comes will make a difference in helping control the spread of the infection and that the PGH is ready to accept vaccines regardless of brand or where the vaccines came from.Legaspi explained that a 50 percent efficacy means that a person will have a 50 percent probability of developing mild symptoms of Covid-19.The probability of not having moderate symptoms is 75 percent, and the probability that a person is protected from severe Covid-19 is almost 100 percent.He stressed though that all vaccines that will be approved by the FDA will give almost 100 percent protection from developing severe Covid-19.On the prioritization for the vaccine rollout, Roque said the order of prioritization will still be followed.“Una pa rin po dyan ang medical frontliners. Despite the EUA issued by the FDA, nilinaw po yan ni Dr. [Rolando Enrique] Domingo na hindi po ipinagbabawal na ibigay ito sa health professionals,” he said.Roque underscored that this is why it is important to get the position of medical frontliners on the issue because they can still be prioritized for the Sinovac vaccine if they agree to be vaccinated with it.“Wala pong pilitan, yung gustong mag-antay nga po ng ibang brands, siguro ang concession na maibibigay sa kanila is pwede silang humindi at pwede silang mag-antay without losing their priority,” said Roque.Roque was in Negros Oriental to attend a program on the readiness of the province for the vaccination program.Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo said 21 out of 25 municipalities have active cases. As of Thursday, there were 123 active cases in the province.Degamo also informed Roque that the first molecular laboratory in Negros Oriental is now fully operational, as well as a 34-room isolation facility at the Negros Oriental Provincial Hospital.

Yup, I look forward to stepping out of the house without fear of contracting the virus, minus the face mask and shield, mingle with family and friends, hug them and travel!But before you hop on that plane and head off to your favorite out-of-town destination after your shot, why not give local tourism its much-needed shot to jumpstart the local community’s economy? By local, I mean Davao City. Give love to your hometown.That’s what I intend to do. I actually started before the lockdown was implemented, when the scare of the pandemic was slowly crawling into our lives and the local economy was slowing down. I called for “travel local” and kicked off the series of staycations at Park Inn by Radisson Blu. Unfortunately, the lockdown came and the series was cut. I’m reviving it as soon as I get vaccinated.True, I could still have done the staycation series pre-vaccine, but I’m not the brave one. Covid-19 has hit too close to home. I’ve seen friends lose their loved ones. I’m not gambling.Let me share my list. Enjoy a couple of nights in these beautiful places.Park Inn by Radisson Blu. If you're a shopaholic and a foodie, the hotel’s location is perfect for you as it is connected to a mall. But the hotel has its offerings that will keep you indoors. For one, the burger is wicked! The healthy drinks will go perfectly while lounging by the pool on a hot day, and you can call for a therapist for a relaxing massage.Seda Abreeza Hotel is also right across a mall. It may be a business hotel but it’s also a great place to escape from the daily grind without driving far. The rooms are totally relaxing and breakfast is great. You will love the kakanins (local delicacies) among the typical breakfast offerings.Waterfront Insular Hotel Davao offers the best of both worlds. It’s a seaside resort hotel but within the city. Who doesn’t want waking up to fresh sea air blowing from Davao Gulf, it's therapeutic, so is the green expanse. To complete the paradise experience, the food is superb. Aside from the favorites—pizza, halo-halo, etc., the new chef is whipping her magic on the menu.Eden Nature Park & Resort. If you love the late autumn chill, this is the perfect time to stay in this mountain resort. The forest vibe – verdant greenery, sunlight peeking through towering trees, crisp mountain air—is healing, and that’s what we need after months of seclusion. Food is fresh since they harvest it from the “backyard,” and outdoor activities are adrenaline-rushing.From the highlands of Eden Nature Park head to Island Buenavista. The sister resort is a tropical paradise! It’s like your own private island that you can hike from end to end. It’s blessed with a wide white-sand shoreline, cool and clear blue water, and lavish greenery (where the living quarters are ensconced) to contrast the blue and whites of the delightful picture before you. Oh, the food is great, too! The fresh coconut treat is just perfect for this setting.Exploring more of the islands, Dusit Thani Davao’s island resort is Lubi Plantation, in Kopiat Island. The island destination also makes for a perfect escape from city life. If you like luxury, then this is a place for you. Living spaces are modern takes on villas in a plantation with its own private pool with a view of the sea. The setting can be very romantic.Who doesn’t love Pearl Farm Beach Resort? The first luxury destination in Davao and Mindanao is still a favorite after three decades. Built-in the former pearl farm in the Davao Gulf, the natural and well-designed architecture by a renowned architect and an interior motif that speak Davaoeño made the place iconic (a photo by the Parola is a bragging right). In this resort, one night is never enough.Once you’ve made your rounds, travel farther to the neighboring Davao provinces, they all need the help we can give.***Follow jeepneyjinggoy on Instagram and FacebookFor more photos about this feature and other travel stories, visit www.jeepneyjinggoy.comFor lifestyle features, visit www.ofapplesandlemons.comEmail me at jinggoysalvador@yahoo.com",sunstar,2020-12-05 00:00:00,"Yup, I look forward to stepping out of the house without fear of contracting the virus, minus the face mask and shield, mingle with family and friends, hug them and travel!But before you hop on that plane and head off to your favorite out-of-town destination after your shot, why not give local tourism its much-needed shot to jumpstart the local community’s economy?Give love to your hometown.That’s what I intend to do.I called for “travel local” and kicked off the series of staycations at Park Inn by Radisson Blu.If you're a shopaholic and a foodie, the hotel’s location is perfect for you as it is connected to a mall.Food is fresh since they harvest it from the “backyard,” and outdoor activities are adrenaline-rushing.From the highlands of Eden Nature Park head to Island Buenavista.Oh, the food is great, too!The island destination also makes for a perfect escape from city life.",1.0,0.791100025177002,"vaccination, duterte, expert, trial, get, approve, emergency_use, first, astrazeneca, pfizer","['davao', 'tourism', 'economy']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,Neutral

But if the private sector’s offer to set up 13 additional sites is added, there would be a total of 40 sites.Residents must register to be vaccinated, either online or in barangay offices.Meanwhile, a cold storage facility is being set up at the Bacolod City Government Center to accommodate about 2 million vaccine doses at a time.After starting the vaccination simulation exercises, the city is now implementing a massive information and awareness campaign to build up public confidence and acceptance of the vaccines.

For Russian citizens, vaccination with Sputnik V will be free of charge.The uniqueness of the Russian vaccine lies in the use of two different vectors based on the human adenovirus, which allows for a stronger and longer-term immune response as compared to vaccines using one and same vector for two doses.Currently, RDIF and partners have launched production of the lyophilized (dry) form of the vaccine, which is stored at a temperature of +2 to +8 degrees Celsius. Such a regime enables the distribution of the vaccine in international markets, as well as expanding its use in hard-to-reach regions, including areas with tropical climates.Current agreements between RDIF and leading foreign pharmaceutical companies allow production of the vaccine abroad for 500 million people per year starting from 2021. RDIF is currently considering additional applications from a number of countries and companies to further increase production capacity.The first foreign deliveries of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine will be made to customers in January 2021 based on existing partnerships with foreign manufacturers. Those customers, who have recently submitted their requests, will be able to receive the first batches of the vaccine starting from March 2021.“We are ready to start deliveries of the Sputnik V vaccine to foreign markets thanks to partnerships with manufacturers in India, Brazil, South Korea, China and four other countries,” said RDIF chief executive officer Kirill Dmitriev.As of November 24, more than 22,000 volunteers were vaccinated with the first dose and more than 19,000 volunteers with the first and the second dose of the vaccine at 29 medical centers in Russia as part of the ongoing clinical trials.Currently, Phase III clinical trials are approved and are ongoing in Belarus, the UAE, Venezuela and other countries, as well as Phase II-III in India.As of November 24, no unexpected adverse events were identified as part of the research. Some of those vaccinated had short-term minor adverse events such as pain at the injection point and flu-like symptoms including fever, weakness, fatigue, and headache.During the clinical trials, the safety of the vaccine is constantly being monitored; information is analyzed by the Independent Monitoring Committee comprising leading Russian scientists. Collection, quality control and data processing is conducted in line with ICH GCP standards and involves the active participation of Moscow’s Health Department and Crocus Medical, the contract research organization (CRO).The safety of vaccines based on human adenoviruses has been confirmed in more than 75 international publications and more than 250 clinical trials conducted during the past two decades - while the history of use of human adenoviruses in vaccine development started in 1953. Adenovirus vectors are genetically modified viruses of the regular flu that cannot reproduce in a human body. When the Sputnik V vaccine is used, the coronavirus itself does not enter the body as the vaccine only contains genetic information about part of its outer protein coat, the so called ""spikes"" forming its crown. This completely eliminates the possibility of getting infected as a result of vaccination while also causing the body's stable immune response.On September 4, The Lancet, one of world’s leading medical journals, published a research paper on the results of Phase I and Phase II clinical trials of the vaccine that showed no serious adverse events and an effective immune response of those vaccinated.Requests for more than 1.2 billion doses of Sputnik V vaccine came from more than 50 countries. The vaccine supplies for the global market will be produced by RDIF’s international partners in India, Brazil, China, South Korea and other countries.On August 11, the Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Center was registered by Russia’s Health Ministry and became the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19.

The recommendation was made by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).The Palace explained that the President agreed to lift the deployment ban of health workers due to the decreasing coronavirus cases and the prospect of a coronavirus vaccine, among others.

Galvez Jr., the chief implementer of the National Action Plan Against COVID-19 (NAP), that the acquisition of the vaccines from international companies, such as Gamaleya, Moderna and Pfizer, would be done by phases.“So ang tanging isyu dito ay dapat maging safe muna bago nila ibigay, walang papayag na magpa-inject kung di sigurado na safe.

The lives of the Filipinos are at stake here, we cannot convince the Filipinos to have it if we are not sure that the vaccine to be injected to them is safe.)“Ito ang napag-usapan namin ni DOH Secretary (Francisco) Duque (III) and Secretary Galvez na kapag nadeklara na itong safe ng FDA, uunahin natin ang mahihirap, uunahin natin ang mga vulnerable,’’ he stressed.

He attributed the vaccine delay to issues related to indemnity and regulatory approval.“We obviously disagree,” Roque said during a televised press briefing Monday, Feb. 22, when asked to comment on Senate Majority Franklin Drilon’s statement that the vaccine delay was due to mismanagement.“Anyway, they are entitled to say what they want pero gaya ng aking sinabi sandali lang po ang kaligayahan ng ating mga kritiko dahil tuloy na po ang ating vaccination program (but like I said, the happiness of the critics will be short-lived because our vaccination program will push through). Enjoy it while it lasts for a very short while,” he added.MismanagementIn an interview over ANC Headstart Monday, Drilon said the delay in the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines was reportedly due to the mismanagement of the procurement process and not because of the lack of an indemnity law.“We have to cue and we are last in the cue because of our failure to make an advance payment early enough. These alleged indemnity agreements are not the cause of these delays,” Drilon said.“The fact that this is only foisted to us last week is an indication that the supply agreement is not the cause of the delays. Unfortunately, I have already seen in the media some blame being put on Congress for failing topass this law. That’s totally unfair,” the minority leader added.“It is the mismanagement of this entire process that caused the delay in our procurement,” he said.Roque said, “‘Yung mga kritiko ng gobyerno, pasensiya na po, talaga pong naantala nang ilang araw pero tuloy na po ang bakuna (To government critics, bear with the slight delay in the vaccine delivery but the vaccination will proceed),” he added.On the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines covered by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) COVAX facility, Roque said the drug manufacturers first wanted an indemnity deal before the supplies are delivered to the country.“Mayroon tayong liham, hindi made-deny ang liham na galing sa COVAX na mid-February darating yung Pfizer at saka AstraZeneca. Kaya lang po may mga natakot na manufacturers dahil dito lang sa Pilipinas nadedemanda ang mga bakuna na naaprubahan hindi lang FDA kung hindi WHO (We received a letter from COVAX facility that stated the delivery of Pfizer and AstraZeneca will begin in mid-February. But the manufacturers got scared because it is only in the Philippines where manufacturers can be sued for vaccines approved not only by (the) FDA but also by (the) WHO),” he said.“Siyempre kailangan nila protektahan ang kanilang interes baka mamaya makulong sila, eh sila na nga gumagawa ng bakuna para sa COVID-19 (Of course, they wanted to protect their interest otherwise they might land in jail even if they developed the vaccines for COVID-19,” he added.The FDA has issued the emergency use authorization (EUA) for the coronavirus vaccines developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech. The vaccineshowever have not been recommended for the use of health workers due toits 50.4 percent efficacy.

How can they say that they will be able to purchase 148 million doses by the end of 2021 when up to now, we haven’t given any Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to any vaccine and we have not been able to raise, through loans, all the needed amount for the purchase of the vaccines?” Drilon said.The minority leader also said he is skeptical over the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) assurance that it is ready to issue an EUA within the week for Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine.FDA Director General Eric Domingo, during the hearing, said Pfizer has applied for an EUA and the agency is expected to issue one in one to two days.“I am not reassured in the slightest by what I heard. To be honest, I am more confused now. The government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan fails to provide the public the assurance they need from the government,” Drilon said.He said vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr.’s statement that 80 percent of the global supply has already been procured by rich countries makes the government’s target of securing millions of doses simply difficult to achieve.“If only the government was able to make advanced purchases last year, similar to other low-and-middle income countries such as Indonesia and Brazil, maybe we would have a better chance of securing these 148 million doses of vaccines this year,” he added.Drilon said the only way the government can achieve its target of inoculating 70 million Filipinos is by allowing the local government units (LGUs) and the private sector to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies for the purchase of the vaccines that they had issued an EUA to.He said this would expedite the purchase of the much-needed vaccines. “I believe there is a consensus among the senators insofar as lifting these restrictions is concerned,” he said.“They have a better chance of achieving the targets if they lift the restriction that they set that prevents local chief executives and the private sector from buying vaccines directly from the manufacturers,” the senator said.The Senate minority chief also said that funding for the procurement of vaccines is not even guaranteed at this point as the government has not fully secured the necessary loans to fund the P70-billion.The government has allotted P82.5-billion for the purchase of the vaccines but only P12.5-billion is in the programmed appropriation.

Joey Sarte Salceda has proposed that President Duterte be given much leeway or specific powers to implement the COVID-19 response and recovery interventions, and expedite the vaccine procurement, importation, and rollout.(Cong. Joey Salceda’s office / FILE PHOTO / )Under his House Bill No. 8285 or the proposed “Bayanihan sa Bakuna Act”, the House leader wanted to eliminate all the roadblocks to vaccine procurement, distribution, and administration to ensure the immediate importation and rollout of the coronavirus vaccines.“I have authored Bayanihan sa Bakuna Act to cut all the red tape and eliminate any further delay in getting the public vaccinated. The vaccines are available. We have the money. We know the costs of delaying the vaccine. So, we must not tolerate any further delay in getting our people vaccinated,” Salceda said in a statement.“All channels – political, diplomatic, commercial – should be used to procure and roll them out expeditiously and without undue delay,” he stressed.In his bill’s explanatory note, Salceda said the costs of each day of not having the vaccine are staggering.According to the co-chairperson of the Economic Cluster of the Defeat COVID-19 Ad hoc panel, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) estimates that every week of enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) or modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) in the National Capital Region (NCR) and its adjacent regions alone shaves off 0.28 percentage points from the gross domestic product (GDP) growth.“This is equivalent to around 2.1 billion pesos in lost wages a day. The amount during GCQ is lower at around 700 million pesos a day, but is nonetheless a major blow to household incomes, particularly during this period of economic hardship, where involuntary hunger has reached unmatched heights in the country’s recent history,” Salceda said.He said the country can no longer absorb the economic losses of any further restriction in economic activity.“This has to end. And there is no better way to end this pandemic than with the quick rollout of the vaccine,” Salceda said.He said under his measure, the President is authorized to exercise the following powers to expedite the procurement and administration of the COVID_19 vaccine and related supplies:-Exempt vaccine procurement from circuitous procurement laws;-Set forth a mandatory vaccination program for health care workers;-Assume health care workers’ medical bills due to COVID-19, including side effects of the vaccine;-Engage the Philippine Red Cross in rolling out the vaccine;-Liberalize the grant of tax incentives for importation of the COVID-19 vaccine;-Create savings from unutilized appropriations, and directs them towards vaccine procurement;-Allocate funds held by GOCCs and national government agencies towards COVID-19 procurement;-Accelerate private sector requests for authorization to import COVID-19 vaccines; and-Facilitate LGU requests to import COVID-19 vaccines, provided that these requests do not compete with the government’s efforts to procure such vaccines.Salceda said his measure also seeks to waive the Phase IV requirement for vaccine approval, under certain conditions.It also authorizes the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve vaccines that have already been tested on Filipinos abroad, he said.“Thousands of nurses in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and the Middle East, are Filipinos. Actually, given that many of these areas manufactured vaccines, our nurses were first in the line for the vaccine there. So, there is no reason to disapprove vaccines that were proven effective for our fellow Filipinos, since the allergy profile should be the same,” he said.Under the bill, the FDA and other relevant agencies are mandated “to expedite authorizations for vaccines for which trials have been conducted successfully on Filipinos without serious adverse effects, as certified by counterparts in other countries.”The measure also empowers the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to explore diplomatic channels to accelerate vaccine procurement.The bill also seeks to identify the sources of funding for vaccine procurement, even as it calls for the creation of a congressional oversight committee to ensure that the Executive faithfully and expeditiously implements the proposed Act.“The vaccines are available.

There is none, your honor, yes,” Angara told Recto.The DILG was given a P5-billion fund under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act to hire and train 50,000 contact tracers and augment the personnel employed by the government to track down close contacts of COVID-19 patients. It said it so far hired 46,338.For their 2021 budget, however, Angara said the DILG did not request for continued appropriation for the program.Speaking for DILG Secretary Eduardo Año who was in the Senate plenary, Angara said the agency does not intend to totally abandon it and will continue to supervise the contact tracing activities of the local government units (LGUs), the police, and the Bureau of Fire Protection.He also said that the DILG hopes that the additional contact tracers it hired under the Bayanihan 2 would be absorbed by LGUs so they can continue to do their work.But Recto doubted that LGUs will still have funds to pay for the services of the contact tracers, saying that they have already spent a significant amount for their constituents during the pandemic, and the calamities that hit their areas this year.“Let’s say, the province of Batangas, kasi tinamaan din ng Taal Volcano ‘yan (which was affected by eruption of the Taal Volcano), so their local government revenues next year will be less tha this year, including local revenues because of the pandemic.

Sapagkat hindi natin pupwedeng isubo ‘yung kaning mainit na iluluwa lang ng tao (Free.

Lawrence Fortun welcomed on Tuesday the signing of the Alternative Learning System (ALS) Act, which he envisions to be useful even with the future rollout of anti-COVID vaccines.(PIXABAY / FILE PHOTO / )“Given recent developments, it does not look like we will see most students returning to their classrooms. Therefore, ALS modes will still be needed in school year 2021-2022,” Fortun said in a statement.“At best, the older students—those from Grade 9 to Grade 12 and those in college—would have the best chances of returning to classrooms if they are vaccinated within this year. According to the disclosures and data of the vaccine manufacturers, their vaccines are not yet recommended for children. The youngest ages they suggested for vaccination are in the 15 to 18 (age groups),” he noted.Fortun was a member of the House contingent in the Bicameral Conference Committee on the ALS Act, which was reported to have signed into law by President Duterte Monday. The law was designated as Republic Act (RA) 11510.“I thank President Rodrigo Duterte for signing into law these important reforms and milestone in alternative learning system. The law provides for bridging mechanism for ALS completers to higher education,” he said.He said the new ALS law gives the Department of Education (DepEd) strong legal basis to make all the needed changes to its delivery modes while online class continue under the new normal.Fortun said the ALS law had been pursued since the 15th Congress, but measures on it only prospered in the current 18th Congress after the COVID-19 pandemic made face-to-face classes for pupils untenable due to health risks.“Availment of the DepEd ALS or Alternative Learning System and lifelong education services is for free. The newly-signed ALS Law guarantees that all DepEd ALS programs are free and there shall be no solicitation or payments for any fees as a requisite for admission,” he explained.He said that while DepEd has been practicing ALS for decades, there has been a growing need to update the system via legislation.“Different ways of non-formal education shall be used to implement ALS, not just through online/ digital blended learning. The implementation modes depend on the situation of the learners. It is the DepEd that will adjust to the learner’s needs, not the learner adjusting to the DepEd,” Fortun said.The Philippines, unlike countries in the West, has yet to launch mass immunization efforts against the 2019 coronavirus.

Hindi po ‘yan absolute. ‘Yung mga tokens pinapayagan naman lalo na kung panahon ng Pasko. Puwede pong tokens, ‘yung mga wala masyadong halaga ibig sabihin (I am a lawyer. That is not absolute. The tokens are allowed especially during Christmas. Tokens or those with small value are allowed),” Roque said during a televised press briefing.Roque was reacting to queries if there was any breach of the anti-graft law in accepting COVID-19 vaccines donated to the President’s security team.Asked if the vaccines are considered tokens, Roque said: “I don’t think it’s of much value anyway.”He found nothing wrong with accepting small tokens especially during special occasions.“So ‘yung mga little value sa mga special occasion. I’m not arguing. So ‘yun lang nakasaad sa batas but it is not an absolute ban (So those with little value during special occasions. I’m not arguing. That’s what the law says but it is not an absolute ban),” he said.“Kung ganyan, ‘yung aking birthday cake na natanggap sa mga tauhan, that constitutes graft and corruption. Hindi naman po. ‘Yun mga of little value (If that’s the case, the birthday cake I received from my staff would constitute graft and corruption. It’s not. As long as they have little value),” he said.Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act prohibits public officers from “directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any gift, present, share, percentage, or benefit, for himself or for any other person, in connection with any contract or transaction between the government and any other party.”It also declares unlawful the “directly or indirectly requesting or receiving any gift, present or other pecuniary or material benefit, for himself or for another, from any person for whom the public officer, in any manner or capacity, has secured or obtained, or will secure or obtain, any Government permit or license, in consideration for the help given or to be given.”The same law however excludes “unsolicited gifts or presents of small or insignificant value offered or given as a mere ordinary token of gratitude or friendship according to local customs or usage.”PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III earlier confirmed that PSG personnel providing close-in security to the President have been inoculated with the COVID vaccine in line with its mission to protect the country’s leader.

Manila led the way in the formal vaccination roll out of the first batch of the anti-COVID-19 vaccines that arrived in the country.It was held at the Philippine General Hospital, where PGH Director Gap Legaspi himself became the first recipient of the Coronavac made and donated by China’s SinovacBiotech.Later during the day, Manila was fortunate enough to receive 3,000 Coronavac vaccines from the national government and for this, we profusely thank President Rodrigo Duterte, National Task Force (NTF) Deputy Chief Implementer and Testing Czar Vince Dizon, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr.,Department of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and the DOH family for being highly instrumental in the donation of vaccines given to the city.My ever-supportive Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna, who also happens to be a doctor, was among those who got vaccinated at the Sta. Ana Hospital where we received the vaccines and had them put immediately at our storage facility.Manila Health Department head Dr. Poks Pangan and Sta. Ana Hosptial Director Dr. Grace Padilla, as well as our Manila Infectious Disease Control Center head Dr. Nerissa Sescon, also took the jab and led the event to encourage other medical frontliners to follow suit and erase their hesitation.Much as I would also very much want to get vaccinated, we are adhering to the rules accompanying the donated vaccines which prioritizes the health frontliners as beneficiaries.As of this writing, the vaccines donated by the national government have all been administered to our health frontliners, all in just a matter of days and for this, I thank and commend the MHD personnel who carried out the entire vaccination program successfully and without hitches. We were also able to administer the vaccines to health frontliners from private hospitals and clinics on top of those from our public hospitals.Our many past simulation exercises of our vaccination program really paid off. Proudly, we were able to conclude the entire vaccination processes without any hitches, except for one vial that was found to be broken when our personnel opened the box in which it was put.So far too, no adverse effects were recorded among those who received the initial batch of vaccines.Now, the bad news. The current COVID-19 situation in Manila is very, very alarming. Imagine, 196 positive cases were recorded in just a single day last March 4.This is a first in recent months.Equally alarming is the fact that the occupancy rate of our six city-run hospitals is at 36 percent. Of the city’s 300-bed capacity, the total occupied is 108.At our quarantine facilities, the occupancy rate is at an all-time high of 61 percent.For the 371 bed capacity, the number of patients is 225.The record-high of 196 cases in one day was confirmed by the city government’s own RT-PCR testing that continues to be given for free to those who need it.The surprising spike in the number of persons getting infected is a serious cause for alarm, not only for us in the city government but equally, for the citizens of Manila, although the same thing is happening all over the country right now.The local government will never succeed in any of its efforts to fight COVID-19 without the active participation of Manilans themselves and as always, I appeal for voluntary or self-discipline.I also will not get tired of repeating over and over again my call for all to never, ever let their guard down. Continue practicing the basic, minimum health protocols —wear your masks, wash your hands and watch your distance—at all times.Also, I encourage all of our residents to grab the opportunity to get vaccinated once the opportunity presents itself. Without the vaccine, we are a hundred percent at risk of getting infected and even dying from the coronavirus while with the vaccine, the risk of turning into a severe case is lessened to a great degree due to the protection thatthe vaccines provide.***Gaya ng paulit-ulitkong sinasabi, kailangan ko ang tulong ninyong lahat.

Florida Robes lauded government movesin addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, saying that such efforts have been commended by other countries.Dr. Aleli Annie Grace Sudiacal, representing the Department of Health’s Bureau of International Health Cooperation, disclosed that President Duterte has already approved the use of P2.5 billion in order to vaccinate some 22 million Filipinos for COVID-19 should one be made available.Appearing during the recent virtual committee meeting of the people participation panel, Sudiacal said that the President has already given his approval to use the P2.5 billion allotted for the purchase of COVID-19 under the proposed 2021 General Appropriations Act through the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility.The House panel has been conducting meetings in a bid to coordinate and facilitate efforts in the development of vaccine for COVID-19.Sudiacal explained that COVAX facility, organized by the World Health Organization,is a global sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of vaccines once they are licensed and approved. It is expected to provide vaccination for 3 to 20 percent of the population or 3.2 million to 22 million Filipinos.According to her the COVAX facility pools together the world’s philanthropists, international non-governmental organizations and other groups to be able to talk to manufacturers to produce vaccines based on the need of a country, regardless of their economic standing. “This way we will be assured that manufacturers will produce the amount needed to vaccinate this eligible population,” she said.She added that the Philippines is eligible under the COVAX system because it is a low middle income country which signified its intention to be part of the system.

This would be a great moral and social tragedy,” it said.Medical frontliners should be the top priority for immunization, the CBCP said, as the country needs “healthy doctors and nurses to treat our sick so that our people can heal.”Adults who are at high risk for severe disease due to their age or underlying medical conditions should be next to receive a vaccine, the prelates said. “We especially need to shield our senior citizens who face the highest risk of death from COVID-19,” they said.Third to prioritize should be essential workers “whose roles are inherently risky because of necessary interactions with the public,” the CBCP said.These include teachers, grocery store workers, public transportation workers, police, firefighters, and national security personnel, among others, it said.Individuals who are living in “dense urban areas where they are vulnerable to the virus” should also be prioritized, the prelates said.“We urge our national government to provide the COVID-19 vaccine to everyone without cost to the individual. Otherwise it will not be available to the poor,” the CBCP said.The government should be transparent and ensure the welfare of those who will volunteer to participate in any clinical trials for COVID-19 candidate vaccines, the CBCP said.By doing so, this will help bolster “public confidence in the initiatives of medical and governmental authorities,” it said.“We remind our public health authorities and the pharmaceutical companies involved that these COVID-19 vaccine Phase III clinical trials must be conducted adhering to the highest ethical standards and best scientific practices,” the CBCP said.“Full transparency is critical at every step of the development and distribution of a candidate vaccine to ensure the safety and effectiveness of every approved vaccine in an immunization campaign,” it added.Before any Phase III clinical trial commences, the results of the Phase I and II clinical trials of candidate vaccines should be first evaluated by designated ethics and expert panels and approved by our national regulatory agencies, the CBCP said.“The data should be made publicly available so that other scientists and medical professionals can confirm the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine,” it said.“Every participant in these clinical trials must be guaranteed the highest possible standard of care if they experience any adverse reactions. In the case of unforeseen permanent bodily damage, or even death, compensation to the participant or family would be just,” it added.The findings of the Phase III clinical trials must be made public, regardless of outcome, the CBCP said.“It is our prayer that the clinical trials conducted in our country will benefit the global effort to end the pandemic,” it said.

Once magkaroon na ng talagang… kung ilan ang i-allocate sa atin, magkakaroon na ng pirmahan.

Once we already determine how many (doses) they are willing to allocate to us, there will be a signing of an agreement. Hopefully, the earliest is within this month or first week of January (2021) if there is a delay in the allocation),” he said.The controversy stemmed from the revelation of Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.last week that the plan to secure Pfizer’s vaccine by January was foiled after “someone dropped the ball” during the negotiations. He did not drop any names.But Sen. Panfilo Lacson bared that Locsin was referring to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III after Duquesupposedly failed to submit “on time” a confidentiality disclosure agreement (CDA) to Pfizer.The CDA will ensure that some critical information about Pfizer’s vaccines will not be divulged to the public while certain evaluation processes are still ongoing.Galvez defended Duque from criticisms that his supposed negligence led to the fallout of the government and Pfizer’s negotiations which, according to the vaccine czar, started in the middle part of the year.Galvez bared that the government has been talking with Pfizer as early as August or September for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines but there were some “roadblocks” that were encountered by both parties.Among the roadblocks were the lack of data about the efficacy of Pfizer at the time and the need to store the vaccine in extremely cold temperatures.“Noong panahon na iyon, maraming uncertainties kasi ‘yung platform ng Pfizer ay hindi pa ginagamit sa mga vaccine. ‘Yun ang block at napakataas ng requirement sa logistics (During that time, there were a lot of uncertainties because the platform of Pfizer was not yet used in the vaccines. That was the roadblock and the high requirements in the logistics),” Galvez said.“‘Yung nangyayaring negotiation sa Pfizer ay ongoing po at hindi po tayo bumitaw. Hindi po natin nabitawan ang bola kundi ipinasa lang sa akin (The negotiation with Pfizer is currently ongoing and we did not let go. Nobody dropped the ball but it was passed to me),” he added.Galvez urged all stakeholders to stop making “unfounded accusations and unnecessary noise” which may derail the government from pursuing its goal of securing a safe and effective vaccine.“The ball is being passed not because there are those who are abrogating responsibility but because we want it to reach the goal – to close deals and obtain vaccines for all Filipinos so that we can implement our national vaccination program at the most appropriate time,” he said.Pfizer is at the forefront of the vaccine race as it reported that its candidate vaccine yielded 95-percent efficacy in its Phase 3 trials. The United States government already issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Pfizer to allow its vaccine to be used for public consumption.Galvez assured that the government is “determined” to acquire safe and effective vaccines for all Filipinos “regardless of brand or their country of origin.”The government is planning to inoculate 60 to 70 percent of the total population, or about 70 million Filipinos, to achieve herd immunity and as part of the National Vaccine Roadmap to eradicate the threat of COVID-19.“With this as our guiding principle, it is our duty as public servants to carefully study and evaluate all documents relative to the procurement and acquisition of candidate vaccines, especially when the public health and safety are at stake. As we take responsibility for our actions, we cannot afford to engage in finger-pointing or buck-passing at this crucial stage. These kinds of discussions are unproductive and will only distract us from carrying out our crucial mandate,” he said.Galvez said all the decisions and actions that the government has made were done “in accordance with the careful process of scientific evaluation and selection” of the Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP), which evaluates the vaccine candidates that want to enter the country.“The process of selection is based on safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, the track record of the vaccine maker, complexity of handling and logistics, after-sales and life cycle services, production capacity and early delivery, and long-term commitment,” he said. “Let me reiterate, no ‘bus’ was missed or no ‘ball’ was dropped because we are focused on our main goal and that is to secure an equitable share of the vaccines,” he added.

Would you take it if it was offered to you today?,Dr. Edsel Salvana,"December 16, 2020, 2:31 PM","CLINICAL MATTERSDr. Edsel Maurice T. SalvanaIt was the “shot” that was seen and heard around the world. On Dec. 8, the first-ever approved Covid-19 vaccine was given to a 90-year-old woman in the UK named Maggie. This became the first of many more vaccinations, marking a momentous shift in the battle against Covid-19.The road to the Covid-19 vaccine was far from certain. Many doubted that a safe and effective vaccine could be produced in less than a year. The fastest time to develop a vaccine was four years. That was for the mumps vaccine. The preclinical and clinical studies encompassing phase 1 to phase 3 clinical trials of vaccine development are daunting. As pointed out by many scientists, though, the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not start from scratch. This was not a rushed process. This vaccine has been in development for the past 17 years.When the original SARS coronavirus epidemic occurred in 2002, there was a rush to identify its weak spots. One of its vulnerabilities is its spike protein, the little knobs that give the coronavirus its distinctive appearance. Spike protein enables the virus to attack and enter human cells. The 2002 SARS outbreak fortunately fizzled out, but this meant that no vaccines could be clinically evaluated. With no more active infections, vaccines could no longer be tested.A Covid 19 vaccine candidate at the Sinovac Biotech facilities in Beijing(Nicolas Asfouri)When MERS emerged in 2012, there was renewed interest in developing a coronavirus vaccine. A lot of the vaccine knowledge developed for SARS was utilized to develop a vaccine for MERS. Again, the outbreak ended before clinical trials could begin. There is still some low-level transmission occurring sporadically among camel handlers in Saudi Arabia, but these are not enough to properly evaluate a vaccine. The effort to prove efficacy in humans was shelved. The SARS outbreak followed by the MERS outbreak a decade later led scientists to correctly deduce the arrival of yet another coronavirus. Scientists continued the laboratory work in hopes of being ready when the next outbreak occurred.This foresight proved serendipitous. When Chinese scientists published the full genome of the novel coronavirus in January 2020, vaccine researchers from all over the world were ready. What followed was one of the most remarkable feats in the history of science and medicine. With international cooperation, several vaccines progressed from early phase I and II clinical trials to phase III clinical trials in just a few months. Vaccine after vaccine seemed promising as they hurdled the early phases, and doctors and scientists held their collective breaths as the progress seemed too good to be true. The US FDA set its target for approving a vaccine at 50 percent efficacy, which is a very low target. Setting the bar this low was a nod to the uncertainty surrounding this endeavor. When the data from the first phase 3 trial was reported by Pfizer, the results were stunning.The Pfizer/BioNTechtwo-dose vaccine showed a 95 percent efficacy for prevention of Covid-19 infection among patients who had never been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Efficacy after only one dose was more than 52 percent. Just as encouraging, it showed an 89 percent efficacy for prevention of severe infection. Overall, the results from this first-ever Covid-19 vaccine exceeded the most optimistic expectations. This vaccine and the others that follow is the beginning of the end for the pandemic.Shortly after the Pfizer announcement, other pharmaceutical companies announced their interim phase 3 trial results. Moderna, Astra/Zeneca, and Sinopharm released vaccine efficacy figures ranging from 70 percent to 95 percent.These phase 3 trials need to be completed with at least two months of safety data, but there is every reason to be optimistic that the data will be similar to the Pfizer/BioNTechexperience. The Moderna vaccine, which is also an RNA vaccine like that of Pfizer/BioNTech, has so far shown a 95 percent efficacy for preventing symptomatic Covid-19, and 100 percent efficacy for prevention of severe Covid-19. More interim results from other vaccine studies will soon be released, and there is good reason to hope that many more effective vaccines will be available by the first quarter of 2021.The Pfizer FDA application states that there are adverse events from the vaccine, but most of these are mild and tolerable. Some clinical trial participants reported injection-site discomfort and flu-like symptoms, but the overall safety data between the vaccine recipients and the placebo control were similar. Recent reports of severe allergic reactions in two healthcare workers who had a history of severe allergies prompted the UK health authorities to caution people with a history of severe allergies against receiving the vaccine.Since people who had a history of severe allergies were excluded from the clinical trials, this precaution is prudent while the manufacturer and health authorities investigate the circumstances surrounding the events. They did not suspend administration of the vaccine in otherwise healthy people.As more vaccines are released for use, more of these reactions or adverse events are expected, as is usual with new drugs. Safety data are continuously collected among those who were enrolled in the original clinical trials. The large number of subjects enrolled in these clinical trials means that any severe reaction that was missed would be very rare, with a less than one in 10,000 probability of occurrence. These rarer adverse events, if any, can be captured with good phase 4 post-marketing surveillance by manufacturers and health authorities.I get repeatedly asked whether I would take the vaccine if it were offered to me today. As long as it is a properly approved vaccine proven to be safe and efficacious, I would not hesitate to take it. As a healthcare worker and frontliner, I am much more concerned about contracting Covid-19 that can kill me or my loved ones than the possibility of rare side effects. Covid-19 is a clear and present danger to us all, and vaccines are a way out of the constant fear of infection. I would recommend it to my parents and my in-laws who are in their 70s and their 80s respectively. I would give it to my kids once clinical data for children are available. I can’t wait for my kids to go back to physical school again. I want to be free of the constant fear that I may bring home something deadly from work. Vaccination will allow us to be with friends and family again. Vaccination will restore that most important of human experiences, the ability to touch each other and hold those closest to us.

Lina,"August 17, 2020, 11:00 PM","FINDING ANSWERSFormer Senator Atty. Joey LinaSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious.It’s one of the longest words in the English language and it may mean something so wonderful and extremely good. Being so, one may relate it to the awaited coronavirus vaccine being developed — the long road towards something so extraordinarily beneficial to mankind now virtually paralyzed by the pandemic.I had an enlightening talk in my Teleradyo program last Sunday with former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral who described the arduous process in the frantic search around the world for a safe and effective vaccine which many hope would be the magic bullet to defeat COVID-19 and bring forth economic recovery.While many vaccines for other illnesses took 10 to 15 years to develop, with the fastest at 4 years (for mumps), the world’s scientists and the entire pharmaceutical industry are now racing to develop within a year’s time the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.It’s possible to come up with such vaccine in less than a year, Dr. Cabral said, using a mix of new technologies and experience. Indeed, many reports point out massive efforts of research scientists have been “accelerated considerably by acquired knowledge developed during the generation of candidate vaccines for related SARS and MERS coronaviruses, as well as recent research into Ebola vaccines.”Still, despite the urgent need to come up soonest with a product that protects against COVID-19 and its transmission, a vaccine must go through multiple stages — consisting of initial research and development, followed by a series of pre-clinical and clinical trials — before being approved for use by the general population.The pre-clinical trial stage is when the vaccine is administered to animals to see if an immune response is triggered and to see how safe it is. But there are reports that for some coronavirus vaccines, “researchers have been able to speed up normal protocol by testing animals and humans in parallel.”Dr. Cabral described the clinical trials which consist of three phases. In the first phase, the vaccine is given to a small group of volunteers, usually from 10 to 50 people. The second phase covers several hundred people, while the third and last stage consists of thousands or even tens of thousands of various ages in various locations.All three phases are administered to determine the vaccine’s potential side-effects, immune response, dosage required, and to further gauge its safety, of course.The US biotechnology firm Moderna was first in the world to start human trials last March 16, according to a CNN report last week. “Now there are six vaccines in the last stage of human trials (Phase 3) before they seek approval: Three from China — two developed by state-owned Sinopharm and one from private Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech; one from the United Kingdom produced in partnership between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca; and two from the US, one by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, in addition to the candidate by Moderna,” the report said.But the first country to declare it had registered a vaccine and approved it for use is Russia, with President Vladimir Putin saying that one of his daughters had been inoculated. He said the vaccine, called “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was first launched into space, “works quite effectively, forms strong immunity… and has passed all the needed checks.”However, the vaccine’s development process has raised concerns because, apart from being approved in Russia without undergoing the Phase 3 trial, no data on Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted by the state-run Gamaleya Research Institute have been subjected to peer review.The Philippines will join Russia’s Phase 3 trial to be conducted from October, 2020, to March next year, according to Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of Department of Science and Technology Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), who said around a thousand healthy Filipinos from areas with high COVID-19 transmission will be selected.Those joining clinical trials are not paid, according to Dr. Cabral. But they will be compensated for time lost from their work. They will be covered by medical insurance to ensure free treatment if they get sick and there will be compensation for deaths resulting from the trial.But it remains to be seen how Filipinos would be willing to be part of the Russian Phase 3 trial amid President Duterte’s declaration that he wants to be a volunteer.Email: finding.lina@yahoo.com ",manilabulletin,2020-08-17 23:00:00,"FINDING ANSWERSFormer Senator Atty.Being so, one may relate it to the awaited coronavirus vaccine being developed — the long road towards something so extraordinarily beneficial to mankind now virtually paralyzed by the pandemic.I had an enlightening talk in my Teleradyo program last Sunday with former Health Secretary Esperanza Cabral who described the arduous process in the frantic search around the world for a safe and effective vaccine which many hope would be the magic bullet to defeat COVID-19 and bring forth economic recovery.While many vaccines for other illnesses took 10 to 15 years to develop, with the fastest at 4 years (for mumps), the world’s scientists and the entire pharmaceutical industry are now racing to develop within a year’s time the vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.It’s possible to come up with such vaccine in less than a year, Dr. Cabral said, using a mix of new technologies and experience.But there are reports that for some coronavirus vaccines, “researchers have been able to speed up normal protocol by testing animals and humans in parallel.”Dr.In the first phase, the vaccine is given to a small group of volunteers, usually from 10 to 50 people.“Now there are six vaccines in the last stage of human trials (Phase 3) before they seek approval: Three from China — two developed by state-owned Sinopharm and one from private Chinese firm Sinovac Biotech; one from the United Kingdom produced in partnership between the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca; and two from the US, one by pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, in addition to the candidate by Moderna,” the report said.But the first country to declare it had registered a vaccine and approved it for use is Russia, with President Vladimir Putin saying that one of his daughters had been inoculated.He said the vaccine, called “Sputnik V” after the Soviet-era satellite that was first launched into space, “works quite effectively, forms strong immunity… and has passed all the needed checks.”However, the vaccine’s development process has raised concerns because, apart from being approved in Russia without undergoing the Phase 3 trial, no data on Phase 1 and 2 trials conducted by the state-run Gamaleya Research Institute have been subjected to peer review.The Philippines will join Russia’s Phase 3 trial to be conducted from October, 2020, to March next year, according to Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of Department of Science and Technology Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), who said around a thousand healthy Filipinos from areas with high COVID-19 transmission will be selected.Those joining clinical trials are not paid, according to Dr. Cabral.They will be covered by medical insurance to ensure free treatment if they get sick and there will be compensation for deaths resulting from the trial.But it remains to be seen how Filipinos would be willing to be part of the Russian Phase 3 trial amid President Duterte’s declaration that he wants to be a volunteer.Email: finding.lina@yahoo.com",1.0,0.7221999764442444,"vaccination, duterte, expert, trial, get, approve, emergency_use, first, astrazeneca, pfizer","['intricate', 'path']",0.1531,0.0,0.385,0.615,0.0,Positive

A waiver of right will be signed by the beneficiary if he or she declines the free vaccine, he added.The issue on vaccine rights was recently discussed by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).“Napag-usapan na ‘yan. Hindi pa covered ng IATF resolution pero parang mayroon ng consensus. Wala pong pilian, wala kasing pilitan (It has been discussed. It is not yet covered in an IATF resolution but there appears to be a consensus. They cannot choose which brand because they are not forced to be vaccinated),” Roque said during a televised press briefing when asked if Filipinos can choose the vaccines purchased by the government.If a beneficiary refuses to take the free vaccine, Roque said the person must sign a waiver that will renounce his or her priority status for free vaccination. He admitted that people could not afford to be picky when it comes to vaccines since many others want to get inoculated against the virus.“Pero magsa-sign ka ng waiver na hindi ka nagpaturok. At kapag ikaw ay merong prayoridad, siyempre mawawala ang prayoridad mo. Sasama ka doon sa the rest of taumbayan na nag-aantay ng bakuna (But you will sign a waiver that you will not be vaccinated. And once you decline, you will lose your priority status. You will join the rest of the people waiting for the vaccine),” he said.“Tama lang naman po ‘yan. Walang pilian kasi hindi naman natin makokontrol talaga kung ano ang darating at libre po ito. Pero ganun po ‘yan there is such a thing as waiver of a right. Totoo po, meron tayong lahat karapatan para sa mabuting kalusugan pero hindi pupuwede na pihikan dahil napakadaming Pilipino na dapat turukan (It is only right. We cannot choose because we cannot control which vaccines will arrive first and besides, these are free. But there is such a thing as waiver of a right. It is true that we all have the right to good health but we cannot be picky because many Filipinos need to be vaccinated),” he added.Under the government’s free vaccination plan, frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens and other seniors, indigent population, and uniformed personnel will be the first to get inoculated against the virus. The priority areas for the immunization drive are National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Region 11 (Davao region), and Region 4-A (Calabarzon).Earlier, Roque announced the government has secured 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from China’s Sinovac that will be delivered this year. The initial shipment of 50,000 doses will arrive next month.

Mike Defensor Sunday, as the very promising Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is beginning to make waves abroad, particularly in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada where it has been approved for use.( FILE PHOTO)“For now, the vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE cannot be used in individuals younger than 16-years-old, based on our comprehensive review of the EUAs (emergency use authorizations) issued by pharmaceutical regulators in the three countries,” Defensor said.“The use of the vaccine in pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding is also either totally not recommended, or being discouraged with stern warnings,” Defensor, a Health committee vice chairman, also said.“We expect our own Food and Drug Administration here to affirm the same recommendations – once the vaccine gets an EUA here – simply because the safety and efficacy of the shots in children under 16, pregnant women, and mothers who are breastfeeding has yet to established by further clinical trials,” he said.The House leadership said it’s plausible that the same recommendations would apply to all newly developed COVID-19 vaccines that would eventually obtain EUAs in the Philippines.Defensor’s assessment came just as the Philippines is expected to undergo a “baby boom” owing to lockdowns and strict stay-at-home orders as a result of the pandemic.The Commission on Population and Development said the country will record two million pregnancies this year, some 214,000 of which are unplanned.Defensor said that in Britain, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is “absolutely not recommended for use in pregnant women and mothers who are breastfeeding.”“In fact, under their immunization guidelines, in all women of child-bearing age, pregnancy has to be ruled out first prior to vaccination. Women of child-bearing age are also being told to avoid pregnancy for at least two months after their second dose of the vaccine,” he said.The vaccine is meant to be administered intramuscularly in the arm in a series of two doses 21 days apart.“It is unknown whether the vaccine is excreted in human milk, and risks to newborns and infants cannot be excluded. Thus, in Britain, they are not recommending the shots during breastfeeding,” Defensor said.Meanwhile, having a clear budget for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccines should be the government’s top priority to address the public health crisis, Vice President Leni Robredo’s spokesperson said Sunday.Speaking on Robredo’s weekly radio show, Barry Gutierrez said he was surprised over the lack of a definite source of funds to immunize millions of Filipinos next year.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon hadclaimed the P72.5 billion earmarked for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget is like an “unfunded check.”Under the P4.5-trillion national budget for next year, only P2.5 billion out of the P72.5 billion vaccine allocation is funded.The remaining P70 billion, according to Drilon, is allocated under the “unprogrammed funds” provision of the 2021 General Appropriations Bill (GAB) which the Senate and the House ratified last week.“‘Di ba dapat iyan ang una nating tinitiyak na mayroon tayong pondo lalo na itong bakuna. Narinig ko na sinabi ng Pangulo ito ilang beses na sa dulo ang pinakasolusyon lang sa COVID – bakuna,” he said.(Shouldn’t the first thing we make sure is we have funds especially for the vaccines. I heard the President said this a few times the best solution to COVID at the end is vaccine)“Kung anong pera mayroon tayo dapat diyan agad ilagay ‘yan. Bakit mo ilalagay sa ibang ahensya? Ito ‘yung pinakaimportante,” Gutierrez added.(We should put whatever funds we have for that. Why would you allocate it to other agencies? This is the most important)Robredo’s spokesman lamented the administration’s “lack of sense of urgency” in securing COVID-19 vaccines supply when there is a global race to buy the vaccines.“Nagtataka ako bakit parang hindi pa tayo masyadong kumikilos (I’m wondering why we haven’t taken much action),” he said. “Hindi nga tayo nagbayad ng reservation fee (We haven’t paid yet the reservation fee).” (With a report from Raymund F.

This comes amid reports of a crackdown on vials of counterfeit coronavirus jabs from China.“Meron nang pakikipag-ugnayan ang FDA, ang ating Bureau of Customs na talagang susuriing maiigi itong mga dokumento ng mga bakunang darating, at magkakaroon pa po sila ng orientation patungkol dito,” said Secretary Francisco Duque III when asked if the Department of Health has already put in place measures to bar the entry and proliferation of bogus Covid-19 vaccines in the country.
(There’s already coordination between our FDA and our Bureau of Customs to really scrutinize the documents of arriving vaccines and for them to have orientation regarding this matter.)
“At ako naman ay nakakasiguro na itong mga pekeng bakuna na ito — ay harinawa ay ‘di makapasok at kung saka-sakali naman makapasok — ‘don pa lang sa border controls natin ay talagang mapigilan na at maimbestigahan at makasuhan ang mga salarin, so ‘yan po ang pinaghahandaan,” he added.
(As for me, I’m assured that these fake vaccines — hopefully, won’t be able to infiltrate and if ever it does — we can intercept immediately at our border controls and investigate and prosecute perpetrators. That’s what’s being prepared for.)
On Tuesday, China’s state news agency Xinhua said more than 80 people were arrested in different police operations conducted in Beijing, Shanghai, and the eastern province of Shandong where 3,000 doses of false vaccines were seized.
Further reports have shown that the sinister scheme has been going on since September 2020.According to the news report, the fake vaccines only contained saline — a solution of water and salt.
The suspects appeared to have been sending the sham vaccines overseas.

https://business.inquirer.net/318309/adb-poor-infrastructure-seen-to-slow-covid-19-vaccination-in-rural-ph,ADB: Poor infrastructure seen to slow Covid-19 vaccination in rural PH,Ben O. de Vera,"03:44 PM February 23, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — Poor infrastructure and the lack of cold storage facilities in the countryside would slow down the Philippines’ vaccination program, which targets to inoculate the entire population by 2023, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Tuesday.
Citing earlier projections from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), ADB said in a report that it would take the Philippines up to the fourth quarter of 2023 to finish vaccinating the rest of its population after prioritizing vulnerable groups.Compared to other Asean countries, vaccination rollout in the Philippines would lag behind Singapore’s plan to finish inoculation by the fourth quarter of this year, Vietnam’s by the second quarter of next year, Brunei Darussalam and Thailand in the third quarter of 2022, Malaysia in the second quarter of 2023, and Indonesia by the third quarter of 2023.
The Philippines’ timetable to vaccinate the entire population was the same as in Bangladesh, Nepal, Samoa, and Tonga.

Poorer Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste may take up to 2024 or beyond to vaccinate all of their respective populations.
“In the Philippines, it is difficult to access rural and remote communities due to unpredictable weather, security concerns, and poor infrastructure. Inadequate provision of transportation has seen health care workers resort to hiring private motorcycles and pump boats to deliver and administer vaccines,” the ADB brief titled “Getting Ready for the COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout” read.
“Refrigerators in health centers in rural areas are subject to intermittent power supply with no backup power source. Vaccine wastage also occurs owing to a lack of skilled personnel,” it added.
Citing 2020 data by logistics firm DHL, ADB said cold chain logistics in the Philippines scored four out of five as the highest score in terms of preparedness for facilities that required conventional temperature requirements or about 2-8 degrees Celsius, which AstraZeneca vaccines, for instance, needed as storage temperature.
But in case vaccines needed stringent temperature requirements of as low as negative 80 degrees Celsius, cold chain facilities in the Philippines scored only two out of five. Pfizer vaccines, in particular, need to be stored at as low as negative 70 degrees Celsius.
In an earlier report, ADB said the Philippines faced constraints in vaccine financing as “the government estimates that P82.5 billion (about $1.7 billion) will be required to provide vaccines to approximately 55 percent of the country’s population—still short of its plan to vaccinate all Filipinos by 2023.”
Citing the vaccine allocation plan prepared by the Department of Health (DOH), ADB had said the Philippine government targeted to vaccinate 25.35 million Filipinos in 2021, 44.63 million in 2022, and 41.77 million in 2023 since by that time the Philippines would have a total population of 112.89 million.To help buy vaccines, ADB earlier realigned $25 million out of its $125-million health system enhancement to address and limit (Heal) COVID-19 project loan extended in August last year so the Philippines can settle $50 million in advance payments in January this year for six vaccine supply agreements.
In all, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) last December released to DOH P2.76 billion or $55 million from two earlier loans renegotiated with the ADB and the World Bank.
Together with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which would chip-in $300 million, the ADB’s $400-million contribution to the second health system enhancement to address and limit Covid-19 (Heal 2) will finance the bulk of the $764.17-million project cost mainly to procure Covid-19 vaccines, the Inquirer reported last week.
Together with the forthcoming World Bank loan amounting to $500 million, the three multilateral lenders would inject a total of $1.2 billion into the Philippines’ nationwide vaccination program upon approval by their respective boards all expected in March.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1396217/duterte-urged-to-certify-indemnity-fund-bill-for-covid-19-vaccines-as-urgent,Duterte urged to certify indemnity fund bill for COVID-19 vaccines as urgent,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,"02:58 AM February 16, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — Cabinet members have asked President Rodrigo Duterte to certify as urgent a bill seeking to establish an indemnity fund for those getting COVID-19 vaccines, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said on Monday.In the president’s pre-recorded briefing that aired late at night, Galvez, who heads the government‘s vaccination program, said the speed of the procurement was now in the hands of the Senate — particularly Senate President Vicente Sotto III and Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, chair of the Committee on Health and Demography.
“That’s why we have a communication, Mr. President, that these bills should be certified as urgent. That’s our recommendation,” Galvez said in Filipino.
Duterte responded by asking for the documents.
Go, who was present during Duterte’s briefing, also said that the bill had already reached the committee level.
“Secretary Galvez and I have talked so that you can certify it as urgent this week,” Go told Duterte.
The bills will create clauses in agreements between the government and pharmaceutical companies that will indemnify vaccine recipients in case they experience adverse effects.
Galvez said he had requested Sotto and Go to prioritize the indemnification clause, along with the approval of local government units of advance market commitment on the vaccines.
Last Jan. 26, Sen. Nancy Binay filed Senate Bill No. 2015 seeking to put up the indemnification fund that will be subsidized by pharmaceutical companies supplying the government with vaccines.
In turn, the government would craft a set of guidelines and an agreement, which would be required before it formally accepts the vaccines.Although the bill has not been approved, Galvez said immunization could start sometime late in February or in March — when the first batch of one to three million doses of vaccines are expected to arrive.
According to Galvez, the documentation has been accomplished, and all that was needed was for an indemnification agreement to be signed with the pharmaceutical companies.
He also assured that minor snags in the storage and rollout of the vaccines had been addressed, like having additional third-party storage facilities provided by local pharmaceutical companies, which can address the low-temperature requirement of the vaccines.
The expenses for the third-party storage facilities would also be included in the loans that the government would acquire for the COVID-19 vaccine procurement.

Galvez did not make mention of a specific vaccine that the country will receive from the COVAX facility, a platform that aims to ensure rapid, fair, and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines for people in all countries.
But earlier, he said the Philippines might be able to get the Covid-vaccine developed by American drugmaker Pfizer-BioNTech as early as February via COVAX facility.
Asked which vaccines the Philippines could receive from the COVAX facility, Galvez said it may be Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, COVAVAX developed by the Serum Institute of India, and Johnson & Johnsons.
“Talagang ito po ay global interest na we can contain yung virus through the WHO [World Health Organization] concept of equitable access to poor countries like us,” Galvez said.

MANILA, Philippines — Despite the delivery on Sunday of donated COVID-19 vaccines in the country, President Rodrigo Duterte still rejected the resumption of face-to-face classes in the country.
“Not now. I cannot make that decision. It will place the children in jeopardy,” he said in a press conference after the turnover ceremony of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.“I am not ready to lose the lives of our young people, our children. No,” he said when asked the issue.
Duterte had earlier thumbed down a new proposal to resume in-person classes while the government’s mass immunization program against Covid-19 remained pending.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III earlier pushed for the resumption of face-to-face classes in areas with few or no COVID-19 cases.
He said he would propose on Monday a resolution that would urge the executive department to resume face-to-face classes to allow the country’s educational system to catch up with its Southeast Asian neighbors.

MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte was not asking for free vaccines, but only wanted the Philippines to have a guaranteed share when he threatened to continue with the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) if the US could not provide its COVID-19 vaccines to the country, Malacañang clarified on Sunday.
Duterte, in a speech on Saturday night, demanded at least 20 million doses of coronavirus vaccines from the U.S. to lift the termination of the VFA. 
“Hindi po, babayaran po natin. Ang problema lang po, yung supply. Ang sinasabi ng Presidente, at least bigyan niyo kami ng supply. Hindi naman tayo nanlilimos, meron naman tayong perang pambayad dyan at babayaran natin,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in an interview over Teleradyo.
(No, we will pay. The problem is the supply. The President is saying that they should at least give us a supply. We’re not begging, we have money to pay for that and we will pay.)

“Sa katunayan, mga pribadong sektor, mga lokal na pamahalaan, sila mismo ay nagbubudget para bumili. Kaya lang, yung supply ang pinaguusapan. So yun po yun. Hindi tayo humihingi ng libre, magbabayad tayo. Kailangan bigyan tayo ng supply gaya naman nung napagkasunduan ng ibang nauna,” he added.
(In fact, the private sectors and local government units are setting aside a budget to procure the vaccines. But the supply is what we’re talking about. That’s it. We’re not asking for free vaccines, we will pay. They should give us a supply just like their agreements with those who secured them first.)
It was in February when the Philippine government, upon instruction of Duterte, sent a notice to the U.S. embassy to terminate the VFA. It was supposed to take effect in August.

However, the scrapping of VFA was shelved for six months in June. The six-month suspension ends this December.
“Kung kinakailangan nilang ma-renew yung kanilang VFA para sa kanilang pangnasyonal na interes, importante sa Pilipinas na mabigay naman sila ng vaccine dahil yan ang kinakailangan natin para sa nasyonal na interes,” Roque said.
(If they want to renew their VFA for their national interest, it is important for the Philippines to secure their vaccines because that’s our national interest.)
“Yan po yung ibig sabihin ng Presidente, na hindi na po siya papayag na para bang tayo’y ina-under lang ng isang dating colonial nating master. So kailangan patas ang relasyon natin at kung hindi mabibigay ang vaccine sa atin, goodbye VFA ang sabi po ni Presidente,” he added.
(That’s what the President meant. He won’t allow for us to be under our former colonial masters. Our relationship should be fair and if the vaccine supply is not given to us, the President says we bid goodbye to the VFA.)

Galvez said the Philippines stands to get a total of 9,407,400 doses from the two pharmaceutical firms within the first and second quarters of this year through the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility.The country will receive 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which will be delivered in mid-February, while 5,500,800 to 9,290,400 doses are expected from AstraZeneca, whose initial delivery is scheduled by mid to late February, according to the letter of COVAX facility to the Philippine government.
“I would like to emphasize that according to COVAX the number of doses and the projected arrival of the vaccines are all indicative since it all depends on the global supply,” Galvez said in a statement.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the Covid-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca emergency use authorization.
Galvez said many local government units (LGUs) and the private sector are ready for the vaccine roll-out: from their vaccination sites, to their cold storage equipment and facilities, to their personnel.
“We were all clueless then on how to effectively manage and mitigate the impact of this infectious disease. But with the arrival of vaccines and the implementation of the National Action Plan Against COVID-19, we are now in a better position to put an end to the epidemic,” he said.
Galvez earlier said the government aims to inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos using the 148 million doses of vaccines it expects to obtain from seven pharmaceutical firms.
He urged Filipinos to “set their fears aside” and get vaccinated against Covid-19, assuring that the vaccines the government will administer passed the stringent selection and evaluation process of the vaccine experts panel, FDA, and the Department of Health.
“We are confident that with the whole nation working together, we will be able to recover our economy and bring back a greater sense of normalcy among our people,” he said.

MANILA, Philippines — Although negotiations are still ongoing, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Philippines is already looking at sourcing up to 50 million dosages of COVID-19 vaccines being developed by Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac Biotech.
“Tinitignan po natin unang una doon sa China, Sinovac, isa po ito sa mga sources natin na more or less 20 to 50 million doses ang kukunin natin doon,” said Galvez, who is also the country’s pandemic response chief implementer, in a televised briefing.(We are looking at China’s Sinovac as one of the sources, securing more or less 20 to 50 million doses.)

(We are getting a portfolio of access from different vaccine producers and countries so that we could have at least five to six countries to source the vaccines.)
China’s Sinovac has already submitted to the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration its application to conduct Phase 3 of clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
The Philippines is targeting to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos against the new coronavirus to achieve herd immunity wherein enough people in a specific area are protected against infectious disease.

REYES
The Philippines begins its COVID-19 vaccination drive on Monday with the first 600,000 doses of the donated Chinese vaccine CoronaVac in major government hospitals in Metro Manila.
The country has been expecting a bigger launch, but the delivery of 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the global vaccine supply pool COVAX on Monday will be delayed by a week due to a supply problem, according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.President Duterte attended a ceremony to mark the arrival of the initial 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on Sunday afternoon. A Chinese military aircraft delivered the vaccines.
“With this very important shipment, I am confident that more batches of vaccines will be available with great dispatch until every Filipino will be given the chance to be vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity,” Mr. Duterte said.
The President said the Chinese donation underscored the friendly relations between Manila and Beijing.
“I convey my sincere gratitude to the Chinese people and the government of China for this gesture of friendship and solidarity—the hallmark of Philippines-China partnership,” Mr. Duterte said.
Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said “more Chinese vaccines procured by the Philippine government will surely come soon as expected.”
He was referring to 25 million doses of CoronaVac due to be delivered to the Philippines in batches this year.
“It is a fine tradition between China and the Philippines to help each other in trying times. Our two governments and peoples have helped each other and joined hands to fight the pandemic since the outbreak of the virus, forging a closer China-Philippines partnership,” Huang said.
With the arrival of the Sinovac vaccine, the Philippines’ vaccine rollout formally starts, said Carlito Galvez Jr., head of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and chief implementer of the vaccination program.
President Duterte ordered the first round of vaccinations to begin in the first week of March, after the delivery in February of the 117,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine from COVAX was delayed.Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, the Senate health committee chair who is a former aide to the President, said vaccines for the Visayas and Mindanao would also arrive this month.
Duque announced the delay in the delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccines in a television interview later Sunday.
“We received communication earlier today that the delivery would be delayed by about a week,” Duque said. He quoted the World Health Organization (WHO) as saying the delay was due to a supply problem.
Waiting for AstraZeneca
Galvez said the AstraZeneca vaccines were part of the 5.5 million to 9 million doses the Philippines had requested from COVAX, a vaccine sharing scheme led by the WHO and the vaccine alliance GAVI to ensure an equitable vaccine supply to poor countries.
The AstraZeneca vaccine offers front-line health workers an option as they decide whether to get inoculated.
Many of them said they were willing to wait for the British-Swedish drug and step aside from the queue for CoronaVac, which had been found only 50.4 percent effective in protecting health workers in the COVID-19 wards.
Dr. Tony Leachon, a health advocate and former consultant to the government’s pandemic managers, lauded the government effort, but said “I’d like to wait for AstraZeneca for the following reasons: higher efficacy rate, track record of the company, clinical study published in peer reviewed journal, [and] clinical studies reviewed and endorsed by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC).”
“The fact that [health-care workers] now have a choice is better because the overarching consideration is to have them protected in the soonest possible time. They won’t feel forced if they didn’t like the other [brand],” Dr. Gene Nisperos of the Community Medicine Development Foundation said.
SOLIDARITY President Duterte (fourth from right), here speaking with Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian on Sunday afternoon, hails China’s delivery of an initial 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac as a “gesture of friendship and solidarity.” —RICHARD A. REYES
Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 said its members would also await the HTAC recommendation. It “will help us decide if we will accept [CoronaVac],” said Dr. Antonio Dans, spokesperson for the group.
Dans said HTAC, an independent council of medical experts that advises the Department of Health (DOH), is set to review Sinovac’s trial data this week.
Regardless of the brand, Dans said, “as long as it is [approved by] the Food and Drug Administration and HTAC, we believe the best vaccine is the one in your arm.”
Dr. Jonas del Rosario, spokesperson for Philippine General Hospital (PGH), said the latest survey of the hospital’s personnel showed 12 percent of the staff were willing to be inoculated with CoronaVac.
“This is only voluntary. We won’t force it on anyone. The doctors, nurses and other PGH employees have the right of refusal,” said Del Rosario, a COVID-19 survivor who lost both parents to the disease. It was announced earlier that he would be the first to get inoculated at the hospital.
100K shots for military
Of the 600,000 doses of CoronaVac that arrived on Sunday, 100,000 doses will go to the military. The rest will be given to health workers.
Five to six police-escorted refrigerated vans transported the CoronaVac shots delivered on Sunday through C5 Road to the MetroPac Movers Inc. (MMI), a third-party logistics and storage provider of the DOH at Barangay Concepcion I in Marikina City.
From MMI, a few hundred doses were transported late in the evening to PGH, Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center.
Simultaneous “symbolic” vaccinations in the six hospitals are scheduled at 9 a.m. on Monday, with Duque and Galvez standing first in line at the Lung Center and at the PGH, respectively, Go said in a radio interview on Sunday.
But President Duterte told reporters later that he and his top officials would be inoculated later with another China-made vaccine that he did not name.
The President said his doctor thought he should get another brand.
“It’s a Chinese brand, but not [CoronaVac], he said.
Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro said he also offered MMI for the storage of AstraZeneca vaccines, because of its proximity to hospitals in Metro Manila.
A DOH source said the Sinovac vaccines did not come with syringes, but the DOH was providing auto-disable 0.5 ml syringes for the first round of vaccinations.
Dr. Rommel Lobo of the National Adverse Effect Following Immunization Committee said hospitals’ supply of epinephrine, a common drug for treatment in case of anaphylaxis or severe allergic reaction, was enough.

“Meron na po tayo from 11 hospitals, meron na po tayong 2,793 na na-inoculate as of 19:33 (7:33 p.m.) kagabi,” Galvez said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel when asked how many people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 so far.(From 11 hospitals, we have 2,793 inoculated as of 19:33 last night.)
Of the total vaccine recipients, Galvez said 12 people experienced “minor” adverse effects while 154 people deferred their scheduled vaccination.
“Meron po tayong 154 na deferred kasi during screening, nakita natin na may high blood (pressure), yung mga ninenerbyos at saka yung talagang di-nefer natin because of some medical conditions,” Galvez explained.
(We have 154 people who deferred because, during the screening, they either had high blood pressure, nervousness or had some medical conditions.)
The Philippines was able to launch its Covid-19 vaccination program after receiving 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by the Chinese government.
Cebu City and Davao City are expected to roll out the vaccines this week at the Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center and at the Southern Philippines Medical Center, respectively.
The government is eyeing to vaccinate all healthcare workers in March, Galvez has said.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson
MANILA, Philippines — The national government has announced that it is already prepared for the expected rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in the country this month.
The government has also recently approved and ratified its plan for mass immunization against Covid-19. The detailed list of the priority population for the scheduled inoculation has also been released last week.While it seems like everything is underway for the country’s vaccination program, several doctors and medical experts clarified that there is a certain group of individuals who are not advised to receive jabs of Covid-19 vaccines.
Who should not receive shots of the Covid-19 vaccine?
According to Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, a pediatric infectious disease expert and Department of Health (DOH) technical advisory group member, there is currently only one contraindication to Covid-19 vaccination.
“Currently yung nag-iisang contraindication is yung anaphylaxis or a severe allergy to a previous dose,” Lim said in an online briefing on Monday, explaining that those who will experience this contraindication will not be allowed to take further doses of Covid-19 vaccine.
(Currently, the only contraindication is anaphylaxis or a severe allergy to a previous dose of Covid-19 vaccine.)
The guidelines set by the Philippine Society of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (PSAAI) stated that: “Patients who have experienced an immediate allergic reaction, whether mild (e.g.rashes) or severe (e. g. anaphylaxis) to Covid-19 vaccine after the first dose should not receive the second dose.”
“Patients who have a history of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to certain vaccine excipients such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) (which can also be found in colonoscopy preparation, or laxatives) or to polysorbate (which can be found in vascular graft materials, surgical gels, PEGylated medications) should not receive the Covid-19 vaccines.”
The persons mentioned by PSAAI, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), should not receive vaccine shots either from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, since PEG is a component of the mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine.
The patients are also advised by PSAAI to be referred to an allergist for further evaluation.
“Patients who have experienced an immediate allergic reaction, such as urticaria, angioedema, difficulty of breathing, regardless of severity, to any OTHER vaccine or
injected therapy must be evaluated by an allergist to assess possible allergic reactions to PEG or polysorbate. All vaccinated patients should be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination,” PSAAI added.“Wala pa naman tayong nababakunahan so di natin masasabi,” said Dr. Carmela Kasala of the Philippine Pediatric Society, adding that it is crucial to monitor for any adverse effects following the first round of Covdi-19 vaccination in the country.
(We have yet to start vaccinating people so it is hard to say.)
“Yung mga on the second round natin kung nag react siya sa unang vaccine na binigay sa kanya, ‘di na po pwede ibigay yung pangalawang shot kasi baka maging fatal pa yung mangyari but this is very rare,” Kasala added.
(During the second round of vaccination, if the person severely reacted to the first dose, he/she can not get the second dose or shot because it might become fatal — although that kind of situation is very rare.)
Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) enumerated the following conditions that may disqualify a person from getting the coronavirus vaccine, specifically the Pfizer-BioNTech product:
extreme allergic reactions
pregnant and breastfeeding women
children
Can immunocompromised persons get Covid-19 vaccines?
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Friday said that immunocompromised individuals cannot receive jabs of Covid-19 vaccine due to adverse effects.
“‘Yong mga immunocompromised, ‘yong kanilang immune system na mahina o may tama, ay hindi natin pwedeng bigyan ng bakuna,” he told reporters in an ambush interview.
(Immunocompromised individuals, those whose immune systems are either weak or have taken a hit we cannot give them vaccines.)
Duque cited previous reports that some elderly people with underlying health conditions in Norway have died after getting inoculated with vaccine from the PfizerBioNTech.
However, according to the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), a committee which acts as a scientific and clinical advisory body to the WHO, there is no evidence yet linking the reported deaths of elderly people and PfizerBioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine.
“The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of BNT162b2,” GACVS said in a statement last month.
“Reports are in line with the expected, all-cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub-population of frail, elderly individuals, and the available information does not confirm a contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events,” the committee added.
Health reform advocate Dr. Tony Leachon and kidney specialist Dr. Carlo Trinidad also disputed what they described as an “irresponsible” and “misleading” statement by Duque.
“Sec. Duque should rectify and qualify this misleading information. We will deprive the people who will surely benefit from vaccination,” Leachon said in a Twitter post on Friday.
“I think [Duque is] confused or tired. Perhaps he must consult his vaccine expert panel.As long as these are not live attenuated vaccines, they hold no specific risk to an immunocompromised patient, other than any factors specific to the individual that could be a contraindication,” Leachon said in a separate Tweet.
Meanwhile, according to Trinidad, “Pfizer trials included patients with baseline comorbidities such as those with CANCER, AIDS, DIABETES, LEUKEMIA, LIVER DISEASE.”
Based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), Covid-19 vaccines that use mRNAs such as PfizerBioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are “unlikely to pose a safety risk” for transplant patients since it is not a live vaccine.
“[B]ecause immunocompromised people may be at risk for severe COVID-19, CDC recommends these groups may still receive the vaccine if there are no contraindications,” the US-based medical association explained on its website.
“Transplant recipients should be counseled that the effectiveness and safety profile of these vaccines for them are not currently known,” IDSA added.
On the other hand, oncology patients, which IDSA said “many of whom are immunocompromised either by virtue of their disease of cancer or their treatment, e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplant,” can also get Covid-19 vaccines if they have no contraindications to vaccination.
However, since there are still limited data on the vaccines’ safety profile and efficacy in immunocompromised populations, IDSA suggested counseling patients before taking vaccine shots for Covid-19.
IDSA likewise clarified that patients with autoimmune diseases can be inoculated against Covid-19.
“Autoimmune disease is not a contraindication for the mRNA vaccines. The study populations for both mRNA vaccine trials included participants with autoimmune disease.”
“No imbalances were observed in the occurrence of symptoms consistent with autoimmune conditions or inflammatory disorders in clinical trial participants who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine compared to placebo.”
What about other allergic reactions and conditions?
CDC said those who have a food allergy, pet allergy, environmental allergies, and allergies to oral medications (including the oral equivalents of injectable medications) can and should get Covid-19 vaccine shots.
The agency explained that allergic reactions “not related to vaccines, injectable therapies, components of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines (including PEG), or polysorbates” are not considered a contraindication or precaution to Covid-19 vaccination.
“Hindi po totoo na contraindication kung may mag allergies kayo o asthma o may food allergy or drug allergy, hindi po totoo na hindi niyo pwedeng ma-receive ang bakuna. Pwede po [kayo mabakunahan],” Kasala emphasized.
(It is not true that yous should not get Covid-19 vaccine if you have allergies, asthma, food allergy, or drug allergy. You can still get vaccinated.)
“‘Wag po matakot. Isipin natin mas maraming benepisyo sa paglagay sa bakuna kesa sa wala tayong bakuna,” she added.
(Do not be afraid. Just think about it, there are more benefits in receiving Covid-19 vaccines than having none.)
Also included in PSAAI’s “special group” who can receive Covid-19 vaccines are:
Patients with allergic reactions (of any severity) to food, inhalant/environmental allergens, insects, latex, oral medications, not related to vaccines and their components, can receive Covid-19 vaccines.
Patients with immunodeficiency and autoimmune disease (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Bell’s palsy) may also get vaccinated but they should be informed that there is still not enough data available to establish vaccine safety and efficacy in these conditions.
Patients with well-controlled asthma and on inhaled corticosteroids, and those with allergic rhinitis on intranasal corticosteroids can receive the Covid-19 vaccine.

MANILA, Philippines — American biotechnology company Moderna is accelerating a huge shipment of COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. said, citing information from Manila’s top diplomat in the United States.
Locsin made the announcement on Sunday, more than a week after Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose “Babe” Romualdez said Moderna and another company, Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc., are willing to supply up to 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines in the third quarter of 2021.“More good news from Babe: Moderna on board and accelerating huge shipment. Everything’s falling back into place,” Locsin tweeted.
“We will have complete range of vaccines from least effective to most available for everyone to choose from,” he added.
Locsin added that a COVID-19 vaccine will not be “mass deployed” unless the “official recommending it for mass deployment is seen taking it himself.”

“The only proof of the pudding is in the eating it oneself and no one else in his place until we see the side effects of the pudding if any,” Locsin said.
https://twitter.com/teddyboylocsin/status/1343005805587570688
Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine earlier received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the US Food and Drug Administration.This will enable the pharmaceutical firm to apply for an EUA in the Philippines.
The Philippine government and private companies signed a supply agreement with British drugmaker AstraZeneca involving at least two million doses.
Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also looking into the vaccines of China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and Pfizer from the US.
Earlier, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III received backlash after he allegedly “dropped the ball” in the Pfizer vaccine deal, which would have secured the delivery of 10 million doses of the company’s vaccine to the Philippines as early as January next year.

International Labor Affairs Bureau Director Alice Visperas said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III has spoken with the UK ambassador to the Philippines regarding the deal.Visperas said among the requests made by Bello to the UK government in exchange for the exemption on the deployment cap are the renewal of the 2002 and 2003 bilateral labor agreements between the UK and the Philippines, as well as the provision of vaccines.
READ: UK, Germany want exemption from deployment limit of Filipino healthcare workers
“Pangalawa, ‘yung hiling ni Secretary Bello na vaccine mula sa kanilang gobyerno ay mabigyan tayo dito sa Pilipinas lalong-lalo na para sa ating mga OFWs (overseas Filipino workers),” she said in an online media forum on Monday as she enumerated the requests made by the Labor Secretary.
(The second request of Secretary Bello is the provision of vaccines from the UK government to the Philippines, especially for OFWs.)
She added that the DOLE had requested the same from Germany.
According to Visperas, Bello is considering exempting the two countries from the deployment cap if they will agree to the conditions set by the Philippine government.
She said that if the UK and Germany would grant the request of DOLE, the vaccines would go to OFWs who were already repatriated and those who are departing for jobs abroad.
Visperas also said no specific number of doses for the vaccines was mentioned, but added that the jabs may benefit around 600,000 OFWs since this is the number of overseas workers who were already repatriated or are again planning to leave the country.

MANILA, Philippines — Apart from China’s Sinovac, the Philippines is also eyeing to roll out in February Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine via the COVAX facility, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Tuesday.
“Baka mauna ang Pfizer because the COVAX facility will be deploying the early rollout of Pfizer so iintayin din namin ‘yun sa February,” Galvez said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel.(Pfizer might be first because the COVAX facility will be deploying the early rollout of Pfizer so we’re waiting for that this February.)
Galvez said they are meeting with the COVAX facility this morning to apply for its scheduled early rollout next month.
The COVAX facility is a platform that aims to ensure rapid, fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for people in all countries.
The COVAX facility already guaranteed COVID-19 vaccines for 20 percent of the Philippines’ population, the Department of Health said.
Earlier, the country already secured 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac.
Some 50,000 doses of this vaccine will arrive in the country also by February.

“Nag-order ako, kung pwede, sa malalaking kumpanya. Katulad nitong AstraZeneca, 2 million. Moderna, 200,000,” PRC chairman Senator Richard Gordon said in an interview over Teleradyo.(I ordered from big companies. Like AstraZeneca, 2 million. Moderna, 200,000.)
“At may kakausapin pa kaming ibang tao,” he added.
(We will also be talking to other people.)
Earlier, the senator said that the PRC is also eyeing to secure vaccine doses from Pfizer.
In its vaccination drive, Gordon said the PRC would allow vaccinees to donate for the vaccination of those who cannot afford the anti-Covid shots.
“Yung can afford, magbabakuna siya. Yung mahirap bibigyan niya ng pambakuna,” he added.
(Those who can afford, if they will get vaccinated, they can donate for the poor.)
Only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have so far secured an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Three companies are still waiting for their EUA approval from the FDA namely Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, China’s Sinovac, and India’s Bharat Biotech.
The Philippine government has already secured 108 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines after it signed five term sheets with different vaccine manufacturers, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said.

The Philippines already submitted its own indemnity agreement with the COVAX facility, assuring vaccine manufacturers that the government will assume responsibility should vaccine recipients experience adverse effects.
The government, however, is still awaiting the vaccine manufacturer’s separate indemnity agreement to finalize the delivery of vaccines.
Meanwhile, the delivery of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine donated by China may also be delayed as it has yet to secure an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration.
So far, the local regulators have granted an EUA to vaccines developed by Pfizer and British drugmaker AstraZeneca.

MANILA, Philippines — The first shipment of COVID-19 vaccines developed by British-Swede drugmaker AstraZeneca has arrived in the Philippines on Thursday.The plane carrying 487,200 vaccine doses from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility landed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) past 7 p.m.
It will later be towed to Villamor Air Base where government officials, including President Rodrigo Duterte, will welcome its arrival.
“I am pleased to inform you that the shipment of 487,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccines arrived tonight. After the ceremony these will immediately be delivered to storage for repackaging to prepare for immediate distribution to our frontliners,” Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, chairman of the NTF Covid-19, which is the chief implementer of all IATF resolutions.After the ceremony, the vaccines will be transported to Metropac, Marikina City.
This is the second batch of vaccines to arrive in the Philippines, following the 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses donated by the Chinese government, which arrived last Sunday, February 28.
The vaccines were initially set to arrive on March 1 but were delayed due to global supply problems.
The number of doses set to arrive was also at 525,600 but was reduced due to cargo limitations as the vaccine will be delivered using a commercial flight, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. explained.
The Philippines is expected to receive about 5.5 million to 9.2 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses this year through the COVAX facility.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic
MANILA, Philippines — While other countries have begun inoculating their citizens against the coronavirus disease, the people of the Philippines are still waiting at the sidelines for the first doses of the vaccine from various drug manufacturers to arrive.
The government, through the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has so far given its emergency use authorization (EUA) to three COVID-19 vaccine developers — the United States’ Pfizer-BioNTech, United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca-Oxford University, and most recently China’s Sinovac.The EUAs were granted to speed up the process of receiving doses of vaccines even as these medicines have not been globally approved for commercial use. In the local setting, the EUAs will help push forward the country’s inoculation drive, which has been held back by a series of delays and the limited supply of vaccines.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., also the lead of the National Task Force against COVID-19, has been busy of late fending off brickbats for the delay in the arrival of the vaccines, on which hinged a number of things — jumpstarting the slumped economy, shift to the less restrictive modified general community quarantine,and the reopening of in-person school classes, to name a few.
Amid all these, the country has yet to receive a single dose of vaccine, that even President Rodrigo Duterte has been said to have expressed his impatience over the delays.
“More than 100,000 Pfizer/BioNTech doses have also been allotted to the Philippines through the COVAX initiative,” said Katharina Buchholz, a data journalist for Statista, analysis by market and data consumer company.
“But these can only be delivered after the Philippines have enacted a framework for compensating those who might potentially suffer from side effects of the vaccine. The mandatory condition that will absolve Pfizer of direct responsibility highlights the bureaucratic hurdles of receiving some coronavirus vaccines,” she added.
The Department of Health (DOH) Tuesday reported that the country has a total of 564,865 Covid-19 cases. Of the sum, 29,817 are active cases and 522,941 are recoveries. Around 12,107 individuals have succumbed to the disease.
In numbers: Vaccination drive in other Asian nations
Based on the Feb. 23 data compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, over 700 million vaccine doses have already been administered in Asia.
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations
Data showed that Israel has been vaccinating its population faster than any countries in Asia and globally. As of February 20, 82.8 doses ofA vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine while a fully vaccinated person has received the maximum required doses.
Vaccination progress in Asia
According to recent data by Statista, more than a dozen of countries in Asia had already started its vaccination drives during the past weeks.
However, the firm noted that some countries are seeing a slowdown in administering vaccines to portions of its population. This includes China, which developed its own vaccines. The consumer company saidChina’s vaccination is currently atat a rate of 2-3 doses administered per 100 people.
“[T]he campaigns are also still in the early stages,” Buchholz said.
Covid-19 have been administered in the country for every 100 people.
India, which started inoculating its people last month, also seemed to be at a slow pace when it comes to its vaccine rollout.
“[I]ndia’s rollout has been somewhat slower at currently 0.8 doses administered per 100 people despite the fact that the country has also developed its own shot and is currently producing the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine under the name Covishield. Some Indians have shunned the locally developed variety Covaxin since third stage trial results are still outstanding,” Buchholz added.
Meanwhile, the firm observed in its report that vaccine diplomacy, donation, and gifts from countries where the vaccines are developed helped several countries to to kickstart their inoculation drive.
“The Seychelles have used China’s Sinopharm vaccine since January 11 and have now already given out 66 doses per 100 people, also using Covishield from India. The Maldives, which like the Seychelles received the Covishield vaccine as a gift, counted almost 14 doses per 100 people since starting the campaign on Feb 1, according to Our World in Data.”
The donation effort of the locally produced University of Oxford vaccine is also benefiting Mauritius, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, among others. China has also donated its vaccines to Cambodia, Laos and Pakistan, while Indonesia is a paying customer to the Chinese.”
Acquired vaccines per country
Our World in Data showed that the countries in Asia have acquired and/or administered Covid-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik V, and Covaxin.
Vaccines from US-based multinational pharmaceutical corporation Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech has reached the following Asian countries:
Bahrain
Cyprus
Israel
Kuwait
Lebanon
Oman
Qatar
Saudi Arabia
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Japan
Singapore
Pfizer-BioNTech uses mRNA (messenger RNA) in its vaccines. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mRNAis a genetic molecule that carries the instructions for making proteins in our body.
This vaccine requires two shots that will be given 21 days apart. It should be kept in a storge with a temperature of -70 degrees Celsius. Pfizer’s vaccine showed a 95 percent efficacy rate during its study.

Explainer: Facts about 7 COVID-19 vaccines Philippines may get
Similar to Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna’s “mRNA-1273” uses mRNA in its vaccine. Moderna’s vaccine needs to be stored at -20C. Twodoses should be administered with 28 days apart.
Israel received Moderna’s vaccines which has a 94.5% efficacy rate.
China’s Sinopharm vaccine, which reportedly has a 79% efficacy rate, is used in the following Asian countries:
Bahrain
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
China
Macao
Pakistan
Cambodia
Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, developed the CoronaVac which likewise uses RNA and relies on inactivated pathogens that are grown and killed in laboratories.
This is being used in:
Turkey
China
Indonesia
CoronaVac can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius.
China’s Sinovac Biotech previously received backlash for reportedly having only a 50.4 percent efficacy rate at preventing symptomatic infections in its late-stage trial in Brazil.
Meanwhile, British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca uses a genetically altered virus called adenovirus.
This virus, which is not harmful to recipients, will carry spike protein (like the “crowns” in coronavirus). Injecting this, in theory, will help the immune system to recognize and attack coronavirus.
Among the Asian countries that are using this vaccine are:
Azerbaijan
Oman
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Bangladesh
India
Maldives
Nepal
Pakistan
Sri Lanka
Myanmar
AstraZeneca’s vaccine requires a regular fridge temperature for storage.
The researchers noted that the efficacy rate for two doses – with the first dose at half strength – reached 90 percent. While a combination of two full-strength doses only resulted in 62 percent efficacy.
Gamaleya Research Institutes’s Sputnik V vaccine, a two-part adenovirus-based vector vaccine, uses a vector (an engineered virus that lacks the gene to reproduce) to send a message in cells to produce spike proteins.
“The gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed while a gene with the code of a protein from another virus spike is inserted,” the institute explained.
“This inserted element is safe for the body but still helps the immune system to react and produce antibodies, which protect us from the infection,” it added.
Sputnik V, which was found to have a 91.4% efficacy rate, is administered in:
Azerbaijan
Iran
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
Pakistan
Aside from AstraZeneca, India also uses India-based firm Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin in the country’s inoculation drive.

Manila City health officer Dr. Arnold Pangan said Thursday that the local measles vaccination drive should be completed before the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines, so that health personnel of the local government unit can fully focus on vaccination activities against the new coronavirus.So far, 38,603 children aged nine to 59 months (four years and nine months) in the city have already been vaccinated against measles and rubella since the inoculation program started last Monday.
The figure represents 27.10 percent of the MHD’s target, according to Pangan.
He said the city government aims to vaccinate about 146,000 children by mid-February.
“If we can do it in two weeks time, mas maganda po kasi baka dumating na ’yung COVID-19 vaccine. Baka magdodoble-doble pa po ‘yung trabaho nila (health workers), so pinipilit natin na bilisan pa para po mas ma-achive natin ‘yung goal natin the soonest possible time,” Dr. Pangan said in a statement.
(If we can do it in two weeks time, that would be better because Covid-19 vaccines may already arrive, and then the work of our health workers may become doubly hard. That’s why we want to expedite the vaccination so that we can achieve our goal at the soonest possible time.)
The vaccination program against measles is being implemented nationwide through coordination between the Department of Health, World Health Organization, United Nations Children’s Fund, RELIEF International, Healthy Philippines, and local government units across the country.

The Philippines is currently in final talks with Moderna for the procurement of up to 20 million doses of its vaccine.
“The creation and deployment of safe and effective vaccines take us a step closer to defeating this pandemic and restoring our economies,” Romualdez also said.
He then underscored the importance of close collaboration within the international community and between governments and private entities in ensuring the procurement of vaccines.
In the Philippines, the government is eyeing the rollout of the national inoculation program by February.

Jonvic Remulla said in a Facebook post on Monday.
Remulla said provincial officials had started talks with British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca over its COVID-19 vaccine, which would be for those aged 18 to 59 years old.“Astra Zeneca is proven 60-91% effective in preventing COVID-19,” Remulla said in his post.
According to him, they are waiting for a response from American pharmaceutical firms Moderna and Pfizer about buying vaccines suitable for senior citizens — that is, those aged 60 and above.
Previously, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines might be delayed for about a week due to supply problems.
However, the initial batch of AstraZeneca vaccines came from the first round of allocated doses from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility. This would include 525,600 doses of COVID-19 vaccines.
Other vaccines that local government units procured separately from the national government will come later.
The Philippines started vaccinating government health workers and other frontliners on Monday, a day after the arrival of the Chinese government-donated COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac Biotech.Among the first to get inoculated were Philippine General Hospital Director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director-General Eric Domingo, and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos.
The government aims to vaccinate 70 million Filipinos in a bid to achieve herd immunity — that is, when a big enough percentage of the population becomes immune from the virus, either through vaccination or prior infection.

MANILA, Philippines — British drug maker AstraZeneca has already submitted the necessary documents to Philippine health authorities to secure approval in conducting clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said this Wednesday, just days after AstraZeneca announced that its COVID-19 vaccine can be 90% effective.“They already submitted their documents to our Vaccine Experts Panel last November 16, during that time may kulang pa [they still have deficiencies],” Vergeire told reporters in an online media briefing.
“Immediately, last November 18, they were able to complete all the documentary requirements. So the evaluation of our vaccine experts panel and Ethics Review Board can now start,” she added.
Should AstraZeneca passed the panel’s initial evaluation, it will then secure the approval of the Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines before it can proceed with its clinical trials here.
Philippine vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier bared that the country is in advance talks with the British firm to supply at least 20 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine.
Galvez said the Philippine government could enter into an advance market agreement with AstraZeneca before the end of November.
China’s Sinovac Biotech is the first drug maker to get the Philippine panel’s green light. The panel is also evaluating the COVID-19 vaccines of Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen subsidiary for late-stage trials.

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine government is now in the final stages of negotiation with American biotechnology company Moderna for the procurement of up to 20 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccines.
Moderna’s vaccines may be expected for delivery to the Philippines in mid-2021, according to Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Romualdez.“I am please to share that, following months of discussions with Moderna, the Philippines is in the final stages of negotiating for the supply of a minimum of 10 million doses of mRNA-1273, the company’s vaccines, with the option to purchase an additional 10 million doses, for delivery beginning in mid-2021,” Romualdez said in a statement posted by the embassy over Twitter on Wednesday.
Last December, Romualdez said Moderna and another company, Arcturus Therapeutics Holdings Inc., are willing to supply up to 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines in the third quarter of 2021.
“I welcome the pledge of support of the private sector led by ICTSI’s Enrique Razon in shipping and distributing the vaccines from the manufacturing facility in Spain to the Philippines at no cost to the Philippine government,” Romualdez went on.
National Task Force (NTF) Against COVID-19 chief and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said the government is eyeing to secure a total of 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within the week.
Galvez said the Philippines has so far secured 30 million doses of the Covovax coronavirus vaccine, which he said is extendible to 40 million doses.
The government has also secured 25 million vaccine doses from China’s Sinovac, 30 million doses of vaccine from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, and 25 million doses of Russia’s Gamaleya or Sputnik V vaccine.

MANILA, Philippines — Moderna, Inc. has agreed to supply the Philippines with 13 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine, with the deliveries coming in mid-2021.The biotechnology company said it will work with regulators in the Philippines for necessary approvals prior to the distribution, as its vaccine is currently not yet approved for use in the country.
Moderna said a separate agreement with the Philippine government and the private sector for the supply of an additional seven million doses of the vaccine is also anticipated.“We thank the Government and the private sector for their collaboration to bring the COVID-19 Vaccine Moderna to the Philippines,” Stéphane Bancel, Chief Executive Officer of Moderna, said in a statement Saturday.
“We appreciate the confidence in Moderna, and our mRNA platform demonstrated by the Government of the Philippines. We remain committed to making our vaccine available on every continent to help end this global pandemic,” he added.Philippine ambassador to the US Jose Romualdez earlier said the Philippine government, along with the private sector, has secured up to 20 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine.
According to the World Health Organization, the COVID-19 vaccine from Moderna has been shown to have an efficacy rate of approximately 92 percent against the disease, starting 14 days after the first dose.

MANILA, Philippines — Two types of COVID-19 vaccines may arrive in the country as early as February, the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.
“May portfolio po tayo na iba’t ibang mga bakuna (We have a portfolio of different vaccines) and as early as February we might be receiving the deliveries of these vaccines,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in an interview on ABS-CBN’s Teleradyo.
“Mayroon pong dalawang klase ng bakuna (There are two types of vaccines) that can be available by February already,” she added.

Vergeire, however, refused to divulge more information on the vaccines.
“Antayin po natin si (Let us wait for information from our) vaccine czar. I hope you understand he is the one authorized to provide this kind of information,” she said, referring to Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., who is also the chief implementer of the government’s national action plan on the pandemic.The Philippines earlier signed a deal with the Serum Institute of India for 30 million doses of the Covovax COVID-19 vaccine.
The vaccines will be available by the third quarter of 2021.
The country has also secured 2.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca through a tripartite agreement with local private firms.
The vaccines are expected to arrive by the second quarter of the year.
Some local government units have also signed agreements with the national government and AstraZeneca for the supply of the inoculation shots.
The government is likewise in talks with other vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer and Moderna of the United States, Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm of China, and the Gamaleya Institute of Russia for the vaccination program.RELATED STORY:

MANILA, Philippines — Wealthy nations have already bought up at least 80% of the future COVID-19 vaccines supply, the Philippines’ vaccine czar said Wednesday.
COVID-19 policy chief implementer Carlito Galvez, Jr., who is also the designated vaccine czar, said developing countries like the Philippines are now scrambling for the remaining supply of the vaccines.“80% of the global market has been taken by the rich countries. Now we are fighting for the 18% because COVAX has gotten the other (2) percent,” Galvez said during the online Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum.
He was referring to the COVAX Facility, a global mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide which the Philippines joined in July.
The former military general explained that the deals were made possible by advance market commitments with pharmaceutical companies.
“If we will not do the advance market commitment, we will be at the tail end of the supply chain,” he said.
The Philippine government and private companies signed a supply agreement with British drugmaker AstraZeneca involving at least two million doses of its vaccine last week.
This is after President Rodrigo Duterte finally agreed to make advance commitments and advance payments to private vaccine developers to ensure supply for the Philippines despite expressing reservations in September due to the country’s procurement laws.
Galvez said the government is currently in negotiations with other big pharmaceutical companies for potential vaccine deals.
Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also looking into the vaccines of China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and Pfizer of the United States.

https://business.inquirer.net/304688/covid-19-vaccine-uncertainty-tempers-ph-growth-goal-for-2021,COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty tempers PH growth goal for 2021,Ben O. de Vera,"10:38 AM August 07, 2020","MANILA, Philippines — Without a vaccine yet to prevent COVID-19’s spread, President Duterte’s economic managers have tempered growth expectations for next year despite recovery from this year’s recession.
The Cabinet-level Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) last July 28 approved via ad referendum their projection that real gross domestic product (GDP) will contract between 4.4 percent and 6.6 percent — or an average of 5.5 percent — this year.In the first half, the economy shrank by an average of 9 percent as second-quarter GDP fell by a record 16.5 percent year-on-year and brought about a technical recession.
For 2021, GDP was projected to rebound by growing 6.5-7.5 percent, although slower than the DBCC’s estimate last May of a stronger 8-9 percent economic expansion.
Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua, the country’s chief economist, explained to the Inquirer that the slower growth range projection for next year was approved “to adjust to the emerging consensus that the virus will stay longer and the vaccine longer to develop.”
“The pandemic is assumed to last longer than we earlier thought — not until September only; could extend to the end of 2020 when vaccines are thought to become available,” Department of Finance (DOF) Undersecretary and chief economist Gil S. Beltran told the Inquirer separately.
“Recession in 2020 is deeper so that recovery would take longer,” Beltran added.
Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III during Security Bank’s online economic forum last Thursday expressed optimism that a vaccine “can bring a definitive end to this crisis.”
“Countries that are leading in the funding and development of these potential vaccines have committed to give the Philippines priority in purchasing doses once these are approved,” Dominguez said.
“The government, for its part, has adequate funds to purchase the vaccines. But for now, since we don’t have the vaccine yet, we treat infections and find ways to co-exist with the virus,” Dominguez added.
Last week, Dominguez said the government can afford to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and provide them for free to the poor through loans to be extended by two well-capitalized state-run banks.Dominguez had explained that their plan was for state-run Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC) to purchase the COVID-19 vaccines to be approved by the DOH’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), through a term loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines (Landbank) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).
“PITC will sell the vaccines to the DOH. The DOH will pay PITC over time from their future allocations from the national budget,” Dominguez had said.
Referring to Landbank and DBP, Dominguez had said that “the current balance sheets of both GFIs [government financial institutions] can support the estimated loan requirement of P20 billion.”
“Please recall that since 2016, by hardly collecting any dividends from Landbank and DBP, the national government, in effect, strengthened their capital bases. This, in turn, was made possible by the tax and administrative reforms that increased government revenues,” Dominguez had noted.
The two lenders’ cash dividends—mandated among government-owned and/or -controlled corporations (GOCCs) to be remitted to the national treasury—were being waived in recent years and instead used to recapitalize themselves.
As for those who could afford themselves a vaccine, Dominguez had said Landbank and DBP can also “fund loans to qualified borrowers who wish to supply FDA-approved vaccines on a commercial basis.”
Separately, Landbank president and chief executive Cecilia C. Borromeo told the Inquirer last week that the lender “may extend a credit facility for PITC for the purchase of necessary vaccines on behalf of the DOH, similar to what Landbank did when the national government launched the generic medicine program years ago.”
“The amount for the trade transaction credit facility will be based on the requirement of PITC, and the sharing between Landbank and DBP will logically be based on the size of the balance sheets of the GFIs and the preference of the DOF,” according to Borromeo, whose Landbank is bigger than DBP.

For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.",Inquirer,2020-08-07 10:38:00,"MANILA, Philippines — Without a vaccine yet to prevent COVID-19’s spread, President Duterte’s economic managers have tempered growth expectations for next year despite recovery from this year’s recession.For 2021, GDP was projected to rebound by growing 6.5-7.5 percent, although slower than the DBCC’s estimate last May of a stronger 8-9 percent economic expansion.Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua, the country’s chief economist, explained to the Inquirer that the slower growth range projection for next year was approved “to adjust to the emerging consensus that the virus will stay longer and the vaccine longer to develop.” “The pandemic is assumed to last longer than we earlier thought — not until September only; could extend to the end of 2020 when vaccines are thought to become available,” Department of Finance (DOF) Undersecretary and chief economist Gil S. Beltran told the Inquirer separately.Last week, Dominguez said the government can afford to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and provide them for free to the poor through loans to be extended by two well-capitalized state-run banks.Dominguez had explained that their plan was for state-run Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC) to purchase the COVID-19 vaccines to be approved by the DOH’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), through a term loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines (Landbank) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).As for those who could afford themselves a vaccine, Dominguez had said Landbank and DBP can also “fund loans to qualified borrowers who wish to supply FDA-approved vaccines on a commercial basis.” Separately, Landbank president and chief executive Cecilia C. Borromeo told the Inquirer last week that the lender “may extend a credit facility for PITC for the purchase of necessary vaccines on behalf of the DOH, similar to what Landbank did when the national government launched the generic medicine program years ago.” “The amount for the trade transaction credit facility will be based on the requirement of PITC, and the sharing between Landbank and DBP will logically be based on the size of the balance sheets of the GFIs and the preference of the DOF,” according to Borromeo, whose Landbank is bigger than DBP.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.Hero Wars | Sponsored There are thousands of Canadian jobs available!",4.0,0.8331000208854675,"vaccination, ph, get, galvez, duterte, first, dose, sinovac, health, supply","['uncertainty', 'temper', 'growth', 'goal']",-0.3818,0.591,0.114,0.295,0.0,Negative

Across the region, “this Goldilocks phase should see accelerating and above-trend year-on-year growth, rising but still benign inflation, and ‘big easy’ policies,” Morgan Stanley Research said in a Nov. 3 report titled “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.”“In particular, we believe that India, Indonesia and the Philippines look better placed in this Goldilocks environment, as they stand to benefit more from early vaccine availability and the Fed’s AIT framework,” Morgan Stanley added, referring to the US Federal Reserve’s new average inflation targeting which started this year.
“Even though daily COVID-19 cases have also come off earlier highs in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, these economies are likely trailing their Asian counterparts when it comes to COVID-19 containment. We think they could benefit disproportionately from vaccine availability, which could come as soon as later this year and/or early next year,” Morgan Stanley said.
In the case of the Philippines, Morgan Stanley noted that the government had already been in discussions with a number of possible vaccine sources such as China, Russia and the World Health Organization, as well as giant US drug firms like Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc.
“The government is also planning to hold talks with Australian biotech firm CSL Ltd. and partner University of Queensland, as it looks to diversify possible vaccine sources. While policymakers acknowledged that the Philippines does not have its own vaccine manufacturing capacity, it has sought to join clinical trials for vaccines,” Morgan Stanley said.
Also, the Philippines, India and Indonesia enjoy relatively lower debt-to-gross domestic product ratios compared to their neighbors, making them better positioned for an economic rebound in the medium term.
“We still believe that those with better balance sheets, better demographic trends and institutional ability to push through structural reforms to offset headwinds from deglobalization are likely to fare better. All things considered, we think India, Indonesia and the Philippines look better placed,” Morgan Stanley said.

ROBINSON NIÑAL JR./PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO
MANILA, Philippines — The national government has approved and ratified its plan for mass immunization against Covid-19 a year since the pandemic began in the country.
In a memorandum dated Jan. 26 but was released to the media this Saturday, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious DiseasesResolution No. 95 or the “Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for Covid-19 Vaccines” was approved.The memorandum was signed by National Task Force (NTF) against Covid-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr., as well as Defense Secretary and NTF chairperson Delfin Lorenzana, and Interior Secretary and NTF vice chairman Eduardo Año.
The memorandum ordered all agencies of NTF, its regional local Covid-19 task forces and all regional and local Covid-19 vaccination operations centers, local task forces and local Covid-19 vaccination operation centers to implement and adapt the vaccination plan.
The country’s vaccination plan, which was released by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), cited that P82.5 billion has been allocated for funding sources of the Covid-19 vaccine deployment program.
Under the 118-page vaccine plan, all regional offices and local government units are enjoined to put up vaccination operations centers (VOC) as soon as possible.
“The implementing units such as government hospitals (both private and public), private clinics, government agencies, rural health units) shall forward all concerns and reports to the City/Municipal Health Offices. The City/Municipal Health Offices, in turn, are required to report all concerns and updates to the VOC,” read the vaccine plan.
“All reports and unsettled issues of a VOC shall be raised to the overseeing VOC. The overseeing VOC, on the other hand, shall provide feedback and provide recommendation to the reporting VOC,” it added.
Masterlisting
The vaccine deployment plan also includes masterlisting or the linelisting and registration of the population before the vaccination process.
“This could be done through an online or offline platform developed by the DICT, and DOH’s KMITS and EB. From the masterlist, eligible populations for specific vaccines will be culled out and accessed by appropriate regions or LGU for registration, scheduling, mapping-out on appropriate vaccination sites and advisory,” read the Covid-19 vaccine plan.The LGUs are required to undergo profiling and screening of eligible target populations for the registration of mass immunization.
The masterlisting are as follows:
Group A includes frontline health workers, senior citizens, indigent population and uniformed personnel.
Group B includes other frontline workers and special populations.Group C, meanwhile, is the remaining population.
Consent for Covid-19 vaccine recipient
The country’s mass inoculation plan also underscored informed consent for citizens who will get vaccinated. It said informed consent is “ethical and legal requirement.”
Recipients must know the adverse effects as well as potential unknown risks of the Covid-19 vaccines.
“In the current situation, it will be important to make clear to potential recipients of a COVID-19 vaccine that the duration of immunity conferred is currently unknown and may not be equally effective across all age-groups. The benefits and risks that are disclosed will depend on what is known about them at the time consent is given,” read the vaccine deployment plan.
Post evaluation on vaccines
Also included in the vaccine plan are vaccine safety monitoring and management of adverse effects “after the first dose of vaccine was administered.”
“The role of vaccine safety monitoring during COVID-19 vaccine introduction is to facilitate the early detection, reporting, notification, investigation and analysis, and feedback of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), to ensure appropriate and timely case management and response,” read the vaccine plan.
“These activities shall assist vaccinees and ensure them of prompt and timely response should an AEFI occur,” it added.

MANILA, Philippines — China’s Sinovac has applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines for its COVID-19 vaccine.
“Yesterday afternoon, nag submit ng application ang Sinovac. Ang EUA nito is from China and they are undergoing pre-assessment now,” FDA Director-General Eric Domingo said in an online press briefing on Thursday.(Sinovac submitted its application yesterday afternoon. The EUA it currently has is from China and its application for a EUA in the Philippines is undergoing pre-assessment.)
However, he said the pharmaceutical firm still has to submit more data on its clinical trials.
“Medyo kulang pa ‘yung clinical trial data na pinadala nila. Nakita ko ang pinadala pa lang nila ‘yung clinical trial phase 1 and phase 2. We will have to ask them for the clinical trial phase 3 report,” said Domingo.
(The clinical trial data they have sent still lack some details. I saw that they only submitted data on their clinical trial phases 1 and 2. We will have to ask them for their report for clinical trial phase 3.)
Sinovac is the fourth vaccine manufacturer to submit its application for a EUA in the Philippines for COVID-19 vaccines.
American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer was the first to apply for a EUA on December 23 last year. The company acquired an emergency use authorization from the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday.
British-Swede pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca also applied for a EUA on January 6, and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute applied for the authorization for its Sputnik V vaccine on January 7.
The Philippines has already secured 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac, 50,000 of which will arrive in the country by February.
However, some critics have been questioning the government’s supposed preference for vaccines from Sinovac, considering its higher price and lesser reported efficacy rate as compared to other vaccines.
Reports state that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech showed a general efficacy of less than 60 percent in its late-stage trial in Brazil. The Department of Science and Technology maintains that the efficacy of the vaccines from the Chinese firm is acceptable as it is within the minimum requirement of the World Health Organization.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1384867/sinovac-jabs-varying-prices-raise-alarm,Varying prices of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine raise alarm,DJ Yap,"05:02 AM January 18, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — Sharp differences in the pri­ces of the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines and neighboring countries smack of corruption, Sen. Panfilo Lacson said on Sunday.
CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, costs as little as $5 per dose, or about P240, in other Southeast Asian countries, but may be priced at $38, or more than P1,800, in the Philippines, Lacson said.“The difference in prices of Sinovac vaccine at $5, $14 and $38 reminds me of an old story about how corruption is committed in three Southeast Asian countries—UNDER the table, ON the table, and INCLUDING the table,” he said in a post on Twitter.
“Here, it may cost $38.50 (P1,847.25) per dose but is co­vered by a confidentiality disclosure agreement,” he added.
Lacson cited a report in the Bangkok Post on Saturday saying the price of CoronaVac in Thailand was $5 per dose, based on figures from the World Health Organization and from the manufacturer. But a report in India Today on Tuesday said the price of CoronaVac in India was $14, or about P673, per dose.
Vice President Leni Robredo, speaking in her radio show on Sunday, also pointed out the varying prices of CoronaVac, citing a statement of Dr. Tony Leachon, a former adviser to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, that the price of the China-made vaccine, as reported by a Thai newspaper, was $5 in Thailand and $17 (P817) in Indonesia.
Robredo asked the Department of Health (DOH) for an explanation.
During budget deliberations in November, the DOH told the Senate committee on finance that the price of the Sinovac vaccine was P3,629.50 for the two-dose regimen.
The head of the government’s vaccine program, Carlito Galvez Jr., later disputed reports about CoronaVac’s pricing, claiming it was actually lower than the prices of other brands and was in the middle among seven drug manufacturers being eyed by the Philippine government as sources of COVID-19 vaccines.
Galvez, however, refused to disclose how much Sinovac had offered the government, citing confidentiality agreements.
‘Fake news’
In a radio interview on Sunday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that while officials were still not allowed to disclose how much the Sinovac vaccine would cost the government, he could say that it would be around P650—closer to the price in Indonesia.Roque called reports that the Sinovac shot cost over P3,600 “fake news.”
“China’s prices are not like capitalist companies that are market-dictated. They can adjust their prices accordingly, depending on who is buying,” he said. “That’s why Beijing doesn’t want to announce its prices, because other countries that are not as close to them would find out they might have bought at a more expensive price.”
In a subsequent tweet on Sunday afternoon, Lacson took note of the Malacañang statement, saying: “If it’s true that [the] government is now dropping the price of [the] Sinovac vaccine from P1,847.25 per dose to only P650, the Senate has probably done our share to save our people billions of pesos in the country’s vaccination program.”
Netizens, too, “can pat themselves on the back” for their outcry, he added.
A senior lawmaker, who asked not to be identified for lack of authority to discuss confidential negotiations, told the Inquirer that the cost of the vaccine could be lowered for governments on two conditions: if the country agrees to clinical trials, and if the country has the capacity to manufacture the vaccine locally.
Preference for Sinovac
During the Senate committee of the whole’s inquiry on the vaccination program last week, Lacson also noted that implementers of the vaccine program “apparently showed preference” for the CoronaVac maker, “which may fuel speculations that corruption is involved in the government’s dealings with Sinovac.”
“Sinovac has a track record of bribery, yet why insist on dealing with them?” he said in a radio interview on Saturday.
“Considering all these, can we blame the lawmakers and even our countrymen why they express suspicion in the government’s vaccination program?” he added.
Last week, Sinovac applied with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in the Philippines, but the regulator said the company submitted incomplete papers. Lacking were the results of Phase 3 clinical trials, the FDA said.
On Saturday, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced during a meeting with President Duterte in Malacañang that China would donate 500,000 doses of CoronaVac, but Sen. Francis Pangilinan said on Sunday that the donation should not influence the FDA into hastily approving the Sinovac vaccine.
“Science and the data and results of clinical trials should be the sole basis and not political goodwill,” Pangilinan said in a post on Twitter.
Critics have slammed the government’s plan to buy 25 million doses of CoronaVac, pointing out its steep price and poor showing in clinical trials.
The latest disappointing report about CoronaVac came from Brazil last week, with researchers returning a finding that the vaccine was only 50.4 percent effective, barely enough to gain regulatory approval.
Not done deal
At the close of the Senate inquiry on Friday, Galvez said the government had not yet paid for the 25 million doses and had only secured an advance market commitment from Sinovac to “lock in” a certain number of doses for the Philippines.
“So it’s not a done deal?” Sen. Nancy Binay asked.
“No,” Galvez replied. —WITH A REPORT FROM KRIXIA SUBINGSUBING INQ

For feedback, complaints, or inquiries, contact us.",Inquirer,2021-01-18 05:02:00,"CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, costs as little as $5 per dose, or about P240, in other Southeast Asian countries, but may be priced at $38, or more than P1,800, in the Philippines, Lacson said.“The difference in prices of Sinovac vaccine at $5, $14 and $38 reminds me of an old story about how corruption is committed in three Southeast Asian countries—UNDER the table, ON the table, and INCLUDING the table,” he said in a post on Twitter.“That’s why Beijing doesn’t want to announce its prices, because other countries that are not as close to them would find out they might have bought at a more expensive price.” In a subsequent tweet on Sunday afternoon, Lacson took note of the Malacañang statement, saying: “If it’s true that [the] government is now dropping the price of [the] Sinovac vaccine from P1,847.25 per dose to only P650, the Senate has probably done our share to save our people billions of pesos in the country’s vaccination program.” Netizens, too, “can pat themselves on the back” for their outcry, he added.A senior lawmaker, who asked not to be identified for lack of authority to discuss confidential negotiations, told the Inquirer that the cost of the vaccine could be lowered for governments on two conditions: if the country agrees to clinical trials, and if the country has the capacity to manufacture the vaccine locally.Preference for Sinovac During the Senate committee of the whole’s inquiry on the vaccination program last week, Lacson also noted that implementers of the vaccine program “apparently showed preference” for the CoronaVac maker, “which may fuel speculations that corruption is involved in the government’s dealings with Sinovac.” “Sinovac has a track record of bribery, yet why insist on dealing with them?” he said in a radio interview on Saturday.“Science and the data and results of clinical trials should be the sole basis and not political goodwill,” Pangilinan said in a post on Twitter.Not done deal At the close of the Senate inquiry on Friday, Galvez said the government had not yet paid for the 25 million doses and had only secured an advance market commitment from Sinovac to “lock in” a certain number of doses for the Philippines.For more information on COVID-19, call the DOH Hotline: (02) 86517800 local 1149/1150.",3.0,0.8604000210762024,"dose, duterte, get, arrive, coronavirus, astrazeneca, pfizer, first, country, palace","['vary', 'price', 'sinovac', 'raise', 'alarm']",-0.34,0.375,0.625,0.0,0.0,Negative
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1389022/covid-19-vaccines-dont-cause-infertility-say-yale-professor-student,"Covid-19 vaccines don’t cause infertility, say Yale professor, student",Cristina Eloisa Baclig,"07:23 PM January 27, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — As the country starts to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines, some myths and fears with the immunization shot still linger.
Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr., in a televised meeting on Tuesday, also cited the misinformation posted on social media by “anti-vaxxers” (people who disagree with the use of vaccines for a variety of reasons) as one of the causes of low confidence among Filipinos with receiving jabs of the incoming doses of vaccines.“This is a problem that needs to be addressed. We know that you will be of great help because the willingness of our countrymen to get vaccinated is decreasing due to the adverse effects of certain brands,” Galvez said, speaking in Filipino.
“At the same time, anti-vaxxers have a strong social media presence. This is a big challenge,” he added.
The Philippines is not the only country that is experiencing this. Anti-vaxxers are also a huge problem in the United States, especially now that they have started their inoculation campaign with batches of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccines.
In a New York Times article published on Tuesday, Akiko Iwasaki, Waldemar von Zedtwitz Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, and Yale M.D.-Ph.D student Alice Lu-Culligan debunked a specific rumor — which they believe discourages women to get vaccinated against Covid-19.
Myth: Covid-19 vaccines can make women infertile
According to Iwasaki and Culligan, the rumor claims that certain vaccines can cause infertility “by generating antibodies that not only target the coronavirus spike protein, as designed, but also inadvertently react with a protein in the placenta called syncytin-1.”
The vaccines’ antibodies, according to rumors, can attack the syncytin-1 and affect the development of the placenta because the coronavirus spike protein allegedly has a similar structure to the human protein.
Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna uses mRNA, a genetic molecule that carries the instructions for making proteins in our body, to instruct cells to make a harmless spike protein similar to those of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These spikes and spike fragments in the cells will be recognized by the immune system and cause an immune response that produces antibodies that hinders the virus from attacking other cells.
Explainer: Facts about 7 COVID-19 vaccines Philippines may getIwasaki and Culligan said that the “confusion is understandable,” since the US pharmaceutical companies Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna did not include research on pregnant and lactating women during their clinical trials.
“But the valid concerns about this information void have been eclipsed by targeted misinformation campaigns led by vaccine skeptics who are weaponizing women’s health issues to advance their agenda. These falsehoods are being spread to amplify our legitimate anxieties and undermine trust in vaccination,” they added.
Fact: Covid-19 vaccines are non-evasive to pregnant women
An analysis by the Yale professor and student found that there was no similarity between the viral spikes and the placental protein. They also noted that there have been no official and scientific reports yet citing Covid-19 vaccines as a cause for infertility.
In fact, they stated that some women were still able to get pregnant after receiving jabs of Covid-19 vaccines — either after contracting the disease or during the clinical trials of the vaccines.
Both Iwasaki and Culligan added that the vaccines might also benefit both the lactating mother and the infant. They also quashed the myth that pregnant women and their baby can get Covid-19 from the vaccines.
“[V]accines induce protective immune responses in the mother, creating antibodies that are passed to infants via breast milk and serve to protect them,” they said in the article.“[I]t is unlikely that the vaccine can cross into breast milk. Even if they did, they would not pose a threat to the health of a nursing baby; if ingested, these components would be digested and degraded in the gastrointestinal tract,” they added.
However, they emphasized that the Covid-19 can indeed make pregnant women more susceptible to severe illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the dreaded disease can increase the risk of preterm labor (which means that the baby might be delivered too early or before the 37 weeks of pregnancy is completed.)
“For any woman who is pregnant, nursing or trying to conceive, contracting Covid-19 is almost certainly more dangerous than getting immunized. And ultimately, mass vaccination, combined with physical distancing and wearing masks, provides the only way that we can end the pandemic and protect all women, men and children from the disease,” Iwasaki and Culligan said.
Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine in PH
The Philippines’ vaccine czar said the country might be able to acquire and rollout Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech by February via the COVAX Facility.
Last week, Galvez announced that there will be at least 40 million doses from the COVAX Facility. But, contrary to his earlier statement, he stated that the coming vaccines might be manufactured either by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, COVAVAX of the Serum Institute of India, or Johnson & Johnson.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1385899/ibp-says-there-is-legal-basis-in-public-outcry-for-covid-19-vaccine-prices,Public has legal basis to demand disclosure of COVID-19 vaccine prices,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,"03:35 AM January 20, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — There’s a “compelling legal basis” to grant the people’s request for the publication of COVID-19 vaccine prices even in the face of a pandemic, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) said in a statement issued on Monday.
“Transparency is helpful in establishing facts, dispelling doubts and suspicions, countering propaganda, minimizing political posturing, curbing corruption, promoting accountability, nurturing cooperation, and in enhancing trust in our country’s governance,” Domingo Cayosa, IBP national president, said.“It is good to let the people know more about the COVID 19 vaccines, the decisions to be made for them, and the public funds therefor.A well-informed citizenry will ‘heal as one,’ BETTER and FASTER,” he added.
According to Cayosa, Constitution has two provisions that mandate the government to make full public disclosure in transactions that involves the public interest — in this case, vaccines against a pandemic.
These provisions are Article II in Section 28 and Ariticle III in Section 7.
Cayosa cited a case between former Solicitor General Francisco Chavez and the National Housing Authority which the Supreme Court decided citing those provisions.
Quoting the decision, Cayosa said: ‘These provisions of the Constitution seek to promote transparency in policy-making and in the operations of the government, as well as provide the people sufficient information to exercise effectively other constitutional rights.”
But Cayosa also mentioned that Executive Order No, 2 — signed by President Rodrigo Duterte himself — which provides a legal presumption favoring access to information.
“Executive Order No. 2 which was signed by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on July 23, 2016 provides that ‘There shall be a legal presumption in favor of access to information, public records and official records’,” Cayosa said.
“The Freedom of Information E.O. acknowledges that ‘the incorporation of this right in the Constitution is a recognition of the fundamental role of free and open exchange of information in a democracy, meant to enhance transparency and accountability in government official acts, transactions, or decisions’.It states that ‘the Executive Branch recognizes the urgent need to operationalize these Constitutional provisions’,” he added.
Secretary Carllito Galvez Jr., vaccine czar and chief implementor of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), and other government officials have maintained that they could not divulge prices of the CoronaVac — the vaccine made by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac BioTech. It is one of the vaccines that will be used by the national government.The huge discrepancy between the selling prices of CoronaVac in the Philippines and in other countries prompted questions on whether the Philippines’ procurement is riddled with corruption — leading to calls for the publication of prices.
Last Sunday, Sen. Panfilo Lacson mentioned in a series of tweets that the Sinovac vaccine cost around $5, or around P240, per dose in some instances, but it costaround $38, or around P1,800, in the Philippines.
Galvez still refused to reveal the price of the vaccines, saying that it would endanger the government’s deal with Sinovac, to which it was bound by a nondisclosure agreement.
He did say that the vaccine cost was no more than P700.
Sen. Sonny Angara insisted, however, that the original vaccine price — which had skyrocketed to over P3,600 per two doses — was revealed by the Department of Health around November.
During his taped briefing on Monday, Duterte defended Galvez, assuring that the vaccine procurement was not riddled by corruption. He also justified the government’s adherence to the nondisclosure agreement, as it had been an “industry practice.”

https://globalnation.inquirer.net/190140/russia-ready-to-supply-ph-with-effective-safe-covid-19-vaccines-envoy,"Russia ready to supply PH with ‘effective, safe’ COVID-19 vaccines — envoy",Christia Marie Ramos,"07:03 PM August 07, 2020","MANILA, Philippines — Russia expressed readiness to supply the Philippines with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines, its envoy in Manila said Friday, adding that results of the trials are turning out “very promising.”
“The Russian side is ready to closely cooperate with the Philippine partners in this field,” Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev told reporters in an online press briefing.According to the ambassador, proposals for the clinical trials as well as the production of the vaccine in the Philippines have already been submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and [are] now “under consideration.”
“We have three options for cooperations. First, clinical trials, if our Philippine partners consider it necessary. The second option: We are ready to supply the vaccine to the Philippines. The third option is local production of vaccines here on Philippine soil,” Khovaev said.
“It means that we are ready to combine our efforts, we are ready to make necessary investments together with our Philippine partners and we are ready to share our technologies simply because we want to build a robust partnership between our two nations,” he added.
Russia is now only waiting for an official from the Philippine government, he said.
“We don’t make promises. We make suggestions. Suggestions based on what we already have, we have already done…Our offer is under consideration for our Philippine partners so we are waiting for the feedback,” he added.
‘Effective, safe’
Khovaev also gave assurances that the vaccine being developed by Russia is “effective and safe.”
He said the vaccine was tested on several volunteers and Russian scientists, all of whom have “healed well,” the envoy said.
“All of them were tested on these vaccines and all of them feel well,” he added.
“So, according to the analysis of our scientists, the results of the trials are very promising, very positive…The vaccine is effective and safe,” he further said.Moreover, Khovaev said his government is willing to comply with any necessary vaccine distribution procedure imposed by the Philippine government should Manila accept Russia’s offer.
“We fully understand that you Filipinos have your own procedures in this field and all these procedures should be complied with. Of course, we comply with all domestic procedures in the Philippines,” he added.
According to Khovaev, around 20 countries have already confirmed their interest to “closely cooperate” with Russia in terms of the COVID-19 vaccine.
When asked about the status of Russia’s offer to the Philippines, the DFA said the proposals have already been referred to the appropriate agencies “for proper assessment and evaluation.”
“The DFA conveys its appreciation for Russia’s willingness to assist the Philippines in its fight against COVID-19, as well as its offer to supply the SARS-COV-2 vaccine developed by N.F. Gamaleya of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation,” the DFA said in a message to reporters.
The Philippine government has already reached out to various COVID-19 vaccine developers from the United States, Taiwan, China, and the United Kingdom for possible purchase once vaccines have been found and become available.
Over 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are currently in development worldwide.
Earlier, Russia said it aims to launch mass production of a COVID-19 vaccine in September and turn out “several million” doses per month by next year.
But after Moscow announced plans to start swiftly producing COVID-19 jabs, the World Health Organization urged the said country to follow the established guidelines for producing safe and effective vaccines. (With reports from Reuters)

“I believe we are not late yet because we have ongoing negotiations with different leading (pharmaceutical) companies,” Galvez said during the weekly Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum on Wednesday.The former military explained that President Rodrigo Duterte’s clearance was needed to ensure that the government could make necessary advance payments and commitments on vaccine deals which is strictly prohibited by the country’s auditing laws.
Duterte has agreed to make advance market commitments and advance payments to private COVID-19 developers to ensure supply for the Philippines despite expressing reservations in September.
The Philippine government and private companies signed a supply agreement with British drugmaker AstraZeneca involving at least two million doses of its vaccine last week.
But Galvez expressed confidence that the country can achieve at least 50 million doses of vaccines by 2021.
The Philippines aims to vaccinate up to 60 percent of the population against COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity.
Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also looking into the vaccines of China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and Pfizer of the United States.

Ang ano nila is magbigay sila ng bakuna. Wala naman silang sinasabi bayaran mo. Ito, tingin ko kay President [Vladimir] Putin, tulong niya sa atin, libre,” Duterte said in a taped address.

Duterte said the number of supplies to be given is still in talks and noted that clinical studies will still have to be made.
The President said he would be the first to be experimented by volunteering to take it in public.
Duterte tasked the Department of Health to coordinate with Russia on the transfer of technology for a possible vaccine against COVID-19.
“I don’t think Russia will renege on its promise and so I am asking the Secretary of Health to look for the best guy to be dealing with Russia in this area–the transfer of technology of the vaccine,” Duterte said.
The President expressed thanks to Russia and assured that the two nations will remain “friends forever.”
Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev earlier said Russia is ready to supply the country with COVID-19 vaccines.
Khovaev assured the trials of the vaccine were turning out “promising” and that it is “effective and safe.”[ac]

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1397725/who-considering-3-covid-19-vaccines-in-solidarity-trials-dost,WHO considering 3 Covid-19 vaccines in solidarity trials — DOST,Cathrine Gonzales,"03:56 PM February 19, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering three Covid-19 vaccines for its solidarity trials, but the date on when this activity would commence remains uncertain, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) said Friday.“We were told that they [WHO] are down to three choices of vaccines and we will know soon kung kailan po mag-uumpisa itong trials [when the trials would start],” DOST Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara said in an online press briefing, but did not disclose which vaccines are being considered by the WHO.
According to Guevara, the occurrence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and other factors in the vaccines have contributed to the delay in the conduct of solidarity trials.
She said the country’s team for the solitary trials is ready and has been preparing for the activity since September last year.
“We have been in touch with the WHO solidarity vaccine trials global lead and we were informed that the vaccine selection from their end still has to be finalized,” she added.
“Malaki ang naging epekto kasi nitong paglabas ng variants at nakita din nila ‘yung mahirap kapag double dose ang ating mga vaccines [The occurrence of variants had a large effect and they saw that using double dose vaccines would be difficult], so they are trying to find better alternatives to the vaccines that are available,” she added.
As for preparations for the trials in the Philippines, Guevara said one of the challenges is the increased requirement in the number of staff for the initiative due to the increased number of trial sites and participants.
She noted that Covid-19 cases in Metro Manila are also changing, causing difficulty in identifying the final list of trial sites.
“The study vaccines are not yet released by the WHO including the final trial protocols and standard operating procedures, causing delay in the implementation of the trial,” she added.
Currently, available Covid-19 vaccines are only being administered through emergency use authorization (EUA), which allows the limited use of vaccines that are deemed safe and effective based on review of interim data of Phase 3 clinical trials.Guevara reiterated that the EUA is different from a product registration, which is being issued for new and approved vaccines that were proven safe and effective based on review of complete data from Phase 3 trials.
Outside the WHO solidarity trials, there are also vaccine manufacturers that have applied to conduct their independent clinical trials in the Philippines.
Guevara said Belgium-based Janssen Pharmaceuticals has already started its phase 3 clinical trials in the country, while trial site preparations are ongoing for Chinese firms Clover Biopharmaceuticals and Sinovac Biotech.

MANILA, Philippines — Following a delay, 487,200 doses ofCovid-19 vaccines developed by British-Swede pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca will arrive in the Philippines on Thursday, March 4, Malacañang said Wednesday.
“This is to confirm that the Philippines is set to receive 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines tomorrow, March 4, 2021, 7:30 PM, as part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX facility,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement.Some 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, but encountered delay due to “supply problems.”
President Rodrigo Duterte will personally witness the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility, Roque earlier said.
The Philippines is expected to receive at least 5.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca via the COVAX facility within the first quarter of 2021.
The country started on Monday its mass vaccination program to beat the further spread of Covid-19, following the delivery of 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s vaccine, CoronaVac, donated by the Chinese government.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1397180/why-is-ph-lagging-behind-in-covid-19-vaccination-senators-ask,Why is PH lagging behind in Covid-19 vaccination? Senators ask,Christia Marie Ramos,"09:26 AM February 18, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — Some senators on Thursday have questioned why the Philippines seems to be lagging behind its vaccination program, saying that the delivery date of vaccines to the country remains unclear amid the absence of any signed supply agreement.
“Nakakailang araw na tayong kaka-practice pero wala pa rin yung bakuna and they can’t give us a definite date when it is coming,” Senator Nancy Binay said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel.(We’ve already had days of practice but until now we don’t have the vaccines yet and they can’t give us a definite date when it is coming.)
“The mere fact na we only have term sheets at the moment, wala pa tayong supply agreement na pinipirmahan, the delivery of the vaccine will always be a question. At this point ang sigurado lang ay hindi sigurado kung kailan dadating yung bakuna,” she said.
(The mere fact that we only have term sheets at the moment and we have yet to sign any supply agreement,the delivery of the vaccines will always be a question. At this point the only thing that is sure is that it is still unsure when the vaccines will arrive.)
The government targets to roll out its Covid-19 mass immunization program within the first quarter of the year, eyeing to vaccinate at least 70 million Filipinos to achieve herd immunity and significantly arrest the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the potentially fatal respiratory illness.
“I think from day one when we had this problem, lagi tayong reactionary. Kumbaga at this point, hindi tayo makahabol do’n sa pag-solve natin sa problem natin sa Covid-19,” Binay also said.
(I think from day one when we had this problem, we have always been reactionary. That’s why at this point, we can’t keep up in solving our problem with Covid-19.)
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon also lamented that the Philippines is being “left behind” in the procurement and administration of Covid-19 vaccines.
“It is very disappointing. I am worried for the future of our country,” he said in a statement.
“Each day we fail to start the vaccination raises the risk of further spread of the virus and makes our economic recovery longer,” he added.Drilon pointed out that the Philippines is lagging behind its regional peers in the vaccination of its population.
“Many are baffled by our situation. Out of the 10 countries in Southeast Asia, six have already started inoculating their citizens,” the minority leader said.
Among the countries that have started rolling out jabs are Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, leaving the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, and Thailand behind, according to Drilon.
“Bakit tayo hanggang ngayon wala pa rin?” he asked.
(Why is it that until now, we don’t have the vaccines yet.)
The Philippines has already “locked-in” 108 million doses of vaccines through “term sheets” with different manufacturers.
The government, meanwhile, will likely sign “a few” supply agreements by the end of February.
“I cannot emphasize this enough: our survival as a nation largely depends on our ability to ensure immediate access and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines to our people. At the rate things are going, however, Filipinos have to wait longer,” Drilon went on.
Aside from the lack of confidence by Filipinos in Covid-19 vaccines, the senator said politics also poses a challenge to the government’s mass vaccination program against coronavirus.
“We must prevent the politicization of the Covid-19 vaccination. The Covid-19 vaccination program will not succeed if we inject politics,” Drilon said.

In a statement on Friday, the DOF said outgoing Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev mentioned during his farewell courtesy call to Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III last Tuesday “the possibility of producing and distributing in the Philippines the vaccine developed by Russia.”Early this month, Khovaev told a business forum that the bilateral deal, which Russia had proposed to the Philippine government involved joint clinical trials as well as immediate provisioning of vaccine supplies here after the third and final phases and regulatory approval.
The Philippines is supposedly being eyed to become the production hub for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine in Southeast Asia.
Besides cooperation in vaccine production, Russia and the Philippines were also eyeing “possible agreement on energy cooperation to help boost the Philippines’ power generation capacity,” the DOF said.
Dominguez had said last year that Russian investors were keen on developing power infrastructure projects, including wind farms, in the Philippines following President Duter­te’s visit to Russia.
At that time, the Philippines and Russia also signed a memorandum of intent to explore the possible construction of nuclear power plants here.
The President recently sought consultations to possibly reopen the mothballed Bataan nuclear power plant.
Another area of cooperation discussed by Dominguez and Khovaev was in tax administration, including “a possible cooperation agreement between the Philippine Bureau of Customs and the Federal Customs Service of Russia,” the DOF said.
Dominguez also asked Russia to help the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) establish an efficient value-added tax (VAT) collection system.
In turn, Khovaev was quoted by the DOF as saying that “Russia has shared its VAT-collection technology with other countries and would assist the BIR in its effort to improve its system.”

Dominguez III last Tuesday “the possibility of producing and distributing in the Philippines the vaccine developed by Russia.”Early this month, Khovaev told a business forum that the bilateral deal, which Russia had proposed to the Philippine government involved joint clinical trials as well as immediate provisioning of vaccine supplies here after the third and final phases and regulatory approval.The Philippines is supposedly being eyed to become the production hub for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine in Southeast Asia.The President recently sought consultations to possibly reopen the mothballed Bataan nuclear power plant.Another area of cooperation discussed by Dominguez and Khovaev was in tax administration, including “a possible cooperation agreement between the Philippine Bureau of Customs and the Federal Customs Service of Russia,” the DOF said.In turn, Khovaev was quoted by the DOF as saying that “Russia has shared its VAT-collection technology with other countries and would assist the BIR in its effort to improve its system.”Appetite for loans still weak for 5th straight month in August Hero Wars For Free.No install Hero Wars | Sponsored 48 Broke Celebrities Now Working Normal Jobs Genius-Story.com | Sponsored The Most Handsome Guys In Philippines On This Dating Site Perfect-Dating.com | Sponsored Play just 1 minute to find out why everyone loves this RPG!",1.0,0.8952999711036682,"vaccination, duterte, expert, trial, get, approve, emergency_use, first, astrazeneca, pfizer","['russian', 'love', 'affair', 'bring', 'energy', 'tie', 'ph']",0.743,0.0,0.442,0.558,0.3,Positive
https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1393695/1st-batch-of-vaccines-in-ph-next-week,First batch of vaccines in PH next week,Jerome Aning,"05:01 AM February 09, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — The initial batch of COVID-19 vaccines from the global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX is expected to arrive in the country by mid-February, Malacañang said on Monday as it gave an assurance that the government would be ready to launch its vaccination drive next week.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the government expected to hear from COVAX any time now on the exact date of the vaccines’ delivery, and said all preparations were in place once these arrived in the country.“The COVAX facility said it will arrive mid-February and as far as we’re concerned, as you can see from the report of the mayors, we are ready to begin the vaccination and we are ready to do it by Feb. 15,” Roque said at a press briefing.
He said the Philippines would be given notice of the impending delivery two to three days before the vaccines are loaded in the aircraft so that it would have time to prepare to receive these at the airport.
Initially from Pfizer
The initial shipment from the global procurement pool would be 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which would require subzero temperatures for storage, he said.
They would be kept in the Department of Health (DOH) warehouse before being distributed to COVID-19 referral hospitals, he said.
He also said Pfizer would be responsible for bringing the vaccines to the areas where these would be used.
President Rodrigo Duterte, who earlier expressed preference for the Chinese or Russian vaccine, will be given priority in the vaccination because he is a senior citizen, Roque said.
It is also important for him to get the shot to inspire public confidence, he said.
“We expect him to be among the first. Whether it is done publicly or privately will be his decision,” he said.
The DOH on Monday said local governments in Metro Manila and metropolitan Cebu and Davao must have set up their vaccination operation centers by Feb. 10.Speaking at an online briefing, Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje, who is in charge of the DOH public health service team, said the centers would be in charge of the vaccine rollout in local areas with contingency measures in place to address any problem.
“They will help us see the entirety to the implementation of the vaccine rollout. There will be planning, policy [awareness], dissemination of guidelines—there will just be one source of our information. There will be logistics [employees] who will be in charge of the vaccines, if the ancillaries are there,” Cabotaje said.

In a tweet, Locsin bared that he had a “great phone conversation” with Pompeo the night before.“Lotsa laughs at others. But on the most serious note I asked him to help Babe and I get back even a fraction of the 10 million doses of Pfizer after someone dropped the ball. He’ll give it his best try,” Locsin said.
It was also Locsin who previously bared that “someone dropped the ball” as the Philippines was supposed to get 10 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, however, denied that someone “dropped the ball” in acquiring the vaccines, saying that the government’s negotiation with Pfizer is ongoing.
Senator Panfilo Lacson, meanwhile, said that he was able to talk to Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez about the official to “dropped the ball” on the vaccine deal, adding that Duque was not able to work on the documentary requirements needed.
Aside from the Pfizer vaccine deal, Locsin also bared that the ambassador was also working on securing vaccine doses from Moderna.
Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine was the second to receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto announced this in a Facebook post on Sunday, as he noted that some local government units have also signed a tripartite agreement with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm and the national government.“Pasig has ordered 400K doses (100M pesos). Actual quantity and date of delivery will depend on several factors,” he said.
“We’ll buy from others as well as opportunities arise. This is to augment what the DOH will give us,” the mayor added.
Sotto earlier said the city government has allotted P300 million for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, but added that this amount may still increase.
The phase 1 of the vaccination program will benefit medical frontliners, while the phase 2 will be for senior citizens and persons with disabilities, according to a separate Facebook post from the Pasig City Public Information Office (PIO) on Monday.
“Habang isinasagawa ang Phases 1 at 2, bababa na rin ang team natin sa barangay para mag-validate ng iba pang magiging benepisyaryo. 100% FREE. Libre po nating ibabahagi ang bakuna,” the PIO added.
(While Phases 1 and 2 are being conducted, our team will go down to barangays to validate information on other beneficiaries. This will be given 100-percent free. The vaccines will be provided for free.)
As of January 8, Pasig City has already recorded a total of 9,915 COVID-19 cases, consisting of 185 active cases, 9,336 recoveries, and 394 deaths.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1399299/covid-19-vaccine-bill-now-up-for-dutertes-signature,COVID-19 vaccine bill now up for Duterte’s signature,Christia Marie Ramos,"10:07 PM February 23, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — A bill seeking to speed up the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the country and establish an indemnity fund now only needs the signature of President Rodrigo Duterte.
This, after the House of Representatives, adopted the Senate’s version of the proposed Covid-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021.During the House session on Tuesday, the lower chamber approved a motion to adopt Senate Bill No. 2057 as an amendment to House Bill No. 8648, passed on Monday.
READ: House OKs bill expediting Covid-19 vaccine purchase, creating indemnification fund
With the House’s concurrence with the Senate bill, a bicameral conference committee will no longer be needed to reconcile the disagreeing provisions of the chambers’ respective versions of the measure.
Under Senate Bill No. 2057, the national government, local government units (LGUs) and the private sector will be authorized to procure COVID-19 vaccines through the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) and the Department of Health (DOH).
READ: Senate OKs bill expediting vaccine purchase, creating indemnity fund
LGUs, on the other hand, will be allowed to directly procure the ancillary supplies and services necessary for the storage, transport, and deployment of the vaccines.
The measure will also exempt LGUs from certain provisions of the existing procurement laws.
Among the laws covered by the exemption are the Government Procurement Reform Act, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and the Local Government Code.
“The bill will provide legal cover to the LGUs, many of which have intimated to us their concern about possible adverse findings by the Commission on Audit and even graft cases that may be filed against their officials,” Senator Sonny Angara, sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.A significant number of LGUs have started preparing for the rollout of their respective vaccination programs and are waiting for the bill’s enactment to exempt them from the legal requirements regarding the procurement of goods, the senator noted.
For the private firms, their procurement of Covid-19 vaccines will be done in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through a multiparty agreement.
Meanwhile, a national indemnity fund will be established under the bill to compensate any individual inoculated through the Covid-19 vaccination program, in case of death or for the treatment of possible severe adverse effects.
The bill authorizes a P500-million augmentation, sourced from the Contingent Fund of the 2021 national budget to the existing funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth), which will manage the indemnity fund.
“The indemnity fund will cover the indemnification agreements with the vaccine manufacturers, which the NTF has started fulfilling. This removes one major stumbling block to the delivery of the vaccines to the country,” Angara said.
According to the senator, another provision of the bill seen to help bring in more Covid-19 vaccines and other critical supplies to the country is the exemption of its purchases from taxes and duties.
Vaccine cards
Under the bill, the DOH, LGUs and private entities will be required to issue “vaccine cards” to individuals who have been inoculated.
The cards will contain basic information about the individual; the manufacturer and brand of the vaccine administered; the date of vaccination; the date of last RT-PCR testing; and the facility’s names where the vaccine was received and the health professionals who administered the vaccine.
Senator Francis Tolentino introduced an amendment to the bill ensuring that the “vaccine card” to be issued by LGUs will not be considered a mandatory requirement in educational, employment, and similar government transaction purposes.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said that the country would receive at least two COVID-19 vaccines as early as February.Senator Panfilo Lacson then asked Galvez, during the hearing of the Senate Committee of the Whole, when the first COVID-19 vaccination would happen.
Galvez initially said it would be on February 20 but later clarified he was referring to the expected delivery of the vaccines.
“Ang tanong ko nga, kailan ‘yung unang bakuna? (My question is, when is the first vaccination?)” Lacson asked.
“…Para naman umasa ‘yung mga kababayan natin na sa February 28 or sa March 1 mababakunahan sila, pwede bang i-share mo lang sa amin kailan yung unang bakuna sa tantya mo?” he further asked.
(So that our countrymen can have hope that they could be vaccinated by February 28 or March 1, can you share with us when you think the first vaccination will be administered?)
At this point, Galvez told the committee that he expects the first vaccination in the Philippines to be on the “third or fourth week of February.”

In Executive Order No. 121 signed Dec. 1 and made public Wednesday, Duterte authorized the FDA director-general to issue a EUA to COVID-19 drugs or vaccines.The President also authorized the FDA director-general to “accept the regulatory decision of the [World Health Organization], [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], or other internationally recognized regulatory authorities.
With the FDA allowed to issue EUAs, the process of approving COVID-19 vaccines will be shortened from six months to 21 days.
According to the EO, conditions for the issuance of EUA to COVID-19 drug or vaccine are the following:
Based on the totality of evidence available, including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose or treat COVID-19;
The known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine when used to diagnose, prevent or treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug or vaccine if any; and
There is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the drug or vaccine for diagnosing, preventing or treating COVID-19
Earlier, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III asked the President to grant the FDA with EUA to “cut the red tape.”
Pfizer and Moderna are among the pharmaceutical firms who already applied for an EUA of their COVID-19 vaccines before U.S. health regulators.
Meanwhile, COVID-19 vaccines of China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute have already secured EUA from their respective governments.

MANILA, Philippines — Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi will be the first among workers in the hospital to receive on Monday the CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’sSinovac Biotech.
“The first recipient will be our director, Director Gap Legaspi, and thenthere are some other like Dr. Edsel Salvaña, he’s an infectious disease specialist and then there are other consultants here whom we think have probably a lot of convincing power,” Dr. Jonas del Rosario, PGH spokespersonsaid in an interview on ABS-CBN News Channel.Del Rosario, a Covid-19 survivor, was supposed to receive the first coronavirus vaccine but he said he was informed that the amount of his antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, is still high.
“They tested my antibodies again a couple of days [ago] and it was quite high. They told me you can wait, you are not the priority at this time,” he said.
Del Rosario said there are 100 identified vaccinees at the PGH this Monday.He also said that there are almost 6,000 vaccinees in PGH, regardless of the vaccine brand.
“Regardless of the vaccines, we have about almost close to 6,000 recipients. That would be from the doctors, nurses, down to support staff, administrative personnel, janitorial services, all of those about 6,000. So far we have as an allocation of 1,000 [doses] for Sinovac at least for the first few days just to see and if the numbers go up, we will ask for more,” he added.
The donated 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine from China arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, with the doses transported to the PGH, Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center early Monday morning.

https://opinion.inquirer.net/136192/covid-19-vaccines-in-the-philippine-context,COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippine context,Gideon Lasco,"05:05 AM December 16, 2020","Several months and over 400,000 COVID-19 cases later, the Philippines has begun its long-awaited and promised process of acquiring vaccines as a means to end the pandemic. As early as April, President Duterte spoke optimistically of the prospects of a vaccine. Realistically, however, we must be aware of the realities of vaccination in the recent past in order to truly ensure its success.
Before looking at the advances of COVID-19 vaccine technology, it is important to look at the role immunization has played in the Philippine health care system. Indeed, this has been one of the cornerstones of preventive care for disease not just of childhood (mumps, chickenpox) but eventual adult concerns (HPV, pneumonia) as well. Yet despite the government’s Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and the National Immunization Program (NIP), the country has seen a drop in population coverage, leading to the resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles, diphtheria, and even poliomyelitis in the past decade. The Philippines’ circulating vaccine-derived polio cases in 2019-2020 placed us on a list with African countries struggling to end the transmission of this disease.Many attribute the dismal immunization coverage to the dengue vaccine scandal, but while it doubtless eroded vaccines confidence in the Philippines, our immunization programs have actually been problematic long before Dengvaxia, failing to reach the coverage goal of 95 percent for many years now. The scandal only represented the nadir of what’s already been an alarming trend.
In fact, when it comes to timeliness of vaccination, the 2017 National Demographic and Health Survey showed only a 10.6 percent rate for all vaccines (ranging from 38 to 67 percent per vaccine). The gaps in delivery boil down to the quality and accessibility of our public health system, which, during the recent polio vaccinations, for instance, relied heavily on private sector support. It also faces a lot of challenges when it comes to maintaining the cold chain.
Looking forward to the COVID-19 vaccines, there have been major breakthroughs, the speed and complexity of which have never been encountered before. Of those nearing approval, there are two mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer—both requiring negative temperatures in their delicate handling. There are also the vector-based vaccines from Astra-
Zeneca and Gamaleya’s Sputnik V, as well as China’s inactivated vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac, all of which will only need normal refrigerated temperature.
Beyond the vaccine type, its corresponding handling, and the limitations of our health infrastructure, a major concern is the potential politicization of the acquisition, prioritization, and distribution protocols that will be put in place. There have been conflicting reports on who will be vaccinated first—health workers, vulnerable individuals, the poor, and uniformed personnel—according to different government agencies. There is also a need to address people’s concerns about the vaccines, from fears of being made “guinea pigs” to misconceptions about side effects and efficacy.
Surprisingly, there are reports of politicians having already received the vaccine, even if no emergency use authorizations have been granted by the local FDA. The vaccine “czar,” Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., also mentioned that equitable access to the vaccine will only be achieved by 2022—an election year, which may bring about a predicament not unlike that of Dengvaxia in 2016, which some quarters allege was funded and launched for political considerations. These issues once again raise the danger of politicizing vaccination, especially if the process for prioritization will have potential interference from vested interests. With the urgency called for by the still uncontrolled pandemic, the success of not just the COVID-19 vaccine, but also of the entire vaccination institution in our country, hangs in the balance.
In the end, however, the solution for COVID-19 goes beyond vaccination. The World Health Organization reminds governments of the continuous need to strengthen their countries’ health system to provide for adequate testing, tracing, quarantine, treatment, and monitoring, aside from the provision of essential services. States must invest in public health to strengthen the infrastructure for pandemic preparedness, and to ensure the well-being of all, now more than ever.

MANILA, Philippines — Health Secretary Francisco Duque III will not be inoculated with the CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’sSinovac, according to the Department of Health (DOH).“FTD (Francisco T. Duque) will not be vaccinated with SINOVAC as EUA (emergency use authorization) provisions exclude 60 and above. He also underscores that we will follow the prioritization framework, and will ensure that limited doses will go to the HCWs (healthcare workers) first,” the DOH told reporters in a Viber message on Sunday night.Duque, 64, earlier said he is willing to receive the CoronaVac, but added that the age restriction recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the vaccines from the Chinese firm may be an issue. On Sunday, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go also said that Duque and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. will be vaccinated on Monday morning with the Covid-19 vaccine from Sinovac. FDA Director-General Eric Domingo earlier said that the CoronaVac, despite getting a local EUA, should only be administered to clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old, as the vaccine showed higher efficacy rates in this age group.He said that the vaccine showed a higher efficacy rate of 65.3 percent among clinically healthy people within this age bracket based on clinical trials in Indonesia, and 91.2 percent based on clinical trials in Turkey. The donated 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine from China arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, with the doses transported to the Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center early Monday morning.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1380514/ph-seeks-148m-doses-from-7-drugmakers,PH seeks 148 million doses from 7 COVID-19 vaccine makers,Jerome Aning,"05:32 AM January 07, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines is negotiating with seven vaccine manufacturers to procure at least 148 million doses as it seeks to inoculate close to two-thirds of its population this year, according to the head of the country’s national vaccination program and chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.
Speaking at the Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday, Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government was hoping to close deals with Novavax, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson of the United States, United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac Biotech and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute.“Based on our current negotiations, we will be able to purchase at least 148 million doses from more or less seven manufacturers. However, it will be dependent on the global supply,” he said.
“The government will have a portfolio of vaccines,” he said. “This means we will get vaccines from different manufactures. This is to ensure that we we will have vaccines for everyone, particularly this year 2021.”
Full subsidy
Galvez said the Philippines also would receive fully subsidized doses for around 23 million Filipinos through the Covax Facility, which is aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide equitable access to all countries to safe and effective vaccines, once these are licensed and approved.
Covax is led jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the Geneva-based Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.
Galvez said the Philippines and Colombia would be the first two countries to take part in the solidarity trial of the WHO for COVID-19 vaccine candidates set also for this month.
He said as many as 15,000 volunteers from Metro Manila would participate in the clinical trial, which would be implemented by the Department of Science and Technology and the Philippine General Hospital.
“This is so that we can have a full evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine,” he said.
The former military chief of staff did not disclose the candidate vaccines that would be used in the trial.
The Philippines had earlier targeted 80 million doses and though it has been talking with vaccine-makers for months, the country had secured only 2.6 million, from AstraZeneca, paid for by a private sector group, which will give half of the shots to their employees.Priority recipients
On Wednesday, AstraZeneca applied for an emergency use authorization for its vaccine in the Philippines.
Galvez said the priority recipients of the vaccines have already been designated—health-care workers, vulnerable indigent senior citizens, [residents of] poor communities, uniformed personnel, teachers and school workers, government workers, overseas Filipino workers and other essential workers.
A “whole-of-nation” approach will also be undertaken to involve local governments and the private sector in the vaccination program.
He said the local governments would help in identifying the priority vaccine recipients, while the private sector would provide technical and financial support for storage and deployment.
Even though the government- provided vaccines are going to be free, people will have to volunteer to be inoculated and local governments have to convince their constituents to have themselves inoculated.
Trust level
In San Juan City, Mayor Francis Zamora said the important thing was to “increase the trust level” of residents on vaccines.
“Right now, we understand that there is still some skepticism surrounding COVID-19 vaccines because these are newly developed,” he said.
At least 4,109 of an estimated 122,000 San Juan residents had signed up for vaccination as of Tuesday afternoon, just a day after the city government announced opened the registration.
Zamora was hopeful that more of his constituents would sign up for an orderly and fast roll out of vaccines, and that the city would be able to ease the vaccination process as early as April.
He said the city would prioritize the inoculation of health workers and front-liners to be vaccinated first, followed by indigent senior citizens and other residents who registered.
The city council last year passed Ordinance No. 75 allocating P50 million for vaccine procurement.
According to Zamora, the money was “more than enough” because the national government would also be giving funds to local governments for their vaccine needs.
He said he preferred a vaccine with a high efficacy rate, made by a company that had a “good reputation” and met the standards set by local and international agencies.

According to Duterte, the United States and some countries in Europe, where the pharmaceutical companies are based, have already made a down payment on the vaccines to reserve them for their own citizens.So funding is not a problem, he said, with Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez assuring him that the government would be able to secure another loan for $300 million.
“As long as someone would lend us money, no problem about it,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino. “How long? In due time. It’s not that we don’t want to buy. There’s still nothing for us to buy.”
“So you can expect that in the few months until next year, all of those vaccines produced will be used by the Americans. Same story with the European countries who have successfully developed a vaccine,” he added.
And it’s the same situation with China, which Duterte said last April would prioritize the Philippines in the provision of vaccines.
“Again, we have to keep in mind that they have a population to worry [about], and that population is not easy,” the President said.
China would take care of its own citizens first before they give vaccines to others, he added.
Meanwhile, Duterte remained optimistic that the government could afford to shoulder the inoculation of the country’s poorest.
Filipinos with more money, he pointed out, would be able to “buy the medicines for themselves.”

According to Joseph Juico, co-chair of the city’s COVID-19 Task Force, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte is eyeing a P1 billion fund for vaccine procurement.
“We would like them to know that Quezon City government would be setting aside a budget for procurement to help the national government because I know it’s a daunting task,” Juico said in a television interview over ABS-CBN News.
“When I had a conversation with the mayor, she was thinking of around one billion pesos, but that will be spread out to also procure other items that will help supplement our vaccine initiatives such as the procurement of syringes, gloves, PPEs (Personal Protective Equipment), putting up of vaccine stations and so on,” he added.
The city council on December 5 approved the resolution which authorizes Belmonte to enter into a tripartite agreement with the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and AzraZeneca Pharmaceuticals Philippines for the advance purchase of the vaccine.

Galvez reiterated that the Chinese government has also pledged to donate 400,000 more doses of COVID-19 vaccine, in addition to the 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac that were earlier donated to the Philippines.“Meron po tayong naprocure na 1 million na darating po sa (We have procured 1 million doses arriving on) March 21 and then with the generosity of the Chinese government, another 400,000 will be given to us, so 1.4 million ang darating (we have 1.4 million doses) coming this March,” he said during the vaccine rollout at the QualiMed Hospital in Sta.

FDA Director-General Eric Domingo earlier said that CoronaVac’s efficacy rate on healthcare workers stands at 50.4 percent based on clinical trials conducted in Brazil, making it not the best vaccine to be given to medical frontliners exposed to COVID-19 patients.
He added that the Sinovac vaccine, despite getting an emergency use authorization from the local FDA, should only be administered to clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old, citing a higher efficacy rate of 65.3 percent among clinically healthy people within this age group based on clinical trials in Indonesia, and 91.2 percent based on clinical trials in Turkey.

https://business.inquirer.net/317831/indemnity-for-vaccine-side-effects,Indemnity for vaccine side effects,Raul J. Palabrica,"04:01 AM February 16, 2021","The delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines is being held in abeyance pending Congress’ enactment of an indemnification law.
That statement was made by Carlito Galvez Jr., the government’s point person on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, in a Senate hearing last week. He said that law was aimed at giving compensation to persons who may develop serious side effects from the vaccine.Under the proposed law, an indemnity fund would be established by companies that would supply the government with COVID-19 vaccines by depositing one percent of their contract price with the national treasury. The fund would be managed by a Vaccines Compensation Board.
By requiring an indemnification law prior to the delivery of its vaccine, Pfizer wants to shield itself from possible damage suits in case its vaccine gives rise to serious medical issues to its recipient.
If Pfizer’s indemnification scheme passes muster in Congress, all suppliers of government-authorized COVID-19 vaccines would benefit from it.
The law would, in effect, shift the burden of compensating Filipinos who may suffer from vaccine-related illnesses from the pharmaceutical companies to the government.
Pfizer cannot be faulted for thinking ahead before delivering its vaccine. Apparently, it does not want to find itself in the situation that fellow pharmaceutical company, Sanofi Pasteur Inc., is in at present in connection with deaths allegedly caused by Sanofi’s dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia.
Recall that in 2017, Persida Acosta, the head of the Public Attorney’s Office, filed civil and criminal suits against the local branch of Sanofi and former officials of the Department of Health who approved Dengvaxia’s use. The cases are still pending in court.
The business sector should take interest in the proposed indemnification fund. Although the COVID-19 vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies have received approval from their regulators, there are lingering doubts about their efficacy to persons at certain age levels and to virus variants that have recently emerged.
Despite those concerns, however, some private companies have been making arrangements, on their own, with pharmaceutical companies.
Due to the delicate nature of the vaccine, not to mention its high cost, it is reasonable to assume these companies will strictly comply with the prescribed protocols on their delivery, storage and injection.If none of the employees who were injected do not suffer any serious side effects, well and good. The company and its employees can enjoy the comfort of a safe work environment.
But sometimes good intentions do not translate to good results.
In case (knock on wood) an employee injected with the vaccine develops serious medical side effects, would the company be obliged to provide him or her with the medical treatment needed to bring him or her back to good health?
Strictly speaking, since the side effects came from the vaccine administered by the company, it can be held liable for the adverse effects of the injection. That would mean paying for the employee’s hospital bills and medicines and, probably, giving him or her leave with pay.
The unintended or unexpected consequences of a vaccine gone wrong could put an additional financial burden on any company, more so if it is hardly able to keep its nose out of the water.
If only for humanitarian reasons, however, desisting from giving employees the vaccine when the company can afford it because of possible post-injection expenses may not be a good move.
In anticipation of any government-approved vaccine procured by the companies for their employees could result in serious medical side effects, the business sector should lobby in Congress for the inclusion of their employees in the indemnification fund.
The fact that the companies did not go through the government procurement system in securing vaccines should not disqualify their staff from enjoying the benefits of the fund. The companies should even be commended for not using government funds to buy the vaccines.
Lest we forget, employees of private companies are Filipino citizens, too, who are entitled to assistance and protection from the government. INQ

MANILA, Philippines — Some 38,400 doses of vaccines developed by British-Swede pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, the National Task Force against COVID-19 said.
These vaccines were from the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX facility, a global vaccine pool that ensures equitable access to COVID-19 jabs in developing countries.The additional AstraZeneca vaccines are part of the 525,600 doses promised by the COVAX facility to the Philippines.
But on March 4, only 487,200 doses arrived in the country.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had explained this was due to the cargo limitations as the vaccines were transported via a commercial flight.
The Philippines is expecting to receive at least 5.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX facility in the first quarter of the year.

The practice is held in preparation for the rollout of Pfizer and Sinovac vaccines expected to arrive this month, but the deliveries will be delayed due to paperwork for indemnification required by the World Health Organization-led vaccine pool for Pfizer and by China’s requirement of emergency use authorization for Sinovac. —RICHARD A. REYES
The delivery of Pfizer and Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines to the country, scheduled for this month, is facing more delays.
Even if the Philippines has submitted the indemnification agreement required by the COVAX vaccine pool of the World Health Organization (WHO), Pfizer-BioNTech still has to submit its own indemnification agreement that also has to be signed before the delivery can start, according to WHO representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe. “What the Philippines signed is the COVAX indemnification agreement. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for an indemnification agreement coming from the manufacturer, in this case it’s Pfizer-BioNTech,” Abeyasinghe said at the televised public briefing on Thursday.Agreement not sent out
The Pfizer-BioNTech agreement has not been sent out to any of the countries involved in the early rollout, Abeyasinghe said.
He said COVAX and the GAVI vaccine alliance were working closely with Pfizer-BioNTech to make sure it would send out the indemnification agreement.
The indemnification agreement would absolve manufacturers of liability in case of adverse effects of vaccines, which have been authorized only for emergency use.
Carlito Galvez Jr., who is in charge of the government’s vaccine program, said the Philippines had signed the indemnification agreements for COVAX and the different manufacturers, and only needed Pfizer and AstraZeneca to submit their own indemnification agreements.
Galvez said there were two kinds indemnification agreements for COVAX, a generic one and a specific indemnification clause that must be signed by both the manufacturer and the Philippine government.
He noted that the delay in the delivery of vaccines from COVAX is not just in the Philippines but worldwide.
The Philippines is expecting an initial delivery of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from COVAX this month. These were supposed to arrive mid-February but were delayed, with officials citing the need to sign the indemnity agreements.
The Philippines is also awaiting the delivery of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine donated by China, but these may no longer arrive on Feb. 23 as had been expected.
Still no FDA approvalChina would deliver the vaccines to the Philippines only if the drug maker, Sinovac Biotech, got an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), according to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.
“I have received information that unless the [emergency use authorization] is delivered today, the delivery on the 23rd may be delayed,” Roque said.
But it would be better to wait for the permit so that the vaccines could be used immediately once these arrived, he said. And if the application for the permit is denied, then at least the Philippines knows it could not use the Sinovac vaccine, he added.
The FDA said it could not give a time frame for the grant of emergency use authorization to Sinovac.
“We are still evaluating their latest submissions. I can’t give a time frame until all submissions are evaluated,” FDA chief Eric Domingo told the Inquirer in a text message.
The delay triggered comparison between the Philippines and the poorer South Asian country Bangladesh, which has already started vaccinating its citizens.
But Galvez said the vaccines used in Bangladesh were donated by its neighbor India.
“We cannot inject donated vaccines without an [emergency use authorization],” he said.Despite these developments, Galvez said he believed it was still possible for the country’s vaccination drive to start this month. “Realistically, February is still possible,” he said.
The emergency use authorization for Sinovac could be issued and the COVAX vaccines could be delivered, he said. Galvez said his team would meet with officials from Pfizer Global on Friday.
Vaccines from South Korea
As for the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said his team was negotiating with AstraZeneca Philippines, expecting that the vaccines to be procured by the government and those to be donated through COVAX would be supplied by AstraZeneca Thailand.
The team, however, learned a few days ago that the vaccines would come from AstraZeneca South Korea instead.
Galvez said Serum Institute of India, which also manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine, was ready to supply the Philippines, but it was following a manufacturing system that had designated countries to supply.
“This means there is a supply problem,” he said.
Under the government’s plan, the initial rollout of the vaccines is expected in the first quarter of the year, with workers in government-run hospitals, elderly people, and uniformed personnel as the priority groups.
Some 5 million to 10 million doses are expected to arrive in the first two quarters of the year, Galvez said. The full rollout is scheduled in the third quarter, when the bulk of the vaccines is expected to be delivered.
The government aims to vaccinate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year.
Galvez also said there was still time to train vaccinators for the rollout since the vaccines would not arrive in the country at the same time.
He said he had directed local governments to prepare vaccination sites and to recruit and train people to administer the vaccines. —WITH REPORTS FROM MARICAR CINCO, PATRICIA DENISE M. CHIU AND JEROME ANING

MANILA, Philippines — Sinovac will deliver “sooner” the 600,000 doses of coronavirus vaccine that the Chinese government has promised to donate to the Philippines, the drugmaker’s general manager said Wednesday.
“Actually, the products [are] already there, we are managing the procedures of making the delivery and we will expect Philippines will be one of the important countries we’re going to supply the products,” Sinovac general manager Helen Yang said in an interview over ABS-CBN News Channel when asked when its vaccines will be delivered to the country.Yang did not state a specific date for the vaccines’ arrival, though she said “it will be soon.”
“We’re working very hard in order to make it happen. We’ll try our best. We will do it sooner,” Yang said.
On Monday, Sinovac’s vaccine secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
The FDA, however, did not advise Sinovac’s vaccine to be administered on senior citizens and health workers treating Covid-19 patients.
The country’s National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), a group of medical experts, is said to be discussing the prioritization scheme on vaccination considering FDA’s recommendation.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1364963/ph-vaccination-goal-70-of-pinoys-in-5-yrs,PH COVID-19 vaccination goal: 70% of Pinoys in 5 years,Jerome Aning,"05:32 AM November 26, 2020","MANILA, Philippines — The government hopes to vaccinate for the new coronavirus 60 to 70 percent of all Filipinos — enough to trigger herd immunity — within three to five years, the chief of the COVID-19 task force said on Wednesday.
Speaking at a news briefing, Undersecretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government could only vaccinate 20 million to 30 million people a year, and he estimated that P73 billion would be initially spent for the effort, not only to buy the required two doses for each citizen but also to cover “ancillary costs,” such as syringes and mobilization.Galvez, chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19, said the sources of the P73 billion—loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank—might be “unlocked” by December.
“So rest assured that the funds to be used will be prepared this coming December,” he said, adding that as the task force was considering various options in placing advance orders for vaccines, it was actually preparing to spend P70 billion to P150 billion.
Priority recipients
He said the Department of Health (DOH) had given the task force a list of 35 million Filipinos who would be the priority recipients of the chosen vaccine.
Those people, he said, include health-care workers, police and military personnel and other servicemen, essential workers from the social welfare and education departments and other government agencies, the elderly and the poor.
The task force plans to make the distribution of vaccines geographical, Galvez said, adding that the worst-hit areas—Metro Manila, Calabarzon and Central Luzon, and the cities of Cebu, Davao and Cagayan de Oro—will get priority so that “we can immediately feel the [vaccines’] effect, and if this happens life will return to normal in these centers of the economy.”
Galvez said the mass vaccinations could start in the second quarter or middle of 2021 at the earliest, which he described as the “best-case scenario.” At the latest, which he called the “worst-case scenario” but also the “realistic scenario,” it could start at the end of 2021 or early 2022.
The government is negotiating with foreign governments and vaccine makers for vaccine supplies, Galvez said.
He said Philippine officials were talking not only with the governments of Russia, China, United States and United Kingdom but also with the governments of Australia and India for vaccine supplies.
“[For our plan to] vaccinate 60 million Filipinos, we are getting the portfolio of access to different vaccine producers [in] the countries where the vaccines will come from, and we have at least five to six where the vaccines can be sourced,” Galvez said.No storage problem
Galvez gave assurance that storing the vaccines would not be a problem, given that the task force had six months to plan the logistics.
For vaccines that need to be stored in near-zero or freezing-point temperatures, Philippine hospitals will be able to manage, he said. For vaccines that require storage in negative 20 to negative 80 degrees Celsius, the task force will negotiate with consortiums that can provide the storage units, he said.
Whatever vaccine would be chosen by the Philippines would need approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Galvez said.
The government’s vaccine expert panel will now start evaluating AstraZeneca’s application to hold clinical trials in the Philippines of its candidate vaccine, which has been found to be on average 70 percent effective against the coronavirus.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Wednesday that the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company completed documentary requirements last week, clearing the way for the start of the regulatory process for its clinical trial. She, however, did not say when AstraZeneca will start the trial.
Five pharmaceutical companies are applying to test their candidate vaccines on Filipinos.
Apart from AstraZeneca, the companies are China’s Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and the United States’ Johnson&Johnson.
Only Sinovac has reached the more advanced stage of the regulatory process as it awaits the ethics board’s approval of its clinical trial.
Locally tried vaccine
Earlier, Vergeire said the government preferred buying a vaccine developed by a company that had tried the drug in the country. She explained that because vaccines work differently across ethnicities, testing a vaccine on Filipinos gives the government the opportunity to see how the candidate vaccine may affect the population.
Initial results on the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University showed 90 percent efficacy among patients who received half a dose of the vaccine, followed by a full dose at least a month apart.
For those who received two full doses of the vaccine at least a month apart, efficacy was 62 percent, resulting in an average efficacy of 70 percent.
While the vaccine breached the World Health Organization’s benchmark efficacy of 50 percent, the UN body said more data on its safety and efficacy were needed since the initial results were based on only more than 11,000 participants from the United Kingdom and Brazil.
In a statement, AstraZeneca said it expected to enroll up to 60,000 participants in its large-scale Phase 3 trials. The planned trial in the Philippines and other Asian and European countries will complement the ones being conducted in the United States, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Kenya and Latin America.
Although the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be sold at cost and is logistically compatible with the Philippines, Vergeire said it was still too early to say that this was the most practical and ideal vaccine for the country.
“We still need to see the technical details of the vaccine. Everything has to be taken into this complete context wherein we study everything — specific and very critical is to see the performance of this vaccine, based on the evaluation of our experts,” she said.

According to Galvez, the global vaccination figure has reached 300 million, with seven million people being vaccinated per day.“We are happy that the Philippines is part of those numbers and that we have already administered more or less 44,000 doses,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino.
Galvez said many people were requesting “almost every day” allocations of the vaccines, an indication of their willingness to get immunized against the deadly respiratory disease.
“When we had the vaccination of hospital directors, their level of confidence increased,“ he said.
The Philippines kicked off its COVID-19 vaccination program last Monday, after the arrival of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the vaccine produced by China’s Sinovac BioTech.
The first to get vaccinated was the director of the Philippine General Hospital, Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi.
Also last week, over 400,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered.
Earlier, Malacañang said more than 29,000 individuals had been vaccinated against COVID-19.

https://business.inquirer.net/314077/ph-adb-in-talks-for-400-500m-vaccine-procurement-financing,"PH, ADB in talks for $400-500M vaccine procurement financing",Ben O. de Vera,"03:45 PM December 16, 2020","MANILA, Philippines — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will lend to its host-country the Philippines at least $9.4 billion — possibly including about $400-500 million for COVID-19 vaccine procurement — in the next three years so the economy can bounce back from what seemed to be a slow recovery from the pandemic-induced recession so far.
ADB vice president Ahmed M. Saeed said in a statement Wednesday, about two-thirds of the Manila-based multilateral lender’s Country Operations Business Plan 2021–2023 for the Philippines will support financing for infrastructure development, health care, and jobs recovery.Oscar Amiel A. Badiola, senior programs officer at the ADB’s Philippines country office, told a press briefing Wednesday that the lender extended to the Philippines a record-high $4.2 billion across 11 loans, of which the bulk had been geared towards immediate COVID-19 response.
For 2021, the ADB plans to lend the Philippines a total of $3.57 billion across seven programs and projects, plus $800-million worth in five projects still on standby.
Among the loans up for ADB approval next year were the $1.75-billion South Commuter Railway Project, Tranche 1; $500-million Building Up Implementation and Local Level Drivers for Universal Health Care; $400-million Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition, Subprogram 3; $400-million Local Governance Reform Program, Subprogram 2; $238-million Davao Public Transport Modernization Project; $180-million Metro Manila Bridges Project; and $100-million Sustainable Tourism Development Project.
The projects on standby for possible ADB financing next year included the $400-million Integrated Flood Risk Management Sector Project, Phase 1, and $100 million in loans each for the following: Baguio City Sanitation Improvement Project; Integrating Innovation System in Philippine Technical and Vocational Education and Training; Mindanao Agro-Enterprise Development Project; and Mindanao Irrigation Development Project, Phase 1.
Also, country director for the Philippines Kelly Bird said the ADB and the Philippine government were currently in talks to tap the new $9-billion Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), under which member-countries can borrow $400-500 million for their COVID-19 vaccine procurement and rollout, next year.
In case their discussions with the Philippines prosper, Bird said the APVAX financing will be over and above the ADB’s 2021 lending pipeline. “We are committed to supporting the Philippines in financing COVID-19 vaccines,” he said.
Bird said the availability of vaccines will be a “big game-changer” to the economic outlook as inoculation would accelerate the resumption of business and consumer confidence upon containing the deadly coronavirus.
The ADB projected a record 8.5-percent contraction in the Philippines’ gross domestic product (GDP) this year before a rebound of 6.5-percent growth next year.
For 2022, the ADB’s pipeline of loans for the Philippines amounted to at least $2.92 billion, on top of a slightly bigger $2.95 billion in 2023.Bird noted that while there were “promising” green shoots being observed in recent manufacturing, goods exports, consumer spending, and cash remittances data, the recovery thus far had been “slow and fragile.”
The longest and most stringent COVID-19 lockdown in the region not only pushed the economy into a recession but also would inflict a severe impact on the labor market and reverse gains in poverty reduction, Bird said.
The ADB expects the unemployment rate to remain elevated at 8-9 percent during the first half of next year, Bird said, as the bigger share of new jobs were expected to be “lower quality” employment in the informal sector.
As such, the poverty incidence rate may rise to 20.7 percent this year from a low of 16.7 percent in 2018, Bird added.

(Screengrab from Senate Youtube livestream)
MANILA, Philippines — The Senate Committee of the Whole on Monday opened its inquiry on the government’s COVID-19 vaccination plan.
Senators will be asking officials about the details of the government’s plan with the P72.5-billion funding allocated for the COVID-19 vaccines under the 2021 national budget.RELATED STORY: Explainer: Facts about 7 COVID-19 vaccines Philippines may get
RELATED STORY: TIMELINE: The scuttled COVID-19 vaccine deal with Pfizer
The Senate’s hearing comes in light of several controversies surrounding the government’s inoculation plan.
In December, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III was accused of “dropping the ball” in the country’s deal with US drug maker Pfizer, which would have secured the delivery of 10 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines this month.
Meanwhile, the PresidentialSecurity Group (PSG)found itself in hot water after it was revealed that some members received a COVID-19 jab despite regulators not yet authorizing the use of a vaccine in the country.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III, who will be leading the inquiry as chair of the Committee of the Whole, earlier said he would not stop his fellow senators from raising the controversial vaccination of PSG personnel during the hearing.

Sotto, however, said no official connected to the said issue was invited to Monday’s hearing “because it’s not [on] the agenda.”
Cabinet officials who have confirmed attendance in the hearing are vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Rolando Domingo, according to a document provided by Sotto’s office over the weekend.
Other officials who confirmed their attendance were Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Interior Secretary Eduardo Año and Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato dela Peña.
Galvez previously said the government hopes to vaccinate 60 to 70 percent of Filipinos against the coronavirus — enough to trigger herd immunity—within three to five years.
The government is banking on the Sinovac vaccine from China to be the first to reach the Philippines with officials saying it may arrive in the first quarter of 2021.The government is looking to secure up to 25 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine.
The country has so far formally secured 2.6 million doses of vaccine from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which are expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021.
The Philippines has so far logged485,797 COVID-19 cases.Over 449,000 have recovered while 9,398 have died.

MANILA, Philippines — If reports turn out true, Malacañang said Monday it is “good” that some 100,000 Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (Pogo) workers in the Philippines were already vaccinated against COVID-19 as this means there are now less possible carriers of the virus.
“Wala po akong impormasyon. Kung totoo man, eh ‘di mabuti. [So] 100,000 less possible carriers of the COVID-19,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in an online Palace briefing when sought to comment on the matter.(I don’t have any information. But if it is true, then good. [There will be] 100,000 less possible carriers of the COVID-19.)
“Regarding the 100,000, unless they came back to China and had the vaccination here in China as to whether they were brought out of China, I cannot confirm or deny. I certainly don’t know,” Philippine Ambassador to China Jose “Chito” Sta. Romana said in the same briefing.
Chinese Filipino civic leader Teresita Ang See reportedly bared that some 100,000 Pogo workers in the Philippines have been inoculated against COVID-19.
This, despite the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given no approval yet on any vaccine.
Meanwhile, the FDA already launched an investigation on the vaccination of some government officials, members of the Presidential Security Group and other military men.
The National Bureau of Investigation was also ordered to look into the possible smuggling of unregistered COVID-19 vaccines in the country.

FDA director-general Eric Domingo said they don’t have information yet on which port in the country the Moderna vaccines were supposedly delivered.“We have no info on it. Our enforcement unit is still checking the reports,” he said in a text message to INQUIRER.net.
Asked about the possible application of Moderna for a EUA in the country, Domingo said: “Yes, I think they will apply next week.”
To date, only Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca have so far secured EUA in the Philippines, which is being required for available Covid-19 vaccines to be legally administered in the country.
The Philippines is set to receive 20 million doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, with Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Romualdez earlier saying that the vaccines from the company may be delivered in mid-2021.

MANILA, Philippines — Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Wednesday said the COVID-19 vaccines administered to some members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) were smuggled since the Food and Drug Administration has not authorized its use.
He said the PSG must explain their use of unauthorized vaccines, saying that the inoculation of some of PSG members “violated FDA rules.”“Yes, it’s smuggled kasi hindi authorized na pumasok dito (Its emtry in the country is not authorized).Only the government can authorize that through the FDA,” he said in an interview at the sidelines of Rizal Day celebration in Manila.
“Kailangan ipaliwanag ng PSG because they violated FDA rules. Explain ng PSG bakit ginawa ‘yun,” Lorenzana added.
(The PSG should explain why they did it.)
He added that he doesn’t know who donated the vaccines, which were reportedly developed by Chinese drugmaker Sinopharm.
He said he only knew about the vaccination after Duterte’s close-in security were vaccinated.

Lorenzana, however,said he does not think the entry of unauthorized COVID-19 vaccines in the country is a breach of security since the intention of the PSG was good.
“Maganda layunin (The intention is good), everybody is safe from COVID-19,” he said.
Still, Lorenzana, pointed out that FDA rules must be strictly followed.
He said the agency must expedite the approval of COVID-19 vaccines so that the country could start importing.“Ang dapat gawin ng FDA, madaliin pag-approve para makapag-import na ang legitimate importers and government kasi nagva-vaccine na sa ibang lugar. FDA should fasttrack,” Lorenzana said.
(The FDA should expedite its approval of COVID-19 vaccines so that legitimate importers could start importing.)
In a separate interview on Wednesday, PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III revealed that the inoculation of some PSG members was done among themselves, without the help of a medical professional. #

MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has reserved six million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Johnson & Johnson, Manila’s top diplomat in the United States said Monday.
Philippine Ambassador to the U.S. Jose Romualdez, the Philippine government is currently in talks with the company.“Kausap na natin yung Johnson & Johnson. Alam natin na in-approve lang yan dito sa America. Meron tayong six million na naka-reserve sa Johnson & Johnson,” Romualdez said in an interview over Teleradyo.
(We are talking with Johnson & Johnson. We know they just received authorization here in the US. We have six million doses reserved.)

He said the vaccine doses could be delivered to the country by the second half of the year.
“Iyan dadating ng mga second half of this year siyempre kasi yung production diyan e medyo ngayon pa lang maguumpisa ng full production,” the envoy said.
(These will arrive in the second half of this year, of course, because they just started their full production.)
Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose Covid-19 vaccine recently secured an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In Johnson & Johnson’s 44,000-person global trial, the vaccine was found to be 66% effective at preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 four weeks after inoculation, and 100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death due to the virus.
There were very few serious side effects reported in the trial, which also offered preliminary evidence that the vaccine reduced asymptomatic infections.
If that proves to be the case, it would mean COVID-19 vaccines may indeed reduce virus transmission as well as illness.So far, the Philippines has received 600,000 doses of the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China-based Sinovac as a donation from the Chinese government.
The country was also supposed to receive 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine on Monday as part of the first round of allocated doses from the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility.
The delivery, however, will be delayed by one week due to global supply issues, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said. With a report from Reuters

“As of yesterday, a total of 8,559 individuals have received the first doses of the Sinovac vaccine, which were administered from March 1 to March 3 in 32 different sites in the National Capital Region,” Nograles said in an online briefing.The Philippines began its COVID-19 vaccination program after receiving 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine, CoronaVac, donated by the Chinese government.
Of the 600,000 doses, Nograles said 189,600 have already been delivered in various vaccination centers across the country.
“At this point, we acknowledge that we have countrymen who still have reservations about receiving vaccines; but we believe that our kababayan should take their cue from the doctors, nurses, and medical personnel who have received the first doses of the vaccine,” Nograles said.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said the government is eyeing to vaccinate all health workers in the country within this month.
The Philippines expects to receive on Thursday night 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines donated from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility.

https://business.inquirer.net/316094/recovery-at-risk-due-to-slow-covid-vaccine-plan,Recovery at risk due to slow COVID vaccine plan,Ben O. de Vera,"04:11 AM January 20, 2021","While multilateral lenders have committed to jack up loan financing so the Philippines can buy COVID-19 vaccines, the government’s procurement has been the slowest in the region so far such that economists worry that an economic rebound would also lag.
The latest World Bank documents showed the Washington-based lender’s upcoming additional financing for the Philippines’ COVID-19 Emergency Response Project to be implemented by the Department of Health was raised to $400 million as of Jan. 16 from $300 million previously.As such, the total commitment across 14 loans in the World Bank’s near-term lending pipeline for the Philippines rose to $2.9 billion.
Besides the World Bank loan for vaccine procurement and distribution, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank has also committed $325 million under its Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility while the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is reviewing financing requests from member-countries, including the Philippines.
Despite a flurry of available financing, Citigroup managing director and head of Asia-Pacific economic and market analysis Johanna Chua told a webinar organized by debt watcher Fitch Ratings on Tuesday that the Philippines was a laggard in the region in purchasing COVID-19 vaccines.
“When it comes to vaccine procurement and we kind of track the supply, I think the Philippines is actually the one with the least procurement. In Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Singapore seems to be a little bit ahead, and then Thailand’s a little bit more than Malaysia [which was] sort of in the middle, and the Philippines
a little bit lagging,” Chua said.In a report, London-based Capital Economics said that while “a vaccine should eventually prove a game-changer for the economy,” the Philippines has so far “only secured a small number of doses and faces many logistical challenges to achieving widespread vaccination.”
For Chua, a revert to pre-pandemic gross domestic product (GDP) levels “may take longer” in the Philippines or up to 2022 even as other Asian countries, which also suffered from huge numbers of infections like India and Indonesia, could bounce back sooner.
Chua said it did not help that the Philippines has been under prolonged quarantine such that mobility restrictions badly hit the services sector and its workers—among the bigger contributors to the domestic economy
Chua was also worried that the Philippines’ private-sector investment boom pre-pandemic might not return as fast as it could post-pandemic.
“Even though the fiscal balance sheet is very strong so the government can come in to provide some support and that could help drive the infrastructure, I worry that the lag, the overhang on private-sector capex is going to take a lot longer to unwind going into post-rebound” from the pandemic-induced recession, Chua said.According to Capital Economics, “the economic scars from the downturn, including business insolvencies, weaker household balance sheets and high unemployment, will weigh heavily on demand” this year such that consumer spending, which accounted for about 70 percent of the Philippines’ GDP, was “set to remain in the doldrums.”
“While new infections are past their peak, they remain high and social distancing is likely to remain a drag on the economy throughout 2021,” Capital Economics said.
For Capital Economics, the Philippines’ “failure to contain the virus and lackluster fiscal support means it will experience one of the slowest recoveries” in the Asia-Pacific region.
“The economy has been slow to rebound so far. We estimate the GDP is still 8-percent below its pre-crisis level and even by the end of 2022 output is still likely to be 7.5-percent below the level it would have been had the crisis not happened,” Capital Economics added. INQ

https://globalnation.inquirer.net/194031/fwd-exchanging-filipino-nurses-for-covid-19-vaccines-not-a-good-recommendation-says-solon,Solon: Exchanging Filipino nurses for Covid vaccines ‘not a good recommendation’,Neil Arwin Mercado,"12:14 PM February 24, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Labor and Employment’s (DOLE) offer to deploy more Filipino nurses and other health care workers to the United Kingdom and Germany in exchange for Covid-19 vaccines is “not a good recommendation,” Quezon 4th District Rep. Helen Tan said Wednesday.
Tan, who chairs the House committee on health, opposed DOLE’s offer as she underscored the need for healthcare workers in the Philippines.“No, I hope DOLE is aware that we are in great need of more health care workers [especially] nurses in the different levels of health care facilities. This will mean widening the gaps on health care services,” Tan said in a text message when asked about the offer.
“Although we cannot prevent nurses from leaving the country [because] of better opportunities abroad, still the idea of exchanging them to Covid vaccines is not a good recommendation,” she added.
Tan said the government “can find other ways to have access to Covid vaccines.”
Meanwhile, Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite said the offer to trade Filipino nurses for vaccines “exposes further the utter desperation of the Duterte government in procuring vaccines.”
“It’s a shame that we’ve reached this point that we are ‘commodifying’ our nurses just to get our supply of vaccines. Mga nurse natin ngayon ang magiging kabayaran sa kapalpakan ng pamahalaang ito,” Gaite said in a statement.
Gaite said the nurses are “being held hostage so they can be used as a bargaining chip.”
“Instead of seeing them like trading goods, let’s treat them as workers with dignity and heed their demands for regular jobs, appropriate compensation, and safe working conditions,” Gaite said.
Gabriela Partylist Rep. Arlene Brosas, meanwhile, said the offer was a “desperate attempt to patch up its incompetence in securing vaccines for the Filipino people, including overseas Filipino workers.”
“We should not even have to negotiate this way in the bid to acquire COVID-19 vaccines. Bakit kailangang i-barter ang mas malaking nurse deployment para sa bakuna sa ating mga OFWs?” Brosas said.(Why do we have to barter for more nurse deployment for the vaccines of our OFWs?)
DOLE earlier requested the UK and Germany to provide the Philippines with Covid-19 vaccines in exchange for exemption from the 5,000 per year limit on deployment of Filipino nurses and other health care workers.
International Labor Affairs Bureau Director Alice Visperas said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III has spoken with the UK ambassador to the Philippines regarding the deal.
Visperas said that if the UK and Germany would grant the request of DOLE, the vaccines would go to OFWs who were already repatriated and those who are departing for jobs abroad.

National and local governments recently released details of their respective Covid-19 vaccine acquisition projects that may come into fruition possibly within the first quarter of this year.International pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies such as UK’s AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac Biotech, and Covovax which is developed by US biotechnology company Novavax, have already sealed deals with the national government and local government units (LGUs).
Negotiations for vaccines developed by US-based pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Moderna, China’s Sinopharm, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute were still ongoing.
What appears to be clear for now, based on the pronouncements of National Task Force (NTF) against Covid-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. and presidential spokesman Harry Roque, is that Sinovac’s vaccine will start arriving by February and it would be the only option for Filipinos until June.

AstraZeneca
Over 30 provinces and cities have already set aside funds to buy Covid-19 vaccines. The cities of Makati, Quezon, and Taguig in Metro Manila have announced earmarking P1 billion each for the procurement. And all pledged to offer the vaccines to priority constituents for free.

Most have likewise announced signing deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.

Specifically, some LGUs allocated funds to procure the following number of doses from AstraZeneca:
NCRMakati City – 1,000,000 doses
Manila -City 800,000 doses
Quezon City – 750,000 doses
Valenzuela City – 640,000 doses
Caloocan City – 600,000 doses
Pasig City – 400,000 doses
Las Piñas City – 300,000 doses
Pasay City – 275,000 doses
Parañaque City – 200,000 doses
Muntinlupa City – 100,000 doses
Navotas City – 100,000 doses
LUZON
Dagupan City – 160,000 doses
Ilocos Norte – 120,000 doses

Ormoc City – 270,000 doses
MINDANAO
Zamboanga City – 400,000 doses
Oroquieta City – 120,000 doses
Other LGUs like Mandaluyong City, San Juan City, Taguig City, Baguio City, Bacolod City, and Davao City did not disclose the number of doses they have secured from AstraZeneca due to the nondisclosure agreement they signed with the company.
Private sector firms have also secured deals with the UK-based vaccine manufacturer via a tripartite arrangement with the national government.
First off is the agreement signed between 30 private companies, the Philippine government, and AstraZeneca for 2.6 million vaccine doses – half of which would be for its regular and contractual employees while the other half would be given to government medical front-liners.
Second is the deal between over 200 companies, the national government, and AstraZeneca for 3 million doses– half of which for its workers while the other would be donated to the national government.
Covovax
On Sunday, Galvez said the government has signed an agreement with Serum Institute of India (SII) for the supply of 30 million doses of Covovax vaccine.
He added that the number of doses is still extendible to 40 million.

Sinovac
Roque on Monday said the national government has secured from Sinovac 25 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine.
Roque also said the first batch of Sinovac vaccine or some 50,000 doses could arrive in the country by next month.
COVAX Facility
Galvez likewise detailed that there will be 40 million Covid-19 vaccine doses from the COVAX Facility, which the government eyes to administer to 22 million Filipinos.
In December 2020, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire announced that the COVAX Facility has guaranteed Covid-19 vaccine for 20 percent of the country’s population.
The COVAX Facility, also known as the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Acces Facility, is a global mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines worldwide.
It is co-led by Gavi, an international organization created to improve access to new and underused vaccines, along with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization.
The Philippines joined the COVAX Facility in July.
Additional 60 million doses
During the hearing of the Senate Committee of the Whole on January 11, Galvez disclosed a “potential” signing this week for the procurement of additional 60 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines.
“[W]e cannot disclose all the other, but we are potentially signing the term sheet of more or less another than 60 million within the week,” Galvez said.

Pfizer, Moderna, Gamaleya
As for other drug manufacturers’ vaccines, government officials said negotiations continue.
Galvez said he could not disclose yet how many doses the government is planning to procure from Pfizer but assured it’s a “very sizable amount.”
He also cited 25 million doses of Russia’s Gamaleya or Sputnik V vaccine that the government expects to obtain.
“We are still negotiating with Moderna, they are allocating us more or less 15 to 20 million dosages. The private sector under Enrique Razon already committed to help us in bringing Moderna to the Philippines,” the vaccine czar said.
“So the private sector is helping out so we can immediately lock in on the negotiation,” he added.

“We have money, but it’s in the bank. The problem is that rich countries bought all the supplies. There’s a scramble [for vaccines] now,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino.According to him, procurement laws have not made it easy for the country to get vaccines, as the government could not“play” with public funds.
But he said that Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the chief implementor of the government’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, had already talked with the Chinese firm — that is Sinovac Biotech — from which the government would buy vaccines.
In September, Duterte slammed pharmaceutical companies, particularly those in Western countries, for asking for advance payment for COVID-19 vaccines still under development.
In November, he changed his mind, allowing concerned government agencies to enter into advance market commitments with private vaccine developers and make advance payments.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1398130/dost-appeals-for-more-vaccine-trial-volunteers,DOST appeals for more COVID-19 vaccine trial volunteers,Leila B. Salaverria,"05:18 AM February 21, 2021","The government is calling on Filipinos to take part in clinical trials, especially one that is already ongoing and two others that are set to start soon, as a way of helping produce an effective vaccine for COVID-19.
Janssen Pharmaceuticals, which is based in Belgium and owned by Johnson & Johnson, has started its clinical trial in the Philippines for its single-shot vaccine.Two Chinese companies, Sinovac Biotech and Clover Biopharmaceutical, are in the final stages of preparations for their trials in the country.
“We encourage our countrymen to join clinical trials if your barangay is chosen as one of the sites of the clinical trial, because we need to find a vaccine that is effective and safe and efficacious,” said Undersecretary Rowena Guevara of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
At the moment, Janssen is recruiting and screening participants, said Guevara.
Those who would pass the screening would be given the vaccines and their condition would be monitored, she said.
Adverse effects
In case of adverse effects in independent clinical trials, the vaccine developers would shoulder the cost of treatment, she said.
In the case of the World Health Organization (WHO) solidarity trial, the WHO would provide global insurance to the volunteers.
The Philippine government would not shoulder any of the costs, Guevara added.
The DOST earlier said Janssen would likely conduct trials in the cities of San Pablo and Cabuyao in Laguna province, La Paz in Iloilo province, and Metro Manila.
Johnson & Johnson said Janssen’s vaccine was found to be 72-percent effective in its United States trials.The company also said the vaccine was “85-percent effective overall in preventing severe disease and demonstrated complete protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death as of Day 28.”
Janssen’s vaccine is a single shot unlike the vaccines produced by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which require two jabs to be fully effective.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on Saturday said the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines was due to their requirement of a government assurance that they would not be hailed to court in the same way that Sanofi Pasteur was following the Dengvaxia fiasco.
Indemnification fund
“All of us are getting impatient. But the manufacturers, Pfizer, Astrazeneca, became afraid and want to have assurance that what happened to Dengvaxia would not happen to them, when the manufacturer of that vaccine was sued,” Roque said during his appearance at a television noontime show.
Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. on Thursday said that it already had an indemnification agreement with AstraZeneca.
“For the information of everyone, in our initial negotiations, Pfizer wasn’t asking for that, just only now, that’s why we were a bit surprised because the only one that insisted on what we call indemnity clause was Johnson & Johnson,” Galvez said.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Saturday said the passage of a law creating an indemnification fund would speed up negotiations for COVID-19 vaccines.
Vergeire said the indemnification agreement with vaccine manufacturers was the main challenge for the country at the moment.
Urgent measure
President Duterte certified as urgent the measure to create an indemnity fund to help those who would experience adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccines.
Speaker Lord Allan Velasco has committed passage on Monday of his House Bill No. 8648, which provides, among others, an indemnification fund.
Vergeire explained that all drug manufacturers required an indemnification agreement because the vaccines were still under development, and they would not want any liability for their emergency use.
Other countries already have existing laws for indemnification, she noted.
“The reason we are having more difficulty in negotiation is because we do not have a law to support this indemnification agreement. This is why we are urging Congress to approve this law so that the negotiations would move more quickly,” Vergeire said at Saturday’s Laging Handa briefing.
Informed consent
But while the law is not yet in place, she said the Philippines negotiated with vaccine manufacturers to come up with specific documents to address their concerns, such as the informed consent form that would include the liability waiver statement.
“We are ensuring [to] them that no liability will be charged against them in case there would be adverse events,” she added.
Once the indemnification agreement has been ironed out, and especially if the indemnification fund law has been passed, negotiations with vaccine manufacturers and with the COVAX facility would move swiftly, Vergeire said.
“And that would facilitate the arrival of the vaccines into the country,” she added.
Vergeire also said the Dengvaxia issue was “beside the point.”

“That’s why there are negotiations with the British government, China, India, and also with Russia that, if possible, they could deliver more during the first quarter,” Galvez said in Filipino.
“And we’re negotiating that, even if it becomes a bit more expensive, just as long as there’s early delivery in the second quarter and in the first quarter,” he added.
Galvez did not identify the vaccine manufacturers.
Due to the shortage of supplies for the first and second quarter of the year, Galvez said the main rollout for the Covid-19 vaccines would be in the third and fourth quarter.
The Philippines will receive 161 million doses of Covid-19 shots by the end of 2021, Galvez noted.
The government plans to start Covid-19 vaccinations as soon as the Sinovac vaccines – of which 600,000 doses were donated by the Chinese government — arrive.

But previously, the government already announced having secured vaccines from China’s Sinovac, British drugmaker AstraZeneca, U.S. companies Pfizer and Moderna, and the Serum Institute of India.
“All in all, by this February, second week, we’re trying to come up with the supply agreements with the vaccine manufacturers and we will also include the two remaining contracts we are negotiating,” said Galvez.
“We are expecting up to 146 to 148 million doses. This is excluding the COVAX [facility where] we are assured to have more or less 40 million doses,” he added.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1399844/only-19-of-adult-pinoys-ok-with-getting-covid-19-vaccines-46-not-willing,46% of adult Filipinos unwilling to get COVID-19 vaccine; only 19% willing,Gabriel Pabico Lalu,"12:58 AM February 25, 2021","MANILA, Philippines —Only 19 percent of adult Filipinos are willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 46 percent are unwilling even if a safe and effective vaccine is available.
This is the finding of a survey done by OCTA Research, a group of top academicians studying the coronavirus pandemic.According to the survey, the intent to get vaccines is lowest among respondents in Balance Luzon, which is at 14 percent, followed by the Visayas at 20 percent, Metro Manila at 25 percent, and Mindanao at 26 percent.
Meanwhile, the number of those who would reject COVID-19 vaccination is highest in Balance Luzon and the Visayas at 47 percent, followed by Mindanao and Metro Manila at 43 percent each.
Roughly a third, or 35 percent, were undecided if they would get vaccinated. Most of these were in Balance Luzon at 39 percent, followed by Metro Manila at 31 percent, the Visayas at 33 percent, and Mindanao at 32 percent.
The top reason for not getting the vaccine, given by 73 percent of respondents, was a concern for the safety of the vaccines, followed by doubt about their efficacy.
Concern for vaccine safety was higher in Mindanao at 78 percent and in Balance Luzon at 76 percent, compared to Metro Manila at 69 percent and in the Visayas at 64 percent.
One alarming figure that the study found out is that 9 percent do not want to get the vaccine because they believe it is not needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.
The two other reasons for not wanting to get vaccinated were “the vaccine is not free,” given by 6 percent of respondents, and “the vaccine is expensive,” given by 6 percent.
The OCTA Research survey shows little variance between various socioeconomic classes’ in their sentiments towards the COVID-19 vaccine. Those willing to get vaccinated are 23 percent in Classes A, B, and C; 18 percent in Class D; and 23 percent in Class E.
Those unwilling to get vaccinated are 45 percent in Classes A, B, and C; 46 percent in Class D; 44 percent in Class E.This is not the first survey on COVID-19 vaccination conducted by OCTA Research. Last January, the group released another study saying that only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents would want to get vaccinated.
Aside from issues with COVID-19 vaccine procurement, the government is always questioned about its efforts to disseminate proper information about vaccines while assuring the public about its safety and efficacy.
In a radio interview last January, Vice President Leni Robredo said that the government must craft an efficient communication plan that would clear up concerns with the COVID-19 vaccines.
While Malacañang rebuked Robredo for her suggestions — saying that these were already being carried out — the Vice President’s camp questioned why surveys done by different polling firms indicated low appreciation for COVID-19 vaccines.

Those unwilling to get vaccinated are 45 percent in Classes A, B, and C; 46 percent in Class D; 44 percent in Class E.This is not the first survey on COVID-19 vaccination conducted by OCTA Research.Last January, the group released another study saying that only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents would want to get vaccinated.In a radio interview last January, Vice President Leni Robredo said that the government must craft an efficient communication plan that would clear up concerns with the COVID-19 vaccines.What you need to know about Coronavirus.",0.0,0.8605999946594238,"get, ph, moderna, case, china, sinovac, filipino, duterte, dose, willing","['adult', 'filipino', 'unwilling', 'get', 'willing']",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.525,Neutral

MANILA, Philippines — The application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) ofAmerican pharmaceutical firm Pfizer in the Philippines may be approved before the end of January, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Thursday. “Since we’re working now, I would say before the end of January,” FDA director-general Eric Domingo said in an interview on ANC’s Headstart when asked for a timetable on the approval of Pfizer’s EUA application.
“The evaluation is going to take about two weeks, so it was given to us right before Christmas. So I’m giving the evaluators up to the first week of January and of course, I have to consolidate the report,” he added.Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo. (Consuelo Marquez / INQUIRER.net)“An EUA is not a one-letter certificate. It’s going to be a big document that will specify all of the conditions for authorization.”Pfizer submitted its application for EUA in the Philippines last Dec. 23, Malacañang previously announced.The EUA is seen to shorten the FDA’s process of approving COVID-19 vaccines from six months to just 21 days. The FDA’s issuance of an EUA also means that the agency recognizes the vaccines’ approval by regulatory bodies overseas.Pfizer has already secured an EUA from the United States’ FDA. gsg

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. signed the term sheet on behalf of the government. The vaccines will be available starting the third quarter of 2021.SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has partnered with Novavax, a U.S.-based biotechnology company for the development and commercialization of its Covovax vaccine.
Covovax is in third-stage trials and expected to be approved for use by international regulators.
“The vaccine will be used to vaccinate 15 million vulnerable and poor Filipinos. The vaccine is stable at 2°C to 8°C, the standard temperature that is within the existing cold chain system in the Philippines, thus allowing its distribution to the remotest barangays,” said Dr. Luningning Villa, medical director of Faberco Life Sciences Inc., SII’s Philippine partner.
The price of the vaccine is expected to be finalized soon between the government and SII.
So far, the Philippines has secured 2.6 million doses of vaccine from British drugmaker AstraZeneca through a tripartite agreement with local private firms. The vaccines are expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021.
The government is also in talks with other drugmakers such as Pfizer and Moderna of the United States, Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm of China, and the Gamaleya Institute of Russia.

https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1385907/duterte-will-get-vaccine-shot-in-private,Duterte will get COVID-19 vaccine shot in private,Leila B. Salaverria,"04:53 AM January 20, 2021","MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte will be given the COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes available in the Philippines, but he will be vaccinated behind closed doors, Malacañang said on Tuesday.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the public would be informed if the vaccine had been administered to Mr. Duterte.Roque was answering a question about the President’s willingness to take the first shot of CoronaVac, the COVID-19 vaccine made by the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech.
‘No problem’
He said he had talked to Mr. Duterte about the question and the President had responded, “No problem, I will take the vaccine as soon as it is available.”
The President knows he has to be inoculated against COVID-19, Roque said.
“But he said it does not have to be shown to the public. He is taking the route of the British sovereign because the decision of Queen Elizabeth and her husband was to make their vaccination private,” he added.
Mr. Duterte has expressed his preference for CoronaVac or Sputnik V, the vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute of Russia.
The Philippines is expected to receive next month the first 50,000 doses of the 25 million doses of CoronaVac it is planning to buy.
Also expected next month is the first batch of the vaccine made by the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer. The Pfizer vaccine is the first to be granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
China is also donating 500,000 doses of CoronaVac to the Philippines, with Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian vouching on Tuesday for its safety and promoting it as “very suitable” for tropical countries.
Emergency use permit
The Department of Health (DOH), however, said any donated vaccine could not be used in the country without being granted emergency use authorization by the FDA.Sinovac has applied for emergency permit for CoronaVac with the FDA, but the regulator has found the company’s papers incomplete.
The government aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of the country’s population, this year.
The Philippines has one of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in Asia.
On Tuesday, the DOH reported 1,357 additional coronavirus infections, raising the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country to 504,804.
The DOH said 324 more patients had recovered, bringing the total number of COVID-19 survivors to 466,249. But the death toll rose to 9,978 with the deaths of 69 more patients.
The deaths and recoveries left the country with 27,857 active cases, of which 86.1 percent were mild, 6.1 percent asymptomatic, 0.42 percent moderate, 2.7 percent severe, and 4.7 percent critical.
