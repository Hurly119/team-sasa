https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/explainers/why-covid-19-vaccines-not-arrive-philippines,Here’s why COVID-19 vaccines haven’t arrived in the Philippines yet,SOFIA TOMACRUZ,2021-02-18 09:22:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
The Philippine government needs a key measure on indemnification funds to be signed into law
Philippine pandemic officials announced the delivery of the country’s first batch of coronavirus vaccines could be expected by mid-February. But with that timeline looking less likely to be met, the Duterte government’s task force officials announced there would be a slight delay in the arrival of vaccines due to, of all things, paperwork.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr and National Task Force COVID-19 Deputy Chief Implementer Vince Dizon pointed to documentary requirements involving an indemnification fund as the culprit behind the delayed schedule.
Why do we need an indemnification fund?
An indemnification fund, Galvez earlier told lawmakers during congressional hearings, was necessary for the Philippines to gain access to vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies as well as the COVAX global facility.
He requested lawmakers to consider bills that would provide for such in mid-January, adding it could give the Philippines an opportunity to gain access to larger supplies of vaccines and increase public confidence in the government’s rollout.The reason why indemnification funds or programs are required of countries is because vaccines being used worldwide are still under emergency use authorization (EUA), with only limited short-term data available on the full effects that could arise from receiving a shot.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities like COVAX, along with vaccine manufacturers, will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events. This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting vaccines emergency use approval.“You’ll have an indemnification program because there is no full data yet. So if an unexpected adverse event happens, any company cannot be sued because you enter an agreement with the company where you are guaranteeing them that you will take responsibility for any adverse event because you’re aware the data is not complete yet – but you’re allowing its use because there is a national emergency,” said Dr Aileen Espina, a public health and family medicine specialist and member of the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC).
“That’s why we’re particular that for any vaccine that will be used, the benefits outweigh the risks,” she added.
But vaccines aren't here yet. What else should the government do?
On Monday night, February 15, Galvez said that task force for vaccine procurement officials have done their part in submitting requirements needed to facilitate Filipinos’ access to vaccines. This is on top of efforts by the Department of Health.
Specifically, government lawyers have finished fine-tuning details of an indemnification clause with COVAX and are now waiting on the facility, the World Health Organization (WHO), and Pfizer to finalize it. (Among the vaccines expected to arrive in the Philippines in the first quarter of 2021 are those developed by Pfizer, BioNTech, and AstraZeneca.)
On Wednesday, February 17, Galvez said that the Philippine government has already signed onto the agreements.
The vaccine czar said it was now waiting on Congress and the WHO to ensure the availability of an indemnification fund and concur with the Philippines’ proposed indemnification program, respectively.“Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO (The ball is with Congress and the WHO),” Galvez said.
While requirements for vaccines coming from COVAX are steps away from being finalized, lawmakers in Congress will still need to pass measures creating an indemnification program to facilitate access to vaccines purchased through agreements between the Philippines and vaccine manufacturers.
Why are we talking about indemnification only now if it's important?
The government was informed of the indemnification requirement only during the latter phase of vaccine negotiations.
Senator Sonny Angara said on Wednesday, February 17, that this issue was not even raised during the 2021 budget deliberations, ""otherwise, [Congress] would have put a fund on that.""
Galvez first informed the Senate about the need for legislation on the indemnification program during committee of the whole hearings in January. It was only on February 11 that the urgency of this measure was tackled in depth during a public hearing.
Nandoon po sa Congress ang ball at saka po nandoon po sa WHO.
SECRETARY CARLITO GALVEZ JR
Why do we need a law? Won't this further delay vaccine arrival?
A law is needed to be able to tap into the Contingent Fund, as this expense was not covered under the GAA, Budget Secretary Wendel Avisado told Rappler.
National Task Force COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon said a law is also being required by vaccine manufacturers, aside from the COVAX facility, to hold them free from any liabilities for severe adverse effects arising from immunization.
COVAX officials earlier listed this as part of requirements for all countries participating in the global scheme to ensure equitable access to vaccines, saying vaccine manufacturers were reluctant to guarantee supplies if they were not indemnified against possible liability.“Given the unprecedented speed and scope of deployment of recently licensed vaccines, manufacturers have highlighted the risks of unforeseen claims due to injury associated with the vaccine. Manufacturers are reluctant to deliver COVID-19 vaccines if this risk is not addressed,” COVAX said.For countries like the Philippines that will receive donated vaccines from the facility, COVAX said a model indemnification agreement will already be incorporated in agreements with manufacturers to decrease time spent for negotiations.
Where will the government source indemnity payments?
Since there was no allocation in the P4.5-trillion 2021 budget, the Philippine government and Congress have to look where they could source this.
During a February 11 Senate hearing, two options were considered:
For the indemnity payments to be included under PhilHealth's coverage using its funds
Tapping into the P13-billion Contingent Fund in the national budget, which would require a law
During that hearing, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that PhilHealth did not include this in its corporate budget this year, but that the state health insurer will ""study"" the possibility of tapping into its P116-billion reserve funds.
The result of the February 11 hearing is Senate Bill (SB) 2057, which is currently being tackled at the upper chamber's plenary. The bill is proposing the creation of a P500-million indemnification fund to be sourced from the Contingent Fund. This will cover compensation in case of death and medical treatment for vaccine recipients experiencing severe adverse effects.
In the House of Representatives, lawmakers have also filed a counterpart measure through House Bill No. (HB) 8648, which seeks to exempt local government units from bidding requirements under the procurement law, grant tax exemptions for vaccines, and create an indemnification fund for the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.So far, HB 8648 does not include an immunity clause, nor an amount that will be allocated for the indemnification fund.
Who will implement the indemnification program?
According to Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri, while funds will be administered by PhilHealth, the DOH will be in charge of implementing the indemnification program where adverse events linked to a vaccine may be determined.
This means that if someone were to experience a serious adverse reaction, the DOH, through its post-monitoring of vaccinations, will determine if an adverse effect is indeed linked to the vaccine. If so, PhilHealth would cover the cost of care, with funds sourced from the indemnity fund.

What's the status of pending bills in Congress?
Both Senate and House bills were already sponsored at the plenary. At the upper chamber, interpellations will resume on Monday, February 22, before the Senate version of the indemnification bill is scheduled to be passed on 2nd reading.At the House, amendments to HB 8648 were finalized on Wednesday. It is also up for 2nd reading.
At their current pace, the bills could be passed on final reading during the last week of February or during the first week of March due to the 3-day interval rule between the 2nd and 3rd reading. Since the current versions of the Senate and House bills are different, there's also a chance of a bicameral conference committee (bicam).
If President Rodrigo Duterte certifies the vaccine bill as urgent – as requested by Galvez – Congress can do away with the 3-day interval rule.If the President issues the certification in the last week of February, then there’s a chance that both chambers will also be able to pass the bills on final reading that same week. To further hasten the process, the Senate or the House may need to adopt the other chamber's version, so that a bicam won't be needed. The bill will then be up for signature by the President for it to become law.
Once a law is passed, will we get our vaccine supply immediately?
This will still depend on when the government will sign supply agreements with vaccine firms, as well as the capacity of vaccine manufacturers to deliver doses to all countries that have locked in orders.As it stands, Galvez said only term sheets have been signed with vaccine manufacturers as of mid-February. Term sheets are the second to the last step in vaccine negotiations required to lock in logistics needed for production and delivery.For the last step, a supply agreement will still need to be signed with these companies to facilitate actual purchase and payment, as well as set a definite date for delivery.
Galvez earlier said that current limited global supply has prevented vaccine manufacturers from entering binding supply agreements with the government. – with reports from Mara

https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/timeline-philippines-2021-covid-19-vaccination-plan,TIMELINE: The Philippines’ 2021 COVID-19 vaccine plan,SOFIA TOMACRUZ,2021-02-04 19:43:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
(UPDATED) On March 1, the Philippines finally begins to legally roll out COVID-19 vaccines, with the first doses from Sinovac
For nearly a year, President Rodrigo Duterte used speech after speech to claim that salvation from the pandemic would come from one thing only: vaccines. Now, the Philippines is just weeks away from starting an immunization campaign that aims to deliver exactly that.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr outlined the ambitious targets the government had for its vaccine program: secure at least 148 million vaccine doses and inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos within 2021 – just enough to reach the recommended 60% of the population scientists estimated was needed to reach herd immunity against COVID-19.In reaching these goals, Galvez, along with other pandemic and health officials face challenges that have stumped even the wealthiest of countries when distributing vaccines to the public.With the distribution of the country’s first vaccine doses slated for February, the Duterte government’s timeline for its vaccine plan in 2021 hinges on many things – including delivery, storage, local government plans, and drawing up of masterlists – going right.Where things stand now
On Monday, March 1, the Philippines officially began rolling out COVID-19 vaccine doses.At 9:40 am, the first COVID-19 vaccine in the country was legally administered by nurse Sherlock Cruz to Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the few coronavirus-designated hospitals in the country.
Along with Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, government medical adviser Dr Edsel Salvana, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, and deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon were also vaccinated.
To secure vaccines, the Philippine government has been in talks with at least 7 companies, including Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax, Sinovac, Gamaleya, and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica).Galvez said of the 7 companies, there were 5 with whom term sheets have been signed.Term sheets are the second to the last document that needs to be signed. It sees companies commit to supplying doses for Filipinos.Actual delivery and use will depend on details agreed upon in supply deals and whether the vaccine is granted emergency use authorization from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration.As the main person in charge of vaccine negotiations for the Philippines, Galvez said supply deals were scheduled to be signed by the end of February. All contracts for vaccines were expected to be finalized by mid-February, he added.In terms of preparations for the actual deployment of vaccines on the ground, various local government units (LGUs) have been running simulation exercises to rehearse their plans for storing, transporting, and distributing vaccines in their communities.The Department of Health, along with task force officials, approved the vaccines plans of several LGUs in Metro Manila, with more expected to be cleared in the coming weeks.SCREENSHOT FROM NATIONAL TASK FORCE COVID-19
1ST QUARTER: 'Mini rollout'
The first 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine donated by the Chinese government arrived in the Philippines on February 28.Sinovac was the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, following Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Sinovac’s vaccine was the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility, which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February. This included 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine and 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine earlier expected to arrive courtesy of the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization (WHO).
COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila – the epicenter of the pandemic in the country – will be prioritized for the initial vaccine supplies. The following hospitals were listed:Philippine General Hospital
Lung CenterDr Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala)
Veterans Memorial Medical Center
Philippine National Police General Hospital
Victoriano Luna Medical CenterOther vaccines like AstraZeneca which were expected to arrive in the first quarter will likewise be prioritized for frontline health workers caring for patients in high-risk areas or places where infections rates were still high. (The Philippines expected to receive at least 5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine from COVAX.)Galvez said this phase of the government’s vaccine plan will be considered a “mini rollout” as it will cover some 1.7 million healthcare workers, along with other government frontliners who will be responsible for mounting the vaccine rollout in the coming months.2nd QUARTER: Vulnerable sectors, 'economic frontliners'
By this time, the government expects 10 to 15 million doses of vaccines to arrive in the country, on top of more vaccines to be supplied by COVAX.WHO Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasignhe said the country is potentially looking at receiving a maximum of 9.2 million doses by March or April, while the remainder of the 44 million doses it was entitled to through COVAX will come at the end of the year.The 9.2 million doses will be AstraZeneca’s vaccine manufactured in South Korea, though the actual amount will depend on manufacturing capacity, Abeyasinghe said.Galvez said these vaccines will be used to inoculate members of vulnerable sector such as senior citizens and indigent Filipinos. The government is also eyeing to start the vaccination of “economic frontliners.”During these months, supplies of AstraZeneca’s vaccine ordered by the private sector and local government units are also expected to start arriving in the country.MUST READ

3rd QUARTER: 'Massive rollout' begins
At this point, we should expect the Duterte government’s vaccine rollout to be in full swing as bulk of vaccines purchased should start arriving in the Philippines.The number of doses to be made available in these months was somewhere between 30 million to 50 million, Galvez said. The amount would be enough to start inoculating about 25 million Filipinos.Based on negotiations, some of the vaccines that may be delivered during these months include those developed by US pharmaceutical firms Moderna and Novavax.Galvez earlier signed a term sheet securing at least 30 million doses of Novavax vaccine to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, while Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said Moderna was among companies willing to supply doses to the Philippines by mid-2021.4th QUARTER: Targets reached?
In the latter months of the year, what Galvez described as the “full rollout” of vaccines will continue as bulk of vaccines procured through negotiations will be delivered.These months will be crucial if the Duterte government is to reach its goal of inoculating 50 million to 70 million Filipinos. Galvez spelled out the stakes in the campaign, saying the country needed to reach this number if it is to achieve herd immunity and jumpstart economic recovery. – Rappler.com

(UPDATED) Malacañang says 487,200 doses from the COVAX global facility will be handed over to the government
The Philippines will receive its first shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines on Thursday, March 4, days after logistical concerns and supply problems delayed the delivery of doses originally scheduled for March 1.“This is to confirm that the initial shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines is set to arrive tomorrow,” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said on Tuesday, March 3.
Roque said 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine would be handed over to the Philippines on Thursday at 7:30 pm. The latest number of doses to arrive is lower than the 525,600 doses the Philippines had expected to receive on March 1.
Roque did not say why the number of AstraZeneca doses to be delivered on March 4 was lower.
Roque earlier said that President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to witness the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines supplied by the COVAX facility led by the World Health Organization.Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr thanked countries including Germany, the Republic of Korea, and European Union for donating to the COVAX facility, saying the Philippines was ""deeply grateful"" for their contribution.
Why this matters
The latest batch of vaccines from the COVAX facility will allow at least 243,00 more health workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19. A considerable number had turned down Sinovac's vaccine, opting to wait for AstraZeneca’s vaccine to be delivered to the country.
The Philippines earlier received 600,000 Sinovac doses donated by China on February 28, though enthusiasm for the vaccine was muted amid concerns over its lower efficacy and the robustness of its data compared to other vaccines. (READ: Philippines begins legally rolling out first COVID-19 vaccines)

(UPDATED) Its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine, after a review of late-stage trial data reaffirmed the shot was safe and effective.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo made the announcement in a virtual press briefing on on Monday, February 22, just a day before Duterte government officials said Sinovac’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines.“After a thorough and rigorous review of the currently available published and unpublished data by our regulatory and medical experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac Life Science Company,” Domingo said.Sinovac is now the third company to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines. Its approval follows that of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s, and may speed up the start of the country’s inoculation campaign set back by delays in paperwork and limited global supply.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Monday that the Chinese embassy in Manila advised Philippine officials it would need 3 to 5 days to prepare for the delivery of vaccines once emergency use for it was issued in the Philippines.Aside from the Philippines, China, Indonesia, Turkey and Brazil have granted emergency authorization for the Chinese vaccine.Not for use among health workers
While the FDA granted Sinovac’s vaccine emergency approval, Domingo said the FDA’s regulatory and medical experts cited conditions and recommendations for its use in the country.Foremost among these was that experts did not recommend its use among health workers, as the group has high exposure to COVID-19.A review of published and unpublished data on the vaccine from ongoing Phase 3 trials showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2% among healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old. The findings, coming from community trials in Indonesia and Turkey, means the vaccine is a viable option for this group.But its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
“The safety profile is good, adverse events were mild to moderate, and possibility of allergy or anaphylaxis is minimal,” Domingo said in Filipino. “When the vaccines arrive in the country, this can be usedin groups where safety and efficacy is proven – 18 to 59 year old clinically healthy individuals.”
Under scrutiny
The emergency approval of Sinovac’s vaccines comes after Philippine lawmakers in the Senate scrutinized the Duterte government’s seeming preference for the Chinese vaccine despite reportedly higher prices and lower efficacy findings compared to other vaccine options.
Before the EUA was issued, health experts held off on judging the vaccine due to limited publicly available data on late-stage trials. Despite this, some of the government’s expert advisers sought to quell concerns over the country’s decision to consider the vaccine, saying its findings on preventing severe COVID-19 infections and death can contribute toward the government's goal of taming the pandemic.
The use of Sinovac in the Philippines is among the few that will be done from the government’s direct purchase of vaccines. Duque said some 600,000 doses may be delivered before the end of the month.
Domingo stressed that while the FDA granted Sinovac an EUA, it is not full approval. Securing full marketing authority – which is necessary to commercialize and sell the vaccine – would be contingent on Sinovac’s commitment to finish development of the product. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.5327000021934509,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['update', 'low', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'lead', 'expert', 'recommend', 'use', 'priority', 'sector', 'brazil', 'trial', 'involve', 'health', 'worker', 'expose', 'food', 'use_authorization', 'sinovac', 'review', 'late_stage', 'trial', 'datum', 'reaffirm', 'shoot', 'safe', 'effective', 'fda', 'make', 'announcement', 'briefing', 'february', 'day', 'duterte', 'government', 'official', 'say', 'vaccine', 'suppose', 'arrive', 'thorough', 'rigorous', 'review', 'currently', 'available', 'publish', 'unpublished', 'datum', 'regulatory', 'medical', 'expert', 'fda', 'grant', 'authorization', 'sinovac', 'life', 'science', 'company', 'domingo', 'say', 'sinovac', 'third', 'company', 'approval', 'approval', 'follow', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'speed', 'start', 'country', 'inoculation', 'campaign', 'set', 'delay', 'paperwork', 'limit', 'global', 'supply', 'health', 'say', 'monday', 'chinese', 'embassy', 'advise', 'official', 'need', 'day', 'prepare', 'delivery', 'vaccine', 'issue', 'aside', 'china', 'indonesia', 'turkey', 'granted_emergency', 'authorization', 'chinese', 'use', 'health', 'worker', 'grant', 'sinovac', 'emergency', 'approval', 'domingo', 'say', 'fda', 'regulatory', 'medical', 'expert', 'cite', 'condition', 'recommendation', 'use', 'country', 'foremost', 'expert', 'recommend', 'use', 'health', 'worker', 'group', 'high', 'exposure', 'review', 'publish', 'unpublished', 'datum', 'ongoing', 'phase', 'trial', 'show', 'efficacy', 'healthy_individual', 'aged_year', 'old', 'finding', 'come', 'community', 'trial', 'indonesia', 'turkey', 'mean', 'viable', 'option', 'group', 'low', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'lead', 'expert', 'recommend', 'use', 'priority', 'sector', 'brazil', 'trial', 'involve', 'health', 'worker', 'expose', 'safety', 'profile', 'good', 'adverse_event', 'mild', 'moderate', 'possibility', 'allergy', 'minimal', 'domingo', 'say', 'filipino', 'vaccine', 'arrive', 'country', 'usedin', 'group', 'safety', 'efficacy', 'prove', 'year', 'old', 'clinically', 'healthy_individual', 'scrutiny', 'emergency', 'approval', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'come', 'lawmaker', 'scrutinize', 'duterte', 'government', 'seem', 'preference', 'chinese', 'reportedly', 'high', 'price', 'low', 'efficacy', 'finding', 'compare', 'option', 'issue', 'health', 'expert', 'hold', 'judging', 'due', 'limit', 'publicly', 'available', 'data', 'late_stage', 'trial', 'government', 'expert', 'adviser', 'seek', 'quell', 'concern', 'country', 'decision', 'consider', 'say', 'finding', 'prevent', 'severe', 'infection', 'death', 'contribute', 'government', 'goal', 'tame', 'pandemic', 'use', 'sinovac', 'do', 'government', 'direct', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'duque', 'say', 'dose', 'deliver', 'end', 'month', 'stress', 'fda', 'grant', 'sinovac', 'eua', 'full', 'approval', 'secure', 'full', 'marketing', 'authority', 'necessary', 'commercialize', 'sell', 'contingent', 'sinovac', 'commitment', 'finish', 'development', 'product', 'com']",0.9666,0.095,0.743,0.162,0.3825537634408603,Positive

(3rd UPDATE) The arrival of donated COVID-19 vaccines from China paves the way for the start of the Philippines' inoculation campaign, among the last to start in Southeast Asia
The Philippines' first batch of coronavirus vaccines arrived in the country on Sunday, February 28, paving the way for the start of its mass inoculation campaign with shots developed by China's Sinovac Biotech.
The aircraft carrying the vaccines – a transport plane of the People's Liberation Army of China – landed at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City around 4:10 pm on Sunday.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel. That is light at the end of the tunnel,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in an interview with state-run network PTV. ""At least nagsimula na po tayo. At tuluy-tuloy na po."" (At least we have started. And this will continue.)
The delivery of 600,000 doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac – a donation from the Chinese government – was set to be witnessed by President Rodrigo Duterte, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr at the Villamor Air Base.
Malacañang earlier hailed the delivery of Sinovac's vaccine, which would be used to jump-start the country's vaccination campaign in several hospitals across Metro Manila.
Though the Duterte government had targeted to start distributing vaccines by February, the Philippines is now among the last countries in Southeast Asia to start vaccinating its residents. It was the last to receive vaccine doses in the region.
The arrival of the vaccine comes days after the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for CoronaVac last Monday, February 22.
Sinovac is the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, though its vaccine is the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February.
China first announced it would donate vaccines to Filipinos during the official visit of Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi to Manila last January.
Senator Bong Go, former presidential aide, said on Sunday that Galvez, Duque, and other Cabinet secretaries will be among the first government officials to be vaccinated with Sinovac on Monday, March 1.
Duterte, 75, will not be receiving Sinovac as the FDA, along with government experts, did not recommend its use for senior citizens or those 60 years old and above. Data from late-stage trials had mostly been gathered from participants 18 to 59 years old.
""To my fellow Filipinos, these vaccines are backed by science and deliberated by our Filipino experts. I encourage that you get vaccinated at the soonest possible time and be a partner in preventing the further spread of the disease,"" Duterte said in a speech.
Health workers go first
Aside from several government officials, health workers were identified as a priority to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
In a press conference later on Sunday, Duterte said health workers who refuse to take Sinovac “have a choice,” and can wait for the other vaccines that are set to arrive in the country.
“Kung ayaw nila ng Sinovac, maghintay sila,” he said. “In a few days, there has been quite a… basta I was assured that [AstraZeneca] would be coming within the next few days.”At least 525,600 doses of vaccines developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is expected to arrive in a week, after it was postponed from March 1.
In issuing Sinovac an EUA, the FDA said data from Phase 3 trials in Brazil, where a lower efficacy of 50.4% was observed, led experts not to recommend its use for priority groups. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The recommendation spurred days-long deliberations among experts part of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, who later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, reiterating it is safe and effective.
With vaccine supply scarce and delivery of different brands uncertain, experts said health workers should be given the chance to receive an available vaccine since they are most exposed to COVID-19. In the meantime, health workers who will refuse to get Sinovac were given assurances they would not lose their place in the government's prioritization.The FDA granted emergency approval to Sinovac after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
Aside from the Philippines, Indonesia, Turkey, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, and Laos have granted emergency authorization for Sinovac's CoronaVac. – with reports from Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com

(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision clears the way for the use of a vaccine expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign
The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for the local use of the vaccine that is expected to boost the country’s immunization campaign.The COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is the second to be given emergency use approval in the Philippines, where health officials are closely monitoring infections after the detection of the more infectious United Kingdom (UK) variant in the country.Its approval comes nearly two weeks after the FDA gave approval to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine which had been the first to apply for emergency authorization in the country.“After a thorough review of the currently available data, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of AstraZeneca ” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA and that the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Strategic vaccine
AstraZeneca and Oxford’s vaccine is poised to become a dominant shot in the country’s COVID-19 vaccine program.
The Philippine government, private sector, and several local governments had earlier entered intro tripartite deals with the drug maker to secure up to 17 million doses of the vaccine for Filipinos. (READ: PH vaccine stockpile from AstraZeneca reaches 17 million doses)
Supplies were expected to arrive sometime in the second quarter of the year, though vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr earlier said that the government was negotiating for an earlier delivery “at the soonest possible time.”
Unlike other vaccines the Philippines eyed to buy, AstraZeneca was among the few companies that have so far expressed willingness to enter into tripartite deals involving local governments and the private sector. Other companies said to be open to the setup are US drug makers Moderna and Novavax.
Health experts earlier said that AstraZeneca’s vaccine would also be easier to distribute inpoorer and harder-to-reach areas, considering it can be transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months, making it compatible with the Department of Health’s (DOH) storage facilities.Early analysis of clinical trial results showed an average efficacy of about 70% after the first dose. The vaccine was seen to be 90% effective in participants who were given a half dose, followed by a full dose. This was compared to 62% efficacy seen in participants who were given two full doses.While the FDA granted AstraZeneca an EUA, it is not yet a full approval.
Securing full marketing authority– which is necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allows its sale in the local market – would be contingent on AstraZeneca’s commitment to finish development of the product. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.8745999932289124,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['update', 'food', 'drug', 'administration', 'decision', 'clear', 'way', 'use', 'expect', 'boost', 'country', 'immunization', 'campaign', 'food', 'fda', 'issue', 'authorization', 'eau', 'astrazeneca', 'clearing', 'way', 'local', 'use', 'expect', 'boost', 'country', 'immunization', 'campaign', 'develop', 'astrazeneca', 'university', 'oxford', 'second', 'give', 'approval', 'health', 'official', 'closely', 'monitor', 'infection', 'detection', 'infectious', 'united_kingdom', 'uk', 'variant', 'country', 'approval', 'come', 'nearly', 'week', 'fda', 'give', 'approval', 'first', 'apply', 'emergency', 'authorization', 'country', 'thorough', 'review', 'currently', 'available', 'datum', 'fda', 'grant', 'authorization', 'astrazeneca', 'fda', 'announce', 'brief', 'domingo', 'say', 'meet', 'condition', 'secure', 'assessment', 'conclude', 'known', 'potential', 'benefit', 'pfizer', 'outweigh', 'known', 'strategic', 'astrazeneca', 'oxford', 'poise', 'become', 'dominant', 'shot', 'country', 'program', 'government', 'several', 'local_government', 'early', 'enter', 'intro', 'tripartite', 'deal', 'drug', 'maker', 'secure', 'dose', 'filipino', 'read', 'stockpile', 'astrazeneca', 'reach', 'dose', 'supply', 'expect', 'arrive', 'sometime', 'year', 'though', 'early', 'say', 'government', 'negotiate', 'early', 'delivery', 'soon', 'possible', 'time', 'vaccine', 'eyed', 'buy', 'astrazeneca', 'company', 'far', 'expressed_willingness', 'enter', 'tripartite', 'deal', 'involve', 'local_government', 'company', 'say', 'open', 'setup', 'drug', 'maker', 'moderna', 'novavax', 'health', 'expert', 'early', 'say', 'astrazeneca', 'also', 'easier', 'distribute', 'inpoorer', 'hard', 'reach', 'area', 'consider', 'transport', 'handle', 'normal_refrigerate', 'condition', 'least', 'month', 'make', 'compatible', 'department', 'health', 'doh', 'storage_facilitie', 'early', 'analysis', 'clinical', 'trial', 'result', 'show', 'average', 'efficacy', 'first', 'dose', 'see', 'effective', 'participant', 'give', 'half', 'dose', 'follow', 'full', 'dose', 'compare', 'efficacy', 'see', 'participant', 'give', 'full', 'dose', 'fda', 'grant', 'astrazeneca', 'full', 'approval', 'secure', 'full', 'marketing', 'authority', 'necessary', 'commercialize', 'allow', 'sale', 'local', 'market', 'contingent', 'astrazeneca', 'commitment', 'finish', 'development', 'product', 'com']",0.9902,0.016,0.786,0.198,0.4573232323232324,Positive

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says the Philippines expects to receive about 5.1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and about 24.1 million doses in the second quarter
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said that the government is willing to pay more to secure earlier access to COVID-19 vaccines within the first half of the year.
Galvez made the statement during a televised meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday night, February 24, after setbacks in the delivery of initial doses delayed the start of the country’s inoculation campaign that was eyed to begin by February.""Iyong ongoing negotiation po natin sa mga ibang vaccine ay kailangan po na ina-ano po namin na kung puwede silang magkaroon ng early delivery. At nagne-negotiate din po tayo kahit mapamahal nang kaunti basta ma-early delivery lang po sila ng second quarter at saka po ng first quarter,"" Galvez said.
(In our ongoing negations for vaccines, we’re asking if it's possible to have an early delivery. We’re negotiating to have early delivery in the second and first quarter even if vaccines will be slightly more expensive.)
The retired general said that the Philippines expects to receive about 5.1 million doses in the first quarter of 2021, and about 24.1 million doses in the second quarter.He explained that the ""technique"" they're using is to try to get an earlier delivery of vaccines even at higher prices so that the increase in the prices could be ""offset earlier"" as well.
Galvez and other Philippine pandemic officials earlier targeted to start the country’s mass vaccination campaign by the end of February with doses of AstraZeneca and Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine to be supplied under the COVAX global facility. But paperwork and the lack of an indemnification law in the country have stalled the delivery of vaccines to be used on priority sectors including health workers, senior citizens, and vulnerable populations.Aside from vaccines to be supplied by COVAX, the Philippines is in talks to directly purchase shots from Moderna, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), US firms Pfizer and BioNTech, British firm AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac, and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute.Galvez said officials are also trying to negotiate with the United Kingdom, China, India, and Russia to increase vaccines expected to be delivered to the Philippines in the first quarter.Under the current timeline of deliveries, the Philippines expects to receive the bulk of vaccines in the third to fourth quarter of 2021 for a “major” rollout.Galvez said the Philippines is supposed to receive 161 million doses by the end of 2021 to vaccinate 50 to 70 million adult Filipinos “in a best case scenario.” This number would be just enough to reach the recommended 60% to 70% of the population to reach herd immunity against COVID-19, based on scientists' estimates. – Rappler.com

(3rd UPDATE) Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital, is the first to get the vaccine
Editor's Note: The nurse who administered the first shot to Dr Gerardo Legaspi is Charleuck Santos, not Sherlock Cruz. Cruz was the name provided by the Philippine Information Agency, and was corrected by the Department of Health.
The Philippine government on Monday, March 1, started distributing the first shots of a coronavirus vaccine, setting off an unprecedented and ambitious effort to inoculate at least 50 million people by the end of 2021.At 9:40 am, the first COVID-19 vaccine in the country was legally administered by nurse Charleuck Santos to Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (PGH), one of the few coronavirus-designated hospitals in the country.
Along with Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, government medical adviser Dr Edsel Salvana, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. were also vaccinated.
The hopeful step opens a new chapter in the Philippines' fight against the pandemic in spaces that have catered to the sickest. The disease has so far killed over 12,300 and infected over 576,000.Along with PGH, vaccinations on Monday take place among health workers at the Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center.Doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac were used for the start of the Duterte government’s first rollout, after arriving in the country through a transport plane of the People's Liberation Army of China on Sunday, February 28. The delivery of 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses, a donation from China, was witnessed by President Rodrigo Duterte, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.Inoculations took place after the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorization (EUA) for CoronaVac last Monday, February 22. Sinovac was the latest to be granted emergency approval in the Philippines, though its vaccine was the first to arrive after delays in paperwork stalled vaccines from the global COVAX Facility, which were initially supposed to arrive in mid-February.
Health workers were identified as the first group to receive the Sinovac vaccine, though their participation came after intense deliberation on whether to include them in the rollout. The FDA earlier said data from Phase 3 trials in Brazil, where a lower efficacy of 50.4% was observed, led experts not to recommend its use for priority groups.But with vaccine supplies scarce and the delivery of different brands uncertain, vaccine experts decided health workers should be given the chance to receive an available vaccine since they are most exposed to COVID-19.
In the meantime, as more vaccines have yet to be delivered, those who choose not to get the Sinovac vaccine are given assurances they will not lose their place in the government's prioritization.At PGH, health workers were reluctant to receive the Sinovac vaccine. Days before the rollout on Saturday, February 27, the PGH Physicians Association urged officials to wait for the review of the country’s Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) before using donated Sinovac vaccines.
Health experts pointed out the HTAC’s review was necessary as the body “does not solely focus on cost minimization issues for the State, but also include “ethical, legal, social, and health system implications.”

Along with the Presidential Security Group, former presidential special envoy Ramon Tulfo Jr. admitted to being inoculated with smuggled vaccines from Sinopharm along with other government officials in October 2020. He had also offered to supply the Sinopharm shot for President Rodrigo Duterte after the Chief Executive expressed interest in receiving the unapproved vaccines. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.9652000069618225,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['rd', 'update', 'director', 'university', 'first', 'get', 'editor', 'note', 'nurse', 'administer', 'first', 'shot', 'charleuck', 'santo', 'cruz', 'cruz', 'name', 'provide', 'information', 'agency', 'correct', 'department', 'health', 'government', 'march', 'start', 'distribute', 'first', 'shot', 'coronavirus', 'set', 'unprecedented', 'ambitious', 'effort', 'inoculate', 'least', 'people', 'end', 'first', 'country', 'nurse', 'charleuck', 'director', 'university', 'pgh', 'coronavirus', 'designate', 'hospital', 'country', 'food', 'government', 'medical', 'adviser', 'dr', 'edsel', 'salvana', 'also', 'vaccinate', 'hopeful', 'step', 'open', 'new', 'chapter', 'fight', 'pandemic', 'space', 'cater', 'sick', 'disease', 'far', 'kill', 'infect', 'pgh', 'vaccination', 'monday', 'take', 'place', 'health', 'worker', 'center', 'sanitarium', 'tala', 'veterans_memorial', 'medical_center', 'national', 'police', 'victoriano', 'medical_center', 'dose', 'coronavac', 'use', 'start', 'duterte', 'government', 'first', 'rollout', 'arrive', 'country', 'transport', 'plane', 'people', 'liberation', 'army', 'china', 'sunday', 'february', 'delivery', 'sinovac', 'dose', 'donation', 'china', 'witness', 'duterte', 'health', 'galvez_jr', 'inoculation', 'food', 'fda', 'issue', 'coronavac', 'last', 'monday', 'february', 'late', 'approval', 'first', 'arrive', 'delay', 'paperwork', 'stall', 'vaccine', 'global', 'covax_facility', 'initially', 'suppose', 'arrive', 'mid_february', 'health', 'worker', 'identify', 'first', 'group', 'receive', 'sinovac', 'participation', 'come', 'intense', 'deliberation', 'include', 'rollout', 'early', 'say', 'datum', 'phase', 'trial', 'brazil', 'low', 'efficacy', 'observe', 'lead', 'expert', 'recommend', 'use', 'priority_group', 'supply', 'scarce', 'delivery', 'different', 'brand', 'uncertain', 'expert', 'decide', 'health', 'worker', 'give', 'chance', 'receive', 'available', 'expose', 'meantime', 'vaccine', 'yet', 'deliver', 'choose', 'get', 'sinovac', 'give', 'assurance', 'lose', 'place', 'government', 'prioritization', 'pgh', 'health', 'worker', 'reluctant', 'receive', 'sinovac', 'day', 'rollout', 'pgh', 'physician', 'association', 'urge', 'official', 'wait', 'review', 'country', 'health', 'council', 'htac', 'use', 'donate', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'health', 'expert', 'point', 'htac', 'review', 'necessary', 'body', 'solely', 'focus', 'cost', 'minimization', 'issue', 'state', 'also', 'include', 'ethical', 'legal', 'social', 'health', 'system', 'implication', 'start', 'campaign', 'uncertainty', 'legal', 'vaccination', 'health', 'worker', 'government', 'official', 'choose', 'receive', 'sinovac', 'monday', 'first', 'legally', 'vaccinate', 'last', 'december', 'duterte', 'reveal', 'member', 'security', 'aide', 'first', 'receive', 'sinopharm', 'lack', 'require', 'emergency', 'authorization', 'read', 'nagging', 'question', 'duterte', 'gov', 'answer', 'use', 'unregistered', 'vaccine', 'group', 'former', 'presidential', 'special', 'envoy', 'ramon', 'admit', 'inoculate', 'smuggle', 'vaccine', 'sinopharm', 'government', 'official', 'also', 'offer', 'supply', 'sinopharm', 'shot', 'president_rodrigo', 'receive', 'unapproved', 'vaccine', 'com']",-0.8402,0.118,0.787,0.095,0.39258658008658,Negative

PART 1: Rappler sifts through plans of officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country
In February, the Philippines will embark on its biggest mass immunization campaign yet, as it prepares to dole out coronavirus vaccines that could end the health emergency – but not without testing the country’s strained health system and pandemic response once more.To get a picture of the scale of the challenge, consider this: Department of Health (DOH) Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje said the largest vaccination campaign the government has ever conducted, so far, involved inoculating about 29 million Filipinos. Annual routine immunization programs aim to reach about two million children nationwide.
But targets for a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 eclipse these figures, as the campaign aims to cover from 50 million to 70 million Filipinos in 2021 alone. Its desired end stage has a much more ambitious goal: reaching all 110 million Filipinos spread across the archipelago by 2024.For the unprecedented task, the government has partnered with the private sector to facilitate requirements needed for storage, delivery, to actual distribution and tracking of vaccines.In Part 1 of this explainer, Rappler sifts through plans of key officials involved in addressing the pandemic, particularly how vaccines will be delivered and stored in the country. In part 2, we will detail the government's strategy for distributing vaccines from storage facilities to the public.
Which vaccines may arrive first?
In a best case scenario, doses of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine may be the first to arrive in the Philippines come February. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said this could happen through the Gavi COVAX facility which planned to supply doses to low-income countries for an early rollout.
Pfizer is, so far, the only company that has secured emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) – a requirement necessary for any vaccine to be used on the public.
Aside from the Pfizer vaccine, Galvez said Sinovac and AstraZeneca's vaccines may be next to arrive in the country, considering that doses for the two vaccines were already secured in negotiations.
Both Sinovac and AstraZeneca still need to be cleared by the FDA. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the agency is waiting for Phase 3 trial data from Sinovac before it can move on to a full review, while AstraZeneca's EUA application is currently under evaluation.

Hospitals get priority for first vaccine doses arriving in February
How will vaccines be brought to the Philippines?
Galvez said delivery of vaccine supplies will be the responsibility of vaccine companies and manufacturers, based on current negotiations being finalized.Once vaccines arrive in the Philippines, officials will take up to 15 days to inspect the items, he said. At the House of Representatives and Senate, Galvez also asked lawmakers to pass legislation that would ensure the speedy release of doses from Customs, recalling similar past experiences where personal protective equipment couldn’t get to hospitals that needed them because of Customs requirements.Experts warned the rollout of vaccines could be severely delayed, and the quality of supplies compromised, if necessary measures were not taken to prevent the items from being held up in Customs. Where will vaccines be stored?
Health experts identified two strategies for storing vaccines, depending on their required temperature conditions.The first covers vaccines that need storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C and -20°C. For these, suppliers will transport doses to the Department of Health’s (DOH) rented private warehouse or the Research Institute of Tropical Medicine (RITM), which is the main storage location of vaccines used for the government’s National Immunization Program.
From here, vaccines will be transported to the DOH’s 17 centers for health development that serve as regional hubs.Citing their experience in storing vaccines for measles, polio, and other routine immunizations, the DOH earlier said there are enough storage facilities in the country for vaccines that need to be kept at 2°C to 8°C and -20°C. These include main sites in Metro Manila, regional centers, as well as provincial capitols.SCREENSHOT FROM DOH
What about vaccines needing ultralow temperature storage?
As for vaccines that will require -70°C or ultracold storage facilities, like those of Pfizer and BioNTech, distributors will transport doses to private warehouses of third party logistics providers tapped by the government.The DOH said final terms of agreements are still being discussed with companies with extensive experience in handling pharmaceutical products, including Zuellig Pharma Group, Royal Cargo, Orca, Maersk, LBC, and Metro Pacific, among others.This comes on top of the 10 ultralow freezers the government procured to store more vaccine doses requiring frigid temperatures, and 5 ultralow units available in RITM, that can store over 1.1 million doses.In an interview with Rappler, Zuellig chief business officer Jannette Jakosalem said the company has ordered 10 ultralow freezers that can each store about 400,000 to 500,000 vaccine doses. Zuellig Pharma – the biggest distributor of pharmaceutical goods in the Philippines – also has plans to purchase 4 more ultralow freezers for use in Cebu City and Davao City.
Partnerships with the logistical companies will be even more crucial in August, when the DOH will need assistance in storing vaccines needing storage temperatures of 2°C to 8°C.Duque earlier said that the DOH expected vaccines for its regular immunization programs to arrive by then, and that it was crucial for these child vaccination programs to continue amid a COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says 'more or less' 7 manufacturers will supply the vaccine doses for an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Wednesday, January 6, that the government is targeting to secure at least 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines for the country in 2021.The supply of 148 million, if fully secured, could cover some 70 million Filipinos, assuming two doses are needed per person. National Task Force deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said the government wanted to vaccinate 50 to 70 million people within the year.
Galvez said the 148 million-figure was based on current negotiations with “more or less 7” vaccine companies that the government was in advanced talks with, including Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), Sinovac, and Gamaleya.“We hope to close a deal with these companies this month,” he said in a virtual press briefing.What's the timeline?
Galvez did not give specific dates on when vaccine doses from these companies may arrive in the Philippines.He earlier said he expected Sinovac's vaccine to arrive in the Philippines as early as March, but this would depend on whether the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves the vaccine for emergency use. Sinovac has not yet applied for the necessary emergency use authorization (EUA) with the FDA.(READ: How FDA grants emergency approval for COVID-19 vaccines, meds)
So far, a solid purchase deal was signed with AstraZeneca, the government, and private sector in November 2020. This is for the purchase of some 3 million doses expected to arrive around the second quarter of 2021.Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, meanwhile, is applying for Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, while the FDA recently approved clinical trials for Janssen’s vaccine that could start later this month.Galvez also recently told President Rodrigo Duterte that the Serum Institute of India, which partnered with Novavax to produce its vaccine, promised to set aside 30 million doses for the Philippines.
As for Pfizer, no updates have been given after Galvez signed a confidentiality data agreement with the company in November 2020. Pfizer is the only vaccine company that has applied for an EUA with the FDA as of January 6. (READ: Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?)

TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Why it matters
Launching a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19 is crucial in taming the pandemic as soon as possible, though the Philippines has been lagging behind in a global race to secure supplies of the coveted good.
A recent study published in the BMJ medical journal found that based on advance purchase commitments, high income countries already reserved over half of doses to be supplied from 13 leading manufacturers.“Even if all 13 of these vaccine manufacturers were to succeed in reaching their maximum production capacity, at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022,” the study said. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.5376999974250793,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['say', 'less', 'manufacturer', 'supply', 'dose', 'initial', 'filipino', 'say', 'january', 'government', 'target', 'secure', 'least', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'country', 'supply', 'fully', 'secure', 'cover', 'filipino', 'assume', 'dose', 'need', 'person', 'force', 'deputy', 'say', 'government', 'want', 'vaccinate', 'people', 'year', 'galvez', 'say', 'figure', 'base', 'current', 'negotiation', 'less', 'company', 'government', 'advanced', 'talk', 'include', 'novavax', 'astrazeneca', 'pfizer', 'sinovac', 'gamaleya', 'hope', 'close', 'deal', 'company', 'month', 'say', 'brief', 's', 'timeline', 'galvez', 'give', 'specific', 'date', 'dose', 'company', 'arrive', 'early', 'say', 'expect', 'sinovac', 'arrive', 'early', 'march', 'depend', 'food', 'fda', 'approve', 'yet', 'apply', 'necessary', 'read', 'approval', 'vaccine', 'med', 'far', 'solid', 'purchase', 'deal', 'sign', 'astrazeneca', 'government', 'november', 'purchase', 'dose', 'expect', 'arrive', 'russia', 'gamaleya_research', 'institute', 'meanwhile', 'apply', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'recently', 'approve', 'clinical_trial', 'start', 'later', 'month', 'galvez', 'also', 'recently', 'tell', 'duterte', 'serum_institute', 'india', 'partner', 'novavax', 'produce', 'promise', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'update', 'give', 'galvez', 'sign', 'confidentiality', 'datum', 'agreement', 'company', 'november', 'pfizer', 'company', 'apply', 'january', 'read', 'duterte', 'govt', 'take', 'month', 'sign', 'deal', 'pfizer', 'must_read', 'tracker', 'vaccine', 'eyed', 'matter', 'launch', 'mass', 'vaccination', 'campaign', 'crucial', 'tame', 'pandemic', 'soon', 'possible', 'lag', 'global', 'race', 'secure', 'supply', 'covet', 'good', 'recent', 'study', 'publish', 'find', 'base', 'advance', 'purchase', 'commitment', 'high', 'income_countrie', 'already', 'reserve', 'dose', 'supply', 'lead', 'manufacturer', 'even', 'manufacturer', 'succeed', 'reach', 'maximum', 'production', 'capacity', 'least', 'fifth', 'world', 'population', 'access', 'vaccine', 'study', 'say', 'com']",0.9772,0.011,0.83,0.159,0.44821839080459763,Positive

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group is meeting to discuss how the initial 487,200 AstraZeneca doses will be distributed
The first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Philippines may be allocated for senior healthcare workers unable to receive Sinovac's CoronaVac, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Thursday, March 4.
Galvez said this strategy is being considered by members of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG), who were meeting to discuss how the initial 487,200 doses will be distributed across the country.""Most likely – may mga doctor kasi na nagsasabi i-priority natin 'yung mga senior healthcare workers…. Our recommendation is for 'yung mga senior healthcare workers,"" Galvez said in an interview with CNN Philippines' Pinky Webb.(Most likely – we have doctors who are saying we should prioritize senior healthcare workers. Our recommendation is for the senior healthcare workers [to get the AstraZeneca vaccine].)
Galvez gave the update as the Philippines is scheduled to receive its first delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine supplied by the global COVAX Facility on Thursday night. The delivery was supposed to be last Monday, March 1, but was stalled by logistical problems and supply concerns.
The 487,200 doses arriving on Thursday are fewer than the 525,600 doses the Philippines had first expected to receive last Monday.
Galvez said the smaller delivery is due to logistical and packaging constraints as the AstraZeneca vaccine will be delivered to the Philippines through a commercial flight.
Why this matters
Health officials are hoping more health workers will be inclined to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, the only other option to be made available so far aside from Sinovac's vaccine donated by China to the Philippines.
Two days since the Philippines started rolling out Sinovac's vaccine, only some 8,559 health workers have been vaccinated. Enthusiasm for the vaccine was muted amid concerns over its lower efficacy for health workers exposed to COVID-19 and the robustness of its data compared to other vaccines.
But while a considerable number of health workers had turned down Sinovac's vaccine, opting to wait for AstraZeneca's shot, doses are still extremely limited for the priority group.

'This has been given the go-signal by FDA,' says Food and Drug Administration Director General Enrique Domingo
The Philippines has approved the application of Janssen Pharmaceutica to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine in the country, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced on Tuesday, December 29.“Yesterday we already approved one, this is the clinical trial application of Janssen. This has been given the go-signal by FDA,” FDA Director General Enrique Domingo said in a press briefing.
With the regulatory aspect of its application done, the FDA chief said Janssen’s trials could begin in the “next few weeks” after the Department of Science and Technology assigns areas to be included and recruits volunteers.The Janssen Pharmaceutica trials mark the first late stage trials for a COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines. The company is one of 3 firms that applied for trials in the country, with China’s Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals still undergoing regulatory review.Domingo welcomed the start of Janssen’s trials, saying these would allow the Philippines to contribute to worldwide knowledge on the development of a COVID-19 vaccine. The trials will also help scientists and medical experts confirm the effects of the vaccine on Filipinos.MUST READ
TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Janssen, the pharmaceutical firm of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a vaccine using a“non-replicating viral vector” called Adenovirus 26, whichhas been genetically engineered so it can still invade cells but can’t replicate and cause disease. The company used the same method to develop vaccines for Ebola and other diseases.Unlike most other candidates, Janssen’s vaccine utilizes a single dose. Despite this, the company said it would use some Phase 3 trials to study the effects of two doses given 56 days apart.Its vaccine can also be stored in standard refrigerated facilities, making the prospect of distributing and administering vaccines easier for lower income countries like the Philippines. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.9940999746322632,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['give', 'go_signal', 'say', 'food', 'director_general', 'domingo', 'approve', 'application', 'conduct', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'country', 'food', 'announce', 'tuesday', 'yesterday', 'already', 'approve', 'clinical', 'trial', 'application', 'janssen', 'give', 'go_signal', 'say', 'press_briefe', 'regulatory', 'aspect', 'application', 'do', 'chief', 'say', 'janssen', 'trial', 'begin', 'next', 'week', 'department', 'science', 'technology', 'assign', 'area', 'include', 'recruit', 'volunteer', 'trial', 'mark', 'first', 'late_stage', 'trial', 'company', 'firm', 'apply', 'trial', 'country', 'china', 'sinovac', 'clover', 'still', 'undergo', 'regulatory', 'review', 'domingo', 'welcome', 'start', 'janssen', 'trial', 'say', 'allow', 'contribute', 'worldwide', 'knowledge', 'development', 'trial', 'also', 'help', 'scientist', 'medical', 'expert', 'confirm', 'effect', 'filipino', 'tracker', 'vaccine', 'eyed', 'johnson_johnson', 'develop', 'use', 'non', 'replicate', 'viral', 'vector', 'call', 'adenovirus', 'whichha', 'genetically', 'engineer', 'still', 'invade', 'cell', 'replicate', 'cause', 'disease', 'company', 'use', 'method', 'develop', 'vaccine', 'ebola', 'disease', 'candidate', 'utilize', 'single', 'dose', 'company', 'say', 'use', 'phase', 'trial', 'study', 'effect', 'dose', 'give', 'day', 'apart', 'also', 'store', 'standard', 'refrigerate', 'facility', 'make', 'prospect', 'distribute', 'administer', 'vaccine', 'easier', 'low', 'income_countrie', 'com']",0.8591,0.014,0.9,0.085,0.26845238095238094,Positive

The vaccines will come a day after Sinovac’s CoronaVac arrives in the country
The Philippines will receive 525,600 doses of vaccines developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford on Monday, March 1, Presidential Spokesperson confirmed on Saturday, February 27.
The vaccines are part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX facility, from which the Philippines is entitled to 44 million COVID-19 vaccine doses. (READ: What is COVAX and why does it matter for getting vaccines to developing nations?)
“We thank the World Health Organization (WHO), the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) towards this end,” Roque said.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine on January 28.
This is the second batch of vaccines expected to arrive in the country. The government previously announced that it is expecting on Sunday, February 28, 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines.

(UPDATED) This first shipment from the COVAX Facility, together with the earlier Sinovac doses, gives the country the ability to vaccinate over 540,000 individuals
Close to 500,000 doses of the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University arrived in the Philippines aboard a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines commercial plane on Thursday night, March 4.
The shipment arrived around 7:20 pm at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Metro Manila.
The vaccines were picked up from Belgium and had a stopover in Bangkok, Thailand, before heading to NAIA in Metro Manila.
President Rodrigo Duterte welcomed the shipment in a ceremony at the Villamor Air Base that was delayed because he arrived two hours late, at around 9:30 pm.
From there, the vaccines were to be brought to a warehouse of logistics company Metropac Logistics in Marikina City.
Testament to collaboration
In his speech at the ceremony, Duterte thanked the COVAX Facility, United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund, WHO, and ambassadors who made the vaccine shipment possible.
Meanwhile, WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr Dr Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the arrival of the AstraZeneca shipment is a ""testament to the strength of collaboration, cooperation, and compassion.""
He also praised Duterte's ""strong leadership"" amid the pandemic.
According to the National Task Force Against COVID-19, the distribution of the vaccines throughout the country will ""immediately commence after repackaging.""
A total of 487,200 doses arrived, less than the 525,600 doses the government expected to receive last Monday, March 1.
The smaller delivery was due to logistical and packaging constraints that came with the commercial flight, according to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
The AstraZeneca vaccine, known as AZD1222, is a viral vector vaccine that requires two doses and can be stored in normal refrigerator temperatures (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).
It is composed of an adenovirus derived from chimpanzees and modified to train the vaccine recipient's immune system to fight the virus that causes COVID-19.
First from COVAX Facility
The AstraZeneca shipment is the first shipment of vaccines from the COVAX Facility led by the World Health Organization, an initiative that ensures equitable access of COVID-19 jabs in developing countries.
The delivery came through after an expected shipment of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine – also secured through COVAX – did not arrive in mid-February as earlier promised by the government.
The Pfizer shots were supposed to have been the country's first COVID-19 vaccines.
The delay was due to the country's lack of an indemnification law, as well as disagreements over the scope of indemnity for Pfizer.
The Pfizer shots from COVAX are now expected to arrive in the 2nd quarter of 2021, or April at the earliest.
First shipments reserved for medical frontliners
The AstraZeneca doses, along with the first shipment of Sinovac vaccines, bring the Philippines' number of COVID-19 vaccine doses to 1,087,200.
This is good for only 543,600 individuals or 32% of the 1.7 million health workers deemed a priority of the vaccination program.
However, the Philippines is set to procure 1 million more doses of CoronaVac, the Sinovac vaccine, this month, according to Galvez. This would bring the number of doses to nearly 2.1 million or enough for 1,043,600 individuals.
The AstraZeneca doses are being eyed for elderly health workers since the Food and Drug Administration did not recommend CoronaVac for persons older than 59 years old.
However, this will still depend on the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 vaccines (NITAG), the government vaccine experts crafting recommendations on how approved vaccines are to be administered.
The NITAG held a meeting earlier on Thursday to formulate such guidelines for the AstraZeneca vaccines.
As of Wednesday evening, March 3, the Philippines has vaccinated 9,077 individuals, mostly health workers in Metro Manila.

The President again declares his vote of confidence for China and Russia vaccines, saying he prefers them to US vaccines
Stepping up his populist messaging during the pandemic, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said his goal is for his government to shoulder COVID-19 vaccination for each Filipino.
He declared this during a ""message to the people"" aired late Wednesday, October 14, after his meeting with coronavirus task force officials.
""I have the money already for the vaccine. But hahanap pa ako ng maraming pera (I will look for more money) because, you know, there are now 113 million Filipinos and to me, ideally, all should have the vaccine. Without exception, lahat (all),"" said Duterte. ([PODCAST] Duterte, Trump, Bolsonaro: The 'medical populists')
This departs from his previous speeches when he said wealthy Filipinos will not get such assistance from the government because they can ""buy their own vaccine.""
Duterte reiterated that priority will be given to the poorest Filipino households (specifically those listed as conditional cash transfer beneficiaries), soldiers, and police. The Chief Executive previously said he trusts only the military to distribute the vaccine when it becomes available.
Can the government afford it?
No economic manager was present at the Wednesday meeting. So far, we know that Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III targets a P20-billion fund for the purchase of a COVID-19 vaccine.
This fund will come from a loan to be provided by the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government financial institutions. The loan will be given to the Philippine International Trading Corp, which has been authorized to purchase vaccines for the government.
This fund is to shoulder only an ""initial"" batch of vaccines.
Apart from this, there's a P2.5-billion allocation for vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget.
Preference for China, Russia vaccines
Though Duterte never lacks in emphasizing his dire need for an effective COVID-19 vaccine, he indicated a preference for certain vaccines in his Wednesday speech.
""Para sa akin (For me), it's either China or Russia, okay na ako (I'm okay with that),"" he said.
""Wala akong – sinasabi nila Pfizer, Moderna, 'yung western, US. Okay rin 'yan kasi may proseso nga eh,"" Duterte continued. (I have nothing – they say Pfizer, Moderna, the western, US. They're also okay because there's a process.)
But he reserved a ringing vote of confidence for a Chinese or Russian vaccine, saying he'd be ""glad to open up [his] sleeves"" for an injection if China or Russia would just give him a call.
""Those of you who are asking if the Chinese vaccines are safe? I can say China is a modern country and it has all the wherewithals to make its country whose integrity is fully protected by its achievement,"" said Duterte.

As for Russia, the President said he had spoken to outgoing Russian Ambassador Igor Khovaev about plans to put up Russian pharmaceutical facilities in the Philippines.
The conversation took place during Khovaev's farewell call to Duterte at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse earlier that day.
Philippine vaccine experts are still studying documents sent over by Russia's Gamaleya Institute about the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of its vaccine, Sputnik V. The expert panel will decide whether or not to green-light Phase 3 clinical trials for the vaccine in the Philippines.
Duterte has declared he has so much confidence in the Russian vaccine that he is willing to be the first to get inoculated with it.
Though Duterte is partial to a China or Russia vaccine, the Philippines is also participating in the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility.
Through this initiative, the Philippines is assured a supply of some 20% of its vaccine needs, a supply that would likely include whatever vaccine is proven effective, whether or not from China or Russia.

'How can the health workers convince the community to get vaccinated if they themselves are not sold on COVID-19 vaccines?' says Apasrah Mapupuno, the head of Lanao del Sur's health team
According to one rumor circulating in the Philippines, the coronavirus vaccine will allow President Rodrigo Duterte to kill people at the push of a button.
Elsewhere in the country of 108 million, memories of a dengue vaccine that has been banned locally are putting people off the idea of immunization even before the campaign begins.
""Many kids got sick after receiving that vaccine,"" 62-year-old Crisanta Alipio said of the ill-fated vaccine against dengue, a mosquito-borne disease that can be deadly.
She said she was afraid of the novel coronavirus but even more afraid of vaccination.
The Philippines is due to start immunizations next month despite suffering Southeast Asia's second-worst outbreak of the coronavirus with more than half a million infections and over 10,000 deaths.
But officials acknowledge they have an uphill struggle to persuade many people to take it, on top of the logistical difficulties in reaching 2,000 inhabited islands with a precarious health system in the Southeast Asian archipelago.
""Messaging has to be very concrete and evidence-based to encourage people to receive the vaccines,"" health undersecretary Rosario Vergeire told Reuters.
""We are assuring Filipinos that whatever vaccines that will be brought in and provided will go through a stringent process of regulation.""
Dengvaxia scare
Confidence in vaccines was knocked by controversy over French company Sanofi's Dengvaxia.
Rolled out rapidly in 2016 to more than 800,000 children to protect them from dengue – it was banned after its maker said it could worsen the disease in people who had not previously been exposed to the infection.
That led to two congressional enquiries and more than 100 criminal cases that linked child deaths to the anti-dengue shot – though such links have never been proved.
Sanofi has repeatedly said Dengvaxia is safe and effective and the vaccine has been approved for use by the United States and European Union.
After that episode, the Philippines fell from one of the top 10 countries for confidence in vaccines to no higher than 70th place. The number of children who were fully vaccinated fell from 85% in 2010 to 69% in 2019.
To address the fears, health workers would hold town hall and online meetings and be given special training on how to answer questions, said Carlito Galvez, a former army general running the anti-COVID-19 campaign, told the Senate.
The aim is to inoculate 70 million adults this year.

'Big problem'
In parts of the southern Philippines, the big fear is of a state-sponsored death campaign – not completely far-fetched in a country where Duterte's drug war has left nearly 6,000 thousand dead since he took office in 2016.
Remote southern regions are the scene of both communist and Islamist insurgencies.
""Some of the information shared on Facebook and text messages said the COVID-19 vaccine contained a microchip which can be controlled remotely by President Duterte, and once he pushes a button, the person who received the vaccine will die,"" said Nasser Alimoda, a government doctor in Lanao del Sur province.
Everywhere, there is concern over the specific vaccines that the Philippines plans to use too – particularly over Chinese company Sinovac Biotech's vaccine, for which one study showed effectiveness of little over 50%, though another gave it over 91%.
One opinion poll showed fewer than a third of Filipinos were willing to get inoculated against coronavirus.
""Vaccination programs will go to waste if people refuse to get the shots,"" a former health minister, Esperanza Cabral, told Reuters.
Apasrah Mapupuno, the head of the government's Lanao del Sur health team, said she had asked dozens of health workers and others if they would roll up their sleeves for a COVID-19 vaccines.

Top Duterte government officials and soldiers are among the first to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in the Philippines
Ahead of hundreds of thousands of health workers across the Philippines, some Cabinet officials and soldiers have already been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, officials confirmed on Monday, December 28.
“I know some from the Cabinet and from the presidential security guards,” Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Eduardo Año said in an interview with dzMM.
Meanwhile, Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Cirilto Sobejana confirmed that soldiers have been inoculated in an interview with dwIZ on the same day, adding that he did not know which vaccine provider the immunizations came from.
Keeping it secret
Sobejana declined to name the unit where the soldiers belonged to, but Año identified the Presidential Security Group (PSG) – which is composed of soldiers, cops, coast guards, and civilian personnel – as a beneficiary of the early vaccination.The Armed Forces of the Philippines, in a statement on Monday afternoon, confirmed that the soldiers belonged to the PSG.
As for the Cabinet officials, Año declined to name them, citing their right to privacy. Año appeared to have one Cabinet official in mind when he was asked to reveal their identities.
“I cannot confirm it unless that person will say that he’s confirmed [to have had the vaccine]. Only he can give the confirmation,” Año said.
Was the process followed?
Año and Sobejana said the vaccination was necessary as the Cabinet officials and soldiers were considered frontliners. It is unclear if they followed the government’s own process for vaccine approval.
Under Duterte’s own order, only the Food and Drug Authority can issue emergency use authorizations (EUAs), which could cut the review period of 6 months down to 1 month only.Duterte signed the order on December 2. It is unclear how the vaccines were properly processed in such short period of time.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr says that once doses are delivered to the Philippines, some 50,000 health workers in Metro Manila could be vaccinated in February
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said on Monday, January 11, the Duterte government could begin distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the public as soon as February 2021.Galvez told Senators that initial doses of a vaccine may arrive in the country by February 20 at the earliest, and that based on this timeline, public inoculation may begin “more or less” in the 3rd to 4th week of the month.Galvez, however, issued a disclaimer that delivery dates were still “indicative” and that actual delivery could happen at least 1 to 2 weeks earlier or later.“Safe to say we will be having that maybe last week of February,” Galvez said, referring to the rollout of vaccines, when pressed by Senator Panfilo Lacson to provide a starting date for vaccination.Galvez said doses expected to arrive in February would “most likely” come from GAVI’s COVAX facility, with the multilateral initiative currently finalizing deals to distribute some 30 billion doses of a vaccine to developing countries for an early rollout.World Health Organization country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said negotiations were taking place to finalize a deal that could include Philippines in countries to receive doses for an early rollout, adding Pfizer and BioNTech’s was among vaccines being considered for this set up.
Aside from this, Galvez said China’s Sinovac vaccine may also arrive as early as February, with necessary agreements to be signed later in the week.Who will get the vaccine first?
Health officials earlier said the government would prioritize distributing COVID-19 vaccines to priority groups including frontline health workers in high risk areas such as Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Cebu City, and Davao City.Galvez said officials estimated some 50,000 health workers in Metro Manila could be vaccinated in February once supplies arrive, while some 2 million more could be immunized by April.MUST READ

What's the status with negotiations?
The Philippines has so far signed deals to purchase at least 30 to 40 million doses of Novavax’ vaccine, while tripartite agreements with local government units and the national government has secured at least 13 million of AstraZeneca’s vaccine for Filipinos.
Aside from this, the country is finalizing deals with Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceuticals), Moderna, and Gamaleya. Galvez expressed confidence that the government could lock in deals with these companies to secure at least 100 million doses within the year.If all deals in advanced negations were successful, Galvez said the country could purchase some 148 million doses in 2021 to vaccinate some 50 to 70 million Filipinos. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.9961000084877014,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['say', 'dose', 'deliver', 'health', 'worker', 'metro', 'vaccinate', 'february', 'say', 'january', 'duterte', 'government', 'begin', 'distribute', 'vaccine', 'public', 'soon', 'february', 'galvez', 'tell', 'senator', 'initial', 'dose', 'arrive', 'country', 'early', 'base', 'timeline', 'public', 'inoculation', 'begin', 'less', 'rd', 'week', 'month', 'galvez', 'however', 'issue', 'disclaimer', 'delivery', 'date', 'still', 'indicative', 'actual', 'delivery', 'happen', 'least', 'week', 'early', 'later', 'safe', 'maybe', 'last_week', 'february', 'galvez', 'say', 'refer', 'rollout', 'vaccine', 'press', 'lacson', 'provide', 'starting', 'date', 'vaccination', 'galvez', 'say', 'dose', 'expect', 'arrive', 'february', 'likely', 'come', 'gavi', 'covax_facility', 'multilateral', 'initiative', 'currently', 'finalize', 'deal', 'distribute', 'dose', 'develop', 'country', 'early', 'rollout', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'country', 'representative', 'rabindra_abeyasinghe', 'say', 'negotiation', 'take', 'place', 'finalize', 'deal', 'include', 'country', 'receive', 'dose', 'early', 'rollout', 'add', 'vaccine', 'consider', 'galvez', 'say', 'china', 'sinovac', 'also', 'arrive', 'early', 'february', 'necessary', 'agreement', 'sign', 'later', 'week', 'get', 'first', 'health', 'official', 'early', 'say', 'government', 'prioritize', 'distribute', 'vaccine', 'priority_group', 'include', 'frontline', 'health', 'worker', 'high_risk', 'area', 'metro', 'calabarzon', 'cebu', 'city', 'davao_city', 'galvez', 'say', 'official', 'estimate', 'health', 'worker', 'metro', 'vaccinate', 'february', 'supply', 'arrive', 'immunize', 'prioritize', 'area', 'sector', 'rollout', 's', 'status', 'negotiation', 'far', 'sign', 'deal', 'purchase', 'least', 'dose', 'novavax', 'tripartite', 'agreement', 'local', 'government', 'unit', 'national', 'government', 'secure', 'least', 'astrazeneca', 'filipino', 'country', 'finalize', 'deal', 'pharmaceutical', 'moderna', 'gamaleya', 'galvez', 'express', 'confidence', 'government', 'lock', 'deal', 'company', 'secure', 'least', 'dose', 'year', 'deal', 'advanced', 'negation', 'successful', 'galvez', 'say', 'country', 'purchase', 'dose', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'com']",0.969,0.0,0.896,0.104,0.38655913978494616,Positive

President Rodrigo Duterte defends Chinese-made vaccines, claiming they are every bit as reliable as Western ones
The Philippines has signed an agreement for 25 million doses of CoronaVac, the coronavirus vaccine of Chinese firm Sinovac.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr confirmed this in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 13.
""They gave a commitment, and I signed the term sheet and had a copy of the signed term sheet for 25 million [doses] sent to Hong Kong,"" he said in Filipino.
An initial batch of 50,000 doses is expected to arrive in the country on February 20, to be followed by 950,000 more doses in March.
Galvez praised Sinovac for being the ""only"" vaccine maker to give definite monthly delivery dates for its doses.
Why this matters
The signing of the term sheet adds to the Philippines' list of agreements, locking in millions of the sought-after jabs for Filipinos.
Previously signed were deals for 30 million doses of the vaccine of US firm Novavax and 15 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through tripartite agreements with local governments and private corporations.
However, the Food and Drug Administration is yet to approve any vaccine for emergency use. Of the 3 vaccines secured through signed deals, only AstraZeneca has applied for emergency use approval as of writing.

Duterte defends Chinese vaccines
In the same meeting, Duterte defended Chinese-made vaccines, claiming they are every bit as reliable as Western ones.
""It's as good as any other bakuna na na-imbento ng mga Amerikano or mga Europeans. Hindi nag-kulang ang Chinese, hindi sila nagkulang sa utak,"" said the Philippine leader.
(It's as good as vaccines invented by the Americans or Europeans. These Chinese don't lack in brains.)
""Kung kayong walang pera at gusto ninyo ng bakuna na mas maganda, mas mabisa, wala, tabla lahat ‘yan. Pareho lang ang pinag-aralan nila,"" Duterte also said.
(If you don't have money and you want a vaccine that is better, more effective, that's nothing, all of them are equal. They all have the same expertise.)
The Sinovac vaccine, however, has raised eyebrows for producing very different efficacy rates across various clinical trial sites.
In Brazil, where Sinovac's biggest clinical trial is being conducted, the vaccine was initially said to be 78% effective in preventing mild cases of COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing severe infections. But new data showed that the overall efficacy rate is 50.38%.
Sinovac has also published less clinical trial data compared to Western vaccine makers. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.5171999931335449,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['duterte', 'defend', 'chinese', 'make', 'vaccine', 'claim', 'bit', 'reliable', 'western', 'one', 'sign', 'agreement', 'dose', 'coronavac', 'coronavirus', 'chinese', 'firm', 'sinovac', 'confirm', 'meet', 'duterte', 'give', 'commitment', 'sign', 'copy', 'sign', 'dose', 'send', 'kong', 'say', 'filipino', 'initial', 'batch', 'dose', 'expect', 'arrive', 'country', 'february', 'follow', 'dose', 'march', 'galvez', 'praise', 'sinovac', 'maker', 'give', 'definite', 'monthly', 'delivery', 'date', 'dose', 'matter', 'sign', 'add', 'list', 'agreement', 'lock', 'million', 'seek', 'jab', 'filipino', 'previously', 'sign', 'deal', 'dose', 'firm', 'novavax', 'dose', 'astrazeneca', 'tripartite', 'agreement', 'local_government', 'private', 'corporation', 'however', 'food', 'yet', 'approve', 'vaccine', 'secure', 'sign', 'deal', 'astrazeneca', 'apply', 'approval', 'write', 'must_read', 'tracker', 'vaccine', 'eyed', 'duterte', 'defend', 'chinese', 'vaccine', 'meeting', 'duterte', 'defend', 'chinese', 'make', 'vaccine', 'claim', 'bit', 'reliable', 'western', 'one', 'good', 'bakuna', 'na', 'na', 'ng', 'mga', 'mga', 'european', 'hindi', 'nag', 'kulang', 'ang', 'chinese', 'hindi', 'sila', 'nagkulang', 'sa', 'say', 'leader', 'good', 'vaccine', 'invent', 'american', 'european', 'chinese', 'do', 'nt', 'lack', 'brain', 'kung', 'kayong', 'walang', 'pera', 'gusto', 'ng', 'bakuna', 'na', 'maganda', 'mabisa', 'wala', 'tabla', 'lahat', 'lang', 'ang', 'duterte', 'also', 'say', 'do', 'nt', 'money', 'want', 'well', 'effective', 's', 'equal', 'expertise', 'sinovac', 'however', 'raise', 'eyebrow', 'produce', 'different', 'efficacy', 'rate', 'various', 'clinical', 'trial', 'site', 'brazil', 'sinovacs', 'big', 'clinical', 'trial', 'conduct', 'initially', 'say', 'effective', 'prevent', 'mild', 'case', 'effective', 'prevent', 'severe', 'infection', 'new', 'datum', 'show', 'overall', 'sinovac', 'also', 'publish', 'less', 'clinical', 'trial', 'datum', 'compare', 'western', 'maker', 'com']",0.9859,0.032,0.776,0.193,0.25796602387511475,Positive

(UPDATED) Here’s what you need to know about the process of approving clinical trials, when a COVID-19 vaccine might be rolled out, and who might receive it first
Over 9 months into the pandemic, scientists around the world continue to develop a viable COVID-19 vaccine as countries fight the spread of the new virus that has infected millions.
Here in the Philippines, a panel of vaccine experts under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) has been reviewing a roster of potential vaccines with the interest of conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the country.

Searching for a coronavirus vaccine: What PH clinical trials will look like
Filipino diplomats abroad have also been in talks with vaccine developers and manufacturers to make sure the Philippines has access to an effective vaccine once it becomes available. Among these are vaccines being developed in the US and China.
But these efforts are only half the challenge in ensuring Filipinos are able to receive a COVID-19 vaccine once it is ready for mass use.
While clinical trials and discussions take place with vaccine developers, any potential vaccine will still need to go through regulatory processes in the Philippines before studies here can begin, or the use of vaccines can be allowed.That includes vaccines President Rodrigo Duterte has shown a preference for – like Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine and those being developed by research and pharmaceutical firms in China or the United States’ Moderna.On Wednesday, December 2, Duterte issued an executive order allowing the Food and Drug Administration to grant emergency use authorization for vaccines. This makes granting the necessary FDA approval for vaccines quicker as it can be issued 21 days after a government agency or company asks it to evaluate a particular vaccine.
Here’s what you need to know about how the Philippines will approve trials, how they will be regulated, and when a COVID-19 vaccine might be rolled out to the public.What's a clinical trial?
Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect humans’ health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.Trials need to be carefully designed, reviewed, and approved before they can start. Like most clinical trials, tests for a COVID-19 vaccine consist of 3 phases to determine its safety and efficacy.In the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is the body tasked with regulating clinical trials.Why regulate trials?
Clinical trials deal with humans as subjects. FDA Director General Eric Domingo said this means that in any study, “the primary concern is always their human rights and safety.”By regulating trials, there is oversight in the way these are crafted, ensuring that trials meet good clinical practice standards and are able to ethically conduct tests involving humans.What might this look like? Domingo said participants should be able to understand fully what trial they are volunteering to join, as well as its benefits and risks. Volunteers should also know what safeguards will be afforded them, like close monitoring, checkups, and health insurance. Participants should also be free to leave the study.In regulating trials, the FDA will also form its own panel of experts to review adverse events that could occur during trials. This will be apart from the clinical trial expert team and safety monitoring committee part of the DOST.
Aside from this, clinical trials are regulated to ensue the integrity of data collected, which will be used to determine whether or not a treatment is ultimately safe and effective. This is especially true in the case of vaccines, which require extreme safety since they are designed to be given to millions of healthy people.
Who can conduct trials?
Only establishments with an FDA-issued license to operate as a clinical trial sponsor or contract research organization can conduct trials in the Philippines. This ensures that the group carrying out the research is legitimate and has the capacity to conduct such studies.In the case of Phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines, interested groups will also need to secure the endorsement of the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel (VEP) and ethics review board.The added step in securing approval from the country’s VEP and ethics board is unique to COVID-19 vaccine trials, Domingo said, because the global search for a vaccine has become much more accelerated due to the pandemic.In this case, the VEP reviews data from Phase 1 and 2 trials of vaccine development companies that intend to conduct Phase 3 trials in the country. Meanwhile, the ethics board ensures that prospective trials will be carried out in such a way that the rights and health of volunteers are protected.What vaccine companies are interested in trials?

TRACKER: Which COVID-19 vaccines are being eyed by the Philippines?
Domingo said it may take at least 21 days for FDA regulatory reviewers to evaluate and process applications of companies seeking to do trials. This includes 14 days for initial evaluation and a period of 7 days for applicants to respond to any clarifications.After this, the FDA is expected to issue a decision on applications in not more than 8 days after it receives the recommendation of regulatory reviewers.Vaccine experts earlier eyed to have Phase 3 trials start by October, though this has been moved to November 2020.
After trials, what happens next?
Once clinical trials are successfully completed and a vaccine is demonstrated to be safe and effective for humans, companies can apply for a certificate of product registration. The FDA is again in charge of evaluating and approving these.Conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines is not a prerequisite for a vaccine to be registered for use in the country.In evaluating a vaccine or any type of medicine, the FDA reviews its scientific data and can also consult with other similar regulatory bodies in other countries to compare findings.Apart from this, the Philippines is also a participant in the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization COVAX facility designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.

What is COVAX and why does it matter for getting vaccines to developing nations?
When will a vaccine be available – and who will receive it first?
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr has said the soonest a vaccine may arrive in the Philippines would be sometime between May to June in 2021 at best, though a more “realistic” timeline was late 2021 to early 2022.While many candidate vaccines are still in their development phase, manufacturers have also begun the work of preparing for production and distribution.
In the Philippines, the Department of Health (DOH) is in the planning phase of how to handle the complex procurement, storage, and distribution of vaccines once they are available.In administering the vaccines to Filipinos, the DOH has experience in carrying out mass vaccination programs through similar campaigns done in the past for vaccine-preventable diseases like measles and polio.Duterte earlier said he wanted the entire Filipino population inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine “without exception,” adding that his goal was for the government to shoulder the costs for the country’s 113 million population.This remains unlikely for now. In reality, the DOH said it lacked P10 billion of the P12.1 billion needed to vaccinate an initial priority population of 20 million Filipinos.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez earlier said the country aims to source P73.2 billion ($1.5 billion) to pay for the COVID-19 vaccinations of 60 million Filipinos.Funds will be taken from loans from multilateral agencies like the Asian Development Bank and World Bank; domestic sources like LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines, and government corporations, and bilateral sources from countries where a vaccine is being developed.
As for who may receive the vaccine from the government first, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III gave an overview of groups to be prioritized. These include the following:Health care workers (including those in public and private hospitals, barangay health stations, COVID-19 treatment and rehabilitation centers)
Government frontline workers (including those in the Department of Social Welfare and Development, Department of Education, Bureau of Corrections, Bureau of Fire Protection, Bureau of Jail Management and Penology)

https://www.rappler.com/nation/philippines-clears-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-emergency-use,Philippines clears Pfizer vaccine for emergency use,SOFIA TOMACRUZ,2021-01-14 11:47:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
(UPDATED) The Food and Drug Administration's decision paves the way for the Pfizer vaccine to be given to Filipinos, but actual delivery remains uncertain as the government has yet to finalize a supply deal with the company
The Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an emergency use authorization (EAU) for Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine, clearing the way for its use in a country hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia.
The historic approval – a first of its kind in the Philippines – was issued on Thursday, January 14, marking a milestone in the country’s fight against the disease which has so far infected over 492,000 people and killed nearly 10,000.""The FDA today is granting an emergency use authorization to Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine. It is decided that all conditions for an EUA are present and that the benefit of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risks,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced in a virtual press briefing.Domingo said that the vaccine met the Philippines’ conditions for securing an EUA. In particular, evidence from well known and controlled trials showed that “it is reasonable to believe” that the vaccine may be effective to “prevent, diagnose, or treat COVID-19.”
Aside from this, the FDA’s assessment concluded that known and potential benefits of the Pfizer vaccine outweighed its known and potential risks.Why it matters
In a best case scenario, the FDA decision would mean that the Pfizer vaccine can be distributed to Filipinos in a matter of weeks, with health and pandemic officials targeting an initial rollout by the end of February.In reality, the timeline of the vaccine administration and the actual number of doses that will arrive remain uncertain as the government has yet to finalize a supply deal with Pfizer. (READ: Why did the Duterte gov't take months to sign a vaccine deal with Pfizer?)
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said the company committed to deliver 25 to 40 million doses to the Philippines if there was excess supply from the United Stares and other countries which had secured orders earlier.
For now, the identified February rollout will greatly depend on whether or not the country is included in the GAVI COVAX facility’s list of states that may get doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for an early rollout pegged for the coming month.Galvez said the government would submit an appeal to COVAX by January 15 to have the Philippines included among countries that will be given a share of doses. Between January 19 to 29, officials from the COVAX facility are also scheduled to inspect ultracold chain storage facilities necessary to keep Pfizer’s vaccine stable, as part of its assessment on whether the country was ready to receive it.Aside from demonstrating 95% efficacy, Pfizer's vaccine offers a boost of hope in taming the pandemic as preliminary studies showed it would likely remain effective against mutations of COVID-19.
The FDA’s decision comes 22 days after Pfizer officials filed an EUA application with the agency. Pfizer was the first to apply for emergency use in the Philippines, followed by British drug maker AstraZeneca.Worth noting
Once the first batch of the Pfizer vaccine arrives in the country, Galvez said it can only be distributed in Metro Manila, Cebu City, and Davao City, as these areas have the facilities to keep the vaccine at a temperature of -70°C (- 94 degrees Fahrenheit).The actual distribution would also be complicated. Health experts have cited the necessary preparation to handle the new vaccine when administering it to patients.
Pfizer officials earlier explained that while doses may last up to 6 months in ultra-low temperature freezers, they can be stored up to 30 days in thermal shippers the company designed, and up to 5 days in normal refrigerated 2-8°C conditions – posing a challenge for the Philippines’ health system.Frontline health workers in areas reporting high incidence of cases are among those prioritized to receive initial doses of the vaccine.
While the FDA granted Pfizer an EUA, it is not full approval. Securing full marketing authority– which is necessary to commercialize the vaccine – would be contingent on Pfizer’s commitment to finish development of the product.More on Pfizer
In November 2020, Pfizer became among the first companies to announce results showing its vaccine was 95% effective. The findings shattered expectations of a vaccine developed at breakneck speed and offered hope that the end of the pandemic was in sight.The Philippines is the latest country to clear the Pfizer vaccine, after the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Germany, Australia, and Israel, among other countries – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.9889000058174133,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['update', 'food', 'drug', 'administration', 'decision', 'pave', 'way', 'pfizer', 'give', 'filipino', 'actual', 'delivery', 'remain', 'uncertain', 'government', 'yet', 'finalize', 'supply', 'deal', 'company', 'food', 'fda', 'issue', 'authorization', 'eau', 'clear', 'way', 'use', 'country', 'pandemic', 'historic', 'approval', 'first', 'kind', 'issue', 'thursday', 'january', 'mark', 'milestone', 'country', 'fight', 'disease', 'far', 'infected', 'people', 'kill', 'nearly', 'today', 'grant', 'authorization', 'decide', 'condition', 'present', 'benefit', 'use', 'outweigh', 'known', 'potential_risk', 'announce', 'brief', 'domingo', 'say', 'meet', 'condition', 'secure', 'particular', 'evidence', 'well', 'know', 'control', 'trial', 'show', 'reasonable', 'believe', 'effective', 'prevent', 'diagnose', 'treat', 'aside', 'fda', 'assessment', 'conclude', 'known', 'potential', 'benefit', 'pfizer', 'outweigh', 'known', 'potential_risk', 'matter', 'scenario', 'fda', 'decision', 'mean', 'pfizer', 'distribute', 'filipino', 'matter', 'week', 'health', 'pandemic', 'official', 'target', 'initial', 'rollout', 'end', 'february', 'reality', 'timeline', 'administration', 'actual', 'number', 'dose', 'arrive', 'remain', 'uncertain', 'government', 'yet', 'finalize', 'supply', 'deal', 'pfizer', 'read', 'duterte', 'govt', 'take', 'month', 'sign', 'deal', 'pfizer', 'say', 'company', 'commit', 'deliver', 'dose', 'excess', 'supply', 'unite', 'stare', 'country', 'secure', 'order', 'early', 'identify', 'february', 'rollout', 'greatly', 'depend', 'country', 'include', 'gavi', 'list', 'state', 'get', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'early', 'rollout', 'peg', 'come', 'month', 'galvez', 'say', 'government', 'submit', 'appeal', 'covax', 'january', 'include', 'country', 'give', 'share', 'dose', 'january', 'official', 'covax_facility', 'also', 'schedule', 'inspect', 'ultracold', 'chain', 'storage_facilitie', 'necessary', 'keep', 'pfizer', 'stable', 'part', 'assessment', 'country', 'ready', 'receive', 'aside', 'demonstrate', 'efficacy', 'pfizer', 'offer', 'boost', 'hope', 'tame', 'pandemic', 'preliminary', 'study', 'show', 'likely', 'remain', 'effective', 'mutation', 'fda', 'decision', 'come', 'day', 'pfizer', 'official', 'file', 'application', 'agency', 'pfizer', 'first', 'apply', 'follow', 'british', 'drug', 'maker', 'astrazeneca', 'worth', 'note', 'first', 'batch', 'pfizer', 'arrive', 'country', 'galvez', 'say', 'distribute', 'metro', 'cebu', 'city', 'davao_city', 'area', 'facility', 'keep', 'temperature', 'actual', 'distribution', 'also', 'complicated', 'health', 'expert', 'cite', 'necessary', 'preparation', 'handle', 'new', 'administer', 'patient', 'pfizer', 'official', 'early', 'explain', 'dose', 'last', 'month', 'ultra_low', 'temperature', 'freezer', 'store', 'day', 'thermal', 'shipper', 'company', 'design', 'day', 'normal_refrigerate', 'condition', 'pose', 'challenge', 'health', 'system', 'frontline', 'health', 'worker', 'area', 'report', 'high', 'incidence', 'case', 'prioritize', 'receive', 'initial', 'dose', 'fda', 'grant', 'pfizer', 'full', 'approval', 'secure', 'full', 'marketing', 'authority', 'necessary', 'commercialize', 'contingent', 'pfizer', 'commitment', 'finish', 'development', 'product', 'pfizer', 'november', 'pfizer', 'become', 'first', 'company', 'announce', 'result', 'show', 'effective', 'finding', 'shatter', 'expectation', 'develop', 'breakneck', 'speed', 'offer', 'hope', 'end', 'pandemic', 'sight', 'late', 'country', 'clear', 'united_kingdom', 'canada', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'singapore', 'germany', 'australia', 'israel', 'country', 'com']",0.9938,0.038,0.769,0.193,0.48259671179883956,Positive

Malacañang makes the announcement on President Duterte's preferred vaccine ahead of the Food and Drug Administration
Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical firm, has applied for Emergency Use Authorization for its COVID-19 vaccine, Malacañang said on Monday, March 1.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque made the announcement ahead of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the government agency that receives EUA applications and is in charge of processing them.
Initially, Roque had said that Sinopharm planned to submit an EUA ""within the day."" But in a matter of minutes, after checking messages on his mobile phone, the Duterte spokesman issued a new announcement.
""I stand corrected. It has been filed. They have already filed with the FDA an application for EUA for Sinopharm vaccine,"" he said from the Philippine General Hospital, where vaccinations of healthcare workers were underway using another Chinese vaccine, Sinovac's CoronaVac.
Yet FDA Director General Eric Domingo has said he is yet to see Sinopharm's EUA application. As of writing, the FDA itself is yet to confirm the Malacañang announcement.
Duterte's preferred vaccine
The Sinopharm vaccine is Duterte's preferred anti-COVID-19 jab, as announced previously by Malacañang.
Roque had even said Malacañang lawyers were studying if the compassionate special permit allowing Duterte's security aides, the Presidential Security Group, to use 10,000 Sinopharm vaccine shots could provide legal basis for the Chief Executive to get those shots as well.
As of Monday, Malacañang's legal staff have yet to make a decision on the matter, said Roque.
The Sinopharm vaccine is at the heart of a controversy on smuggled vaccines.
Former special envoy Ramon Tulfo Jr, some PSG personnel, a senator, Cabinet member, and other high-ranking government officials were able to get Sinopharm vaccines in violation of regulatory processes and ahead of healthcare workers.
Despite this, Malacañang and Duterte himself have not moved to hold these individuals accountable. The President even instructed PSG members not to cooperate in any investigations.
Critics have said the Palace's hands-off stance smacks of preferential treatment and disdain for processes and regulations other Filipinos must follow. (READ: Malacañang after Mon Tulfo illegal vaccination: He can do as he pleases)
Roque, on Monday, even said the PSG's illegal vaccinations in 2020 could be covered by the FDA special permit for 10,000 new Sinopharm vaccines, thus absolving the PSG of liability.
""In law, there could be instances when we ratify acts earlier done because of subsequent acts. But my initial legal opion is it could have the affect of ratifying something earlier,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
Yet FDA Director General Domingo had earlier stressed that the special permit is not retroactive and covers only the 10,000 Sinopharm vaccines yet to be delivered. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.9731000065803528,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['make', 'announcement', 'president', 'duterte', 'prefer', 'ahead', 'food', 'sinopharm', 'chinese', 'pharmaceutical_firm', 'apply', 'authorization', 'malacanang', 'say', 'march', 'presidential_spokesman', 'make', 'announcement', 'ahead', 'food', 'fda', 'government', 'agency', 'receive', 'application', 'charge', 'processing', 'initially', 'roque', 'say', 'sinopharm', 'plan', 'submit', 'day', 'matter', 'minute', 'check', 'message', 'mobile', 'phone', 'duterte', 'spokesman', 'issue', 'new', 'announcement', 'stand', 'correct', 'file', 'already', 'file', 'fda', 'application', 'say', 'vaccination', 'healthcare_worker', 'underway', 'use', 'chinese', 'yet', 'say', 'yet', 'see', 'sinopharm', 'application', 'write', 'yet', 'confirm', 'malacanang', 'announcement', 'duterte', 'prefer', 'sinopharm', 'duterte', 'prefer', 'anti', 'jab', 'announce', 'previously', 'roque', 'even', 'say', 'lawyer', 'study', 'compassionate', 'allow', 'duterte', 'security', 'aide', 'group', 'use', 'sinopharm', 'shot', 'provide', 'chief_executive', 'get', 'shot', 'well', 'monday', 'malacanang', 'legal', 'staff', 'yet', 'make', 'decision', 'matter', 'say', 'roque', 'heart', 'controversy', 'smuggle', 'vaccine', 'former', 'special', 'envoy', 'ramon', 'tulfo', 'psg', 'personnel', 'senator', 'cabinet', 'member', 'high', 'rank', 'government', 'official', 'get', 'vaccine', 'violation', 'regulatory', 'process', 'ahead', 'healthcare_worker', 'duterte', 'move', 'hold', 'individual', 'accountable', 'president', 'even', 'instruct', 'psg', 'member', 'cooperate', 'investigation', 'critic', 'say', 'palace', 'hand', 'stance', 'smack', 'preferential', 'treatment', 'disdain', 'process', 'regulation', 'filipino', 'follow', 'read', 'illegal', 'vaccination', 'please', 'roque', 'even', 'say', 'psg', 'illegal', 'vaccination', 'cover', 'new', 'sinopharm', 'vaccine', 'thus', 'absolve', 'psg', 'liability', 'law', 'instance', 'ratify', 'act', 'early', 'do', 'subsequent', 'act', 'initial', 'legal', 'opion', 'affect', 'ratify', 'early', 'say', 'duterte', 'spokesman', 'yet', 'early', 'stress', 'cover', 'sinopharm', 'vaccine', 'yet', 'deliver', 'com']",-0.5994,0.109,0.782,0.109,0.2918593073593073,Negative

The Duterte government starts its vaccination drive as vaccine hesitancy increases, experts warn of an uptick in cases, and vaccine supplies remain uncertain
Over a year since its first reported coronavirus case, the Philippines on Monday, March 1, will finally start rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, offering hope for a country among the hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia.The start of the Philippines’ vaccination campaign sets off an unprecedented effort to tame the global menace by inoculating at least 50 million people against a disease that has killed over 12,300 and made over 576,000 sick.But long-anticipated vaccinations face multiple uncertainties ahead as vaccine supplies and deliveries to the country remain erratic, and as experts warn of an uptick in cases amid the spread of a variant from the United Kingdom and discovery of a “mutation of concern” in Cebu City.Unknown curveballs
While the Philippines is launching its vaccine drive with 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac – a donation from the Chinese government, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III announced 525,600 AstraZeneca vaccine doses earlier scheduled to arrive on Monday will be delayed for ""about a week,” owing to a “global supply problem.’The delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines was welcome news after an initial batch of 117,000 Pfizer doses expected to arrive in the country in mid-February was stalled due to undone paperwork for an indemnification fund.
Aside from this, the timeline of the delivery of other COVID-19 vaccines eyed by the Duterte government, including those developed by Moderna, the Gamaleya Research Institute, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax remain unknown as the Philippines has not yet been able to sign supply deals pinning down a date for arrival.This comes as experts just last Saturday, February 27, warned of a “serious increase” in cases in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the country’s pandemic, and recent upticks in cases across several provinces in past weeks.In its latest report, the Octa Research Group on Saturday, February 27, said that the reproduction number (R) – the number of people that one COVID-19 positive case can infect – in the capital region climbed to 1.43 after managing to remain below 1 earlier in the month.""This is similar to the rate of increase observed in Cebu City, Mountain Province, and Benguet, where specimens of the SARS-CoV-2 variant were identified based on genome sequencing,"" it added.The increase in infections and the virus’ reproduction number pose a threat to vaccinations as experts warned rising cases would mean more Filipinos will need to be vaccinated against the disease faster.Vaccine hesitancy rising
Adding to hurdles, the arrival of vaccines comes as vaccine hesitancy increases across the Philippines, with about only 19% of Filipinos saying in a recent survey that they would be willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
The figure, released from a survey by the Octa Research Group, is lower than numbers in earlier surveys. Among these were surveys conducted by Pulse Asia which found 32% of Filipinos saying they were willing to get vaccinated if a COVID-19 shot were available in November to December of 2020.A Social Weather Stations survey conducted in September 2020 found 66% of Filipinos were willing to get vaccinated at the time.Health officials are currently targeting to vaccinate at least 50 million to 70 million Filipinos by the end of 2021 – just enough to reach the recommended 60% to 70% of the population that scientists estimated was needed to reach herd immunity against COVID-19. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.6046000123023987,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['duterte', 'government', 'start', 'vaccination', 'drive', 'hesitancy', 'increase', 'expert', 'warn', 'uptick', 'case', 'supply', 'remain', 'uncertain', 'year', 'first', 'report', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'march', 'finally', 'start', 'roll', 'vaccine', 'offer', 'hope', 'country', 'pandemic', 'start', 'vaccination', 'campaign', 'set', 'unprecedented', 'effort', 'tame', 'global', 'menace', 'inoculate', 'least', 'people', 'disease', 'kill', 'make', 'sick', 'long', 'anticipate', 'vaccination', 'face', 'multiple', 'uncertainty', 'ahead', 'supply', 'delivery', 'country', 'remain', 'erratic', 'expert', 'warn', 'uptick', 'case', 'spread', 'variant', 'united_kingdom', 'discovery', 'mutation', 'concern', 'cebu', 'city', 'unknown', 'curveball', 'launch', 'drive', 'dose', 'coronavac', 'donation', 'chinese', 'government', 'health', 'announce', 'astrazeneca', 'dose', 'early', 'schedule', 'arrive', 'monday', 'delay', 'week', 'owe', 'global', 'supply', 'problem', 'delivery', 'astrazeneca', 'vaccine', 'welcome', 'initial', 'batch', 'pfizer', 'dose', 'expect', 'arrive', 'country', 'stall', 'due', 'undone', 'paperwork', 'indemnification_fund', 'timeline', 'delivery', 'vaccine', 'eyed', 'duterte', 'government', 'include', 'develop', 'moderna', 'institute', 'novavax', 'remain', 'unknown', 'yet', 'able', 'sign', 'supply', 'deal', 'pin', 'date', 'arrival', 'come', 'expert', 'last', 'warn', 'serious', 'increase', 'case', 'metro', 'epicenter', 'country', 'pandemic', 'recent', 'uptick', 'case', 'several', 'province', 'week', 'late', 'report', 'group', 'say', 'reproduction', 'number', 'number', 'people', 'positive', 'case', 'infect', 'climb', 'manage', 'remain', 'early', 'month', 'similar', 'rate', 'increase', 'observe', 'cebu', 'city', 'mountain', 'province', 'benguet', 'specimen', 'variant', 'identify', 'base', 'genome', 'sequencing', 'add', 'increase', 'infection', 'virus', 'reproduction', 'number', 'pose', 'threat', 'vaccination', 'expert', 'warn', 'rise', 'case', 'mean', 'filipino', 'need', 'vaccinate', 'disease', 'fast', 'hesitancy', 'rise', 'add', 'hurdle', 'arrival', 'vaccine', 'come', 'hesitancy', 'increase', 'filipino', 'say', 'recent', 'survey', 'willing', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'figure', 'release', 'survey', 'group', 'low', 'number', 'early', 'survey', 'survey', 'conduct', 'pulse_asia', 'find', 'filipino', 'say', 'willing', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'shoot', 'available', 'station', 'survey_conducte', 'september', 'find', 'filipino', 'willing', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'time', 'health', 'official', 'currently', 'target', 'vaccinate', 'least', 'filipino', 'end', 'enough', 'reach', 'recommend', 'population', 'scientist', 'estimate', 'need', 'reach', 'herd_immunity', 'com']",-0.9042,0.145,0.751,0.104,0.4467546342546343,Negative

Dr Gerardo Legaspi, director of the Philippine General Hospital, is the first person to legally receive a COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines
After weeks of delay, the Philippines finally started its COVID-19 vaccination drive, among the last to do so in Southeast Asia.
Philippine General Hospital (PGH) Director Gerardo ""Dr Gap"" Legaspi was the first to roll up his sleeves as he received his shot of CoronaVac developed by Chinese company Sinovac.
Legaspi is also the first health worker in the country who received a legal COVID-19 vaccine following the unauthorized vaccination of several high-ranking government officials and close-in security personnel of President Rodrigo Duterte.
PGH nurse Chareluck Santos administered the vaccine shot to Legaspi.
Here's what we know about Legaspi:
Legaspi has been into active practice and teaching in neurosurgery for 25 years now.
In the Philippines, he pioneered awake craniotomy surgery, a brain surgery performed on patients who are awake.
His expertise includes treating aneurysms, arteriovenous malformation,brain tumors, congenital malformations of the brain and spinal cord, and skull base surgery.
He is the former president of the the ASEAN Neurosurgical Society and the Academy of Filipino Neurosurgeons Inc.
He has clinics in PGH, St Luke's Medical Center, and the Medical City.
He also works as a consultant in other government institutions as well, like Philippine Children's Medical Center, AFP Medical Center and Davao Regional Hospital in Tagum, Davao del Norte.
After Legaspi received the shot, Filipina actress Saab Magalona recalled how the doctor saved the life of her son after performing two brain surgeries.
Aside from Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo and health department adviser Dr Edsel Salvaña also received their first shot of the Sinovac vaccine.
The kickoff of the mass vaccination drive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, comes as health workers express reluctance to receive the Sinovac vaccine.
Domingo earlier said that CoronaVac's lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
FDA instead recommended its use to people aged 18 to 59 after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
The recommendation spurred days-long deliberations among experts belonging to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, who later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, reiterating it is safe and effective. – Rappler.com",Rappler,4.0,0.994700014591217,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['director_general', 'hospital', 'first', 'person', 'legally', 'receive', 'week', 'delay', 'finally', 'start', 'vaccination', 'drive', 'last', 'southeast_asia', 'pgh', 'director', 'gerardo', 'dr', 'gap', 'first', 'roll', 'sleeve', 'receive', 'shot', 'coronavac', 'develop', 'chinese', 'company', 'sinovac', 'also', 'first', 'health', 'worker', 'country', 'receive', 'legal', 'follow', 'unauthorized', 'vaccination', 'several', 'high', 'rank', 'government', 'official', 'close', 'security', 'personnel', 'duterte', 'pgh', 'nurse', 'chareluck', 'santo', 'administer', 'shot', 'legaspi', 'here', 'know', 'active', 'practice', 'teach', 'neurosurgery', 'year', 'pioneer', 'awake', 'craniotomy', 'surgery', 'brain', 'surgery', 'perform', 'patient', 'awake', 'expertise', 'include', 'treat', 'aneurysm', 'arteriovenous', 'malformation', 'brain', 'tumor', 'congenital', 'malformation', 'brain', 'spinal', 'cord', 'skull', 'base', 'surgery', 'former', 'president', 'asean', 'neurosurgical', 'society', 'academy', 'filipino', 'neurosurgeon', 'inc', 'clinic', 'pgh', 'medical', 'city', 'also', 'work', 'consultant', 'government', 'institution', 'well', 'children', 'afp', 'regional', 'hospital', 'receive', 'shot', 'filipina', 'actress', 'saab', 'magalona', 'recall', 'doctor', 'save', 'life', 'son', 'perform', 'brain', 'surgery', 'legaspi', 'food', 'fda', 'health', 'department', 'adviser', 'dr', 'edsel', 'also', 'receive', 'first', 'shot', 'sinovac', 'kickoff', 'mass', 'vaccination', 'drive', 'march', 'come', 'health', 'worker', 'express', 'reluctance', 'receive', 'sinovac', 'domingo', 'early', 'say', 'coronavac', 'low', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'lead', 'expert', 'recommend', 'use', 'priority', 'sector', 'brazil', 'trial', 'involve', 'health', 'worker', 'expose', 'instead', 'recommend', 'use', 'people', 'age', 'separate', 'phase', 'trial', 'indonesia', 'turkey', 'demonstrate', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'do', 'mostly', 'community', 'setting', 'health', 'worker', 'expose', 'recommendation', 'spur', 'day', 'long', 'deliberation', 'expert', 'belong', 'national', 'later', 'approve', 'use', 'health', 'worker', 'reiterate', 'safe', 'effective', 'com']",0.9246,0.055,0.826,0.119,0.3756521739130435,Positive
https://www.rappler.com/business/tycoons-philippines-chip-in-covid-19-vaccines,Philippines' richest chip in for COVID-19 vaccines,RALF RIVAS,2020-11-18 20:15:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
The Philippines' richest families move to get COVID-19 vaccines for the country, once available. Will the private sector do the heavy lifting once again?
The Philippines' richest families are chipping in to ensure the availability of around one to two million COVID-19 vaccines widely expected to hit markets by mid-2021.
National Task Force Against COVID-19 Chief Implementer Carlito Galvez Jr thanked Enrique Razon Jr, Lucio Tan, Ramon Ang, the Sy siblings, and Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion for placing orders for over one million vaccines through advance market commitments (AMCs) – a financing mechanism that basically assures funders of the vaccine once produced.
""Nagpapasalamat po tayo kay Enrique Razon na mayroon po rin siyang binigay na 300,000 doses. Ang BDO at saka po 'yung ibang mga Lucio Tan Group at saka San Miguel Corporation saka Go Negosyo, nakapag-raise na po sila ng more than one million. And hopefully, baka tataas pa 'yon ng one or two million doses,"" Galvez said in a briefing at Malacañang on Tuesday, November 17.
(We thank Enrique Razon, he will give 300,000 doses. BDO, the Lucio Tan Group, and San Miguel Corporation, and Go Negosyo as well, they were able to raise over one million [vaccines] and hopefully raise one to two million more doses.)
Galvez noted that the tycoons are set to donate 50% to 80% of what they are set to procure, while the rest will be given to their essential workers at no cost.
The private sector has played a big role in the Philippines' pandemic response. From donations of various goods, to testing employees and poor households, conglomerates have stepped in, as the government has drawn flak for how it is handling the crisis.
Private sector
Galvez's latest statements point to the private sector doing some heavy lifting once more – this time, in vaccinating the country's entire population of around 108 million, as President Rodrigo Duterte's economic team allotted a meager amount for the much-needed vaccine.
The proposed 2021 budget contains only P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement, with several lawmakers expressing dismay over the allocation.
The Department of Health (DOH) has estimated that it needs around P12.9 billion to meet the target of vaccinating at least 20% of the entire population for free. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)
The DOH earlier explained that the proposed budget was crafted before Duterte's directive to vaccinate the entire population, which is why only P2.5 billion was allocated for the COVID-19 vaccine.
Meanwhile, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III is targeting a P20-billion fund for the purchase of the coronavirus vaccine through a loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines.
Galvez likewise urged Duterte to enter into deals with the private sector for vaccine financing and procurement.
""We have also various modes of financing including private-public tripartite agreement without the cost [to] the government,"" Galvez said.
""So the private sector will finance it by buying directly [from] the vaccine company…with the regulation [by] the DOH…who will decide where the vaccine will be given.""
In the same briefing, Galvez recommended that the government enter into an AMC, with the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank to act as finance managers.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier recommended the creation of an executive order, which would allow the Food and Drug Administration to issue emergency use authorization to hasten procurement.
The Philippines is currently looking at 17 possible sources of vaccines from various countries.
Out of the 17, 9 are currently undergoing the 3rd phase of trials, with Pfizer and Moderna reporting promising results.
Galvez noted that trials will be conducted in the Philippines in December 2020 and January 2021. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.9107000231742859,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['rich', 'family', 'move', 'get', 'vaccine', 'country', 'available', 'heavy', 'lift', 'rich', 'family', 'chip', 'ensure', 'availability', 'vaccine', 'widely', 'expect', 'hit', 'market', 'mid', 'force', 'thank', 'tan', 'ramon', 'ang', 'sy', 'sibling', 'place', 'order', 'vaccine', 'advance_market', 'commitment', 'amcs', 'financing', 'mechanism', 'basically', 'assure', 'funder', 'produce', 'nagpapasalamat', 'po', 'tayo', 'na', 'mayroon', 'po', 'rin', 'siyang', 'na', 'dose', 'bdo', 'po', 'yung', 'ibang', 'mga', 'tan', 'group', 'san', 'miguel', 'corporation', 'saka', 'go', 'negosyo', 'nakapag', 'raise', 'na', 'po', 'hopefully', 'baka', 'yon', 'ng', 'dose', 'galvez', 'say', 'briefing', 'malacanang', 'tuesday', 'november', 'thank', 'give', 'dose', 'bdo', 'tan', 'group', 'san', 'miguel', 'corporation', 'go', 'negosyo', 'well', 'able', 'raise', 'vaccine', 'hopefully', 'raise', 'dose', 'galvez', 'note', 'tycoon', 'set', 'donate', 'set', 'procure', 'rest', 'give', 'essential', 'worker', 'cost', 'private_sector', 'play', 'big', 'role', 'pandemic', 'response', 'donation', 'various', 'good', 'test', 'employee', 'poor', 'household', 'conglomerate', 'step', 'government', 'draw', 'flak', 'handle', 'crisis', 'late', 'statement', 'point', 'private_sector', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'time', 'vaccinate', 'countrys', 'entire', 'population', 'president_rodrigo', 'duterte', 'economic', 'team', 'allot', 'meager', 'amount', 'much', 'need', 'propose', 'budget', 'contain', 'procurement', 'several', 'lawmaker', 'express', 'dismay', 'allocation', 'department', 'health', 'doh', 'estimate', 'need', 'meet', 'target', 'vaccinate', 'least', 'entire', 'population', 'free', 'read', 'doh', 'short', 'vaccine', 'doh', 'early', 'explain', 'propose', 'budget', 'craft', 'duterte', 'directive', 'vaccinate', 'entire', 'population', 'allocate', 'meanwhile', 'finance', 'target', 'fund', 'purchase', 'coronavirus', 'loan', 'galvez', 'likewise', 'urge', 'duterte', 'enter', 'deal', 'private_sector', 'financing', 'procurement', 'also', 'various', 'mode', 'financing', 'include', 'private', 'public', 'tripartite_agreement', 'cost', 'government', 'galvez', 'say', 'private_sector', 'finance', 'buy', 'directly', 'company', 'regulation', 'doh', 'decide', 'give', 'briefing', 'galvez', 'recommend', 'government', 'enter', 'amc', 'world', 'bank', 'asian_development', 'bank', 'act', 'finance', 'manager', 'health', 'early', 'recommend', 'creation', 'executive', 'order', 'allow', 'food', 'drug_administration', 'issue', 'authorization', 'hasten', 'procurement', 'currently', 'look', 'possible', 'source', 'vaccine', 'various', 'country', 'currently', 'undergo', 'rd', 'phase', 'trial', 'pfizer', 'moderna', 'report', 'promising', 'result', 'galvez', 'note', 'trial', 'conduct', 'com']",0.9531,0.077,0.772,0.151,0.46119047619047626,Positive

Government officials have so far failed to properly explain how the unregulated immunization efforts took place. – with reports from Mara Cepeda, Ryan Macasero, Pia Ranada, Bonz Magsambol, and Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com

‘We have been developing our own vaccine for the past 3 months,’ says Indonesian President Joko Widodo
No, they’re not just waiting for vaccines from China or Russia.
Unlike the Philippines, Indonesia is developing its own coronavirus vaccine, which the country expects to complete by mid-2021.
“We have been developing our own vaccine for the past 3 months, specifically from the COVID-19 virus strain spread in Indonesia. Hopefully the vaccine will be ready soon and it (vaccine development) is expected to be completed by mid-2021,” said Indonesian President Joko Widodo, as quoted by the Jakarta Post on Tuesday, August 11.
Jokowi was speaking at the launch of the vaccine’s late-stage human trials, the Jakarta Post said. The vaccine is being developed by the Indonesian state-owned enterprise Bio Farma in partnership with Sinovac Biotech of China.
“We are proud that a state-owned enterprise like Bio Farma in partnership with Sinovac Biotech of China are able to begin phase III clinical trials. Not many countries or institutions have been able to reach this stage,” said Indonesia’s State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir.
This is part of Indonesia’s long-term strategy to fight COVID-19, knowing it might be difficult to gain access to other countries’ vaccines.“Therefore, it is necessary for Indonesia to develop its own COVID-19 vaccine. And it will be by Indonesia, from Indonesia, to Indonesia,” said Ali Ghufron Mukti of Indonesia’s research and technology ministry, in another Jakarta Post report.
In contrast, the Philippines, which has invested little in scientific research through the years, concedes it has no means to produce its own vaccine. Instead it is banking on a short-term strategy of joining clinical trials of other countries – a move Indonesia is also taking.

Searching for a coronavirus vaccine: What PH clinical trials will look like
Even as vaccines are being developed in many other parts of the globe, President Rodrigo Duterte said he prefers to wait for vaccines from China and Russia. Duterte had begged China to prioritize the Philippines once a vaccine is available, while he was willing, in the words of German news outlet Deutsche Welle, to be Russia’s guinea pig once its vaccine is ready.
While they diverge on vaccine development, however, the Philippines and Indonesia have one thing in common: the two countries are Southeast Asia’s worst performers in fighting the coronavirus.The Philippines recently overtook Indonesia as the Southeast Asian country with the highest number of COVID-19 cases, but Duterte spokesman Harry Roque downplayed this development, claiming the Philippines has more cases because it conducts more coronavirus tests. – Rappler.com",Rappler,3.0,0.9955000281333923,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['develop', 'past', 'month', 'say', 'indonesian', 'president', 'wait', 'vaccine', 'china', 'russia', 'indonesia', 'develop', 'coronavirus', 'country', 'expect', 'complete', 'mid', 'develop', 'past', 'month', 'specifically', 'virus', 'strain', 'spread', 'indonesia', 'hopefully', 'ready', 'soon', 'development', 'expect', 'complete', 'mid', 'say', 'indonesian', 'president', 'quote', 'post', 'august', 'jokowi', 'speak', 'launch', 'late_stage', 'human', 'trial', 'post', 'say', 'develop', 'indonesian', 'enterprise', 'bio', 'farma', 'partnership', 'biotech', 'china', 'proud', 'enterprise', 'bio', 'farma', 'partnership', 'sinovac', 'biotech', 'china', 'able', 'begin', 'phase', 'many', 'country', 'institution', 'able', 'reach', 'stage', 'say', 'indonesia', 'state_owne', 'enterprise', 'minister', 'thohir', 'part', 'indonesia', 'long_term', 'strategy', 'fight', 'know', 'difficult', 'gain', 'access', 'country', 'vaccine', 'therefore', 'necessary', 'indonesia', 'develop', 'indonesia', 'say', 'indonesia', 'research', 'technology', 'ministry', 'post', 'report', 'contrast', 'invest', 'little', 'scientific', 'research', 'year', 'concede', 'mean', 'produce', 'instead', 'bank', 'short', 'term', 'strategy', 'join', 'clinical_trial', 'country', 'move', 'indonesia', 'also', 'take', 'must_read', 'search', 'coronavirus', 'clinical_trial', 'look', 'even', 'vaccine', 'develop', 'many', 'part', 'globe', 'duterte', 'say', 'prefer', 'wait', 'vaccine', 'china', 'russia', 'duterte', 'beg', 'china', 'prioritize', 'available', 'willing', 'word', 'german', 'outlet', 'russia', 'guinea', 'pig', 'ready', 'diverge', 'development', 'however', 'thing', 'common', 'country', 'bad', 'performer', 'fight', 'coronavirus', 'recently', 'overtake', 'indonesia', 'southeast_asian', 'country', 'high', 'number', 'case', 'duterte', 'roque', 'downplay', 'development', 'claim', 'case', 'conduct', 'coronavirus', 'test', 'com']",0.6597,0.063,0.843,0.095,0.4709294871794872,Positive

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III says the fund will be enough to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos. Is this enough to attain herd immunity?
The Philippines aims to come up with P73.2 billion ($1.5 billion) to pay for the COVID-19 vaccinations of 60 million Filipinos, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said in a meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, November 23.
""P73.2 billion financing that's pretty much – most of it is already fixed,"" he told Duterte and other Cabinet members who met in Davao City to discuss measures against the pandemic and other issues.
Dominguez spelled out the sources of this fund.
""Low cost, long-term"" loans from multilateral agencies like Asian Development Bank and World Bank - P40 billion
Domestic sources like LandBank, Development Bank of the Philippines, and government corporations - P20 billion
Bilateral sources from countries where a vaccine is being developed - P13.2 billion
The finance chief, however, tempered expectations, saying the P13.2 billion funds estimated to come from bilateral arrangements is ""not completely negotiated.""
$25 to vaccinate one Filipino
Dominguez estimated that it would cost an average of $25 or P1,200 to vaccinate one Filipino.
This would mean that with a P73.2 billion budget, the government will be able to pay for the vaccination of 60 million Filipinos or slightly less than 60% of the country's population.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III backed up Dominguez, saying this number of inoculated Filipinos is enough to achieve herd immunity, or the resistance of a community to a disease due to immunity of a high-proportion of its people.
""Herd immunity, Mr President, is anywhere from 60% to 70%, according to the World Health Organization. If we’re able to reach that, we’re going to pretty much arrest the spread of this and mawawala yung COVID-19 sa ating lipunan (and COVID-19 will disappear from our society),"" said Duque.
""So basically, 60 million [people] is okay and we have funds for that,"" said Dominguez in response.
Studies on vaccines say that the percentage of a population required to achieve herd immunity will largely depend on how effective the vaccine is.
In the same meeting, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said his strategy for distributing the vaccine would be to prioritize doses for coronavirus ""hotspots"" like Metro Manila, Davao City, Bacolod City, and others.
Then the vulnerable sectors in these cities or provinces would be given the vaccines first – poor households, health workers, military and police.
The proposed 2021 budget contains only P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement, disappointing several lawmakers.
The Department of Health has estimated that it needs around P12.9 billion to meet the target of vaccinating at least 20% of the entire population for free. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)
Status of vaccine negotiations
The government is already negotiating with 4 vaccine developers – Pfizer (US), AstraZeneca (United Kingdom), Sinovac (China), and Janssen (US), said Galvez.
By the end of November, the government will be able to provide its Advance Market Commitment to these firms to reserve a supply of their vaccine, he added.
Galvez was most optimistic about the arrangements for the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying the firm is setting aside 20 million doses for the Philippines and that it is the most affordable, costing ""more or less $5.""
If all goes goes smoothly, said Galvez, distribution of the 20 million doses in the Philippines may take place in the second quarter of 2021 or during the months of April to June. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.7975000143051147,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['finance', 'say', 'fund', 'enough', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'enough', 'attain', 'herd_immunity', 'aim', 'come', 'pay', 'vaccination', 'filipino', 'finance', 'say', 'meeting', 'duterte', 'november', 'financing', 's', 'pretty', 'much', 'already', 'fix', 'tell', 'duterte', 'cabinet_member', 'meet', 'davao_city', 'discuss', 'measure', 'pandemic', 'issue', 'dominguez', 'spell', 'source', 'fund', 'low', 'cost', 'long_term', 'loan', 'multilateral_agencie', 'bank', 'world', 'bank', 'domestic_source', 'landbank', 'government', 'corporation', 'bilateral', 'source', 'country', 'develop', 'finance', 'chief', 'however', 'temper', 'expectation', 'say', 'fund', 'estimate', 'come', 'bilateral', 'arrangement', 'completely', 'negotiate', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'dominguez', 'estimate', 'cost', 'average', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'mean', 'budget', 'government', 'able', 'pay', 'vaccination', 'filipino', 'slightly', 'less', 'countrys', 'population', 'health', 'back', 'dominguez', 'say', 'number', 'inoculate', 'filipino', 'enough', 'immunity', 'resistance', 'community', 'disease', 'due', 'immunity', 'high', 'proportion', 'people', 'president', 'anywhere', 'accord', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'reach', 'go', 'pretty', 'much', 'arrest', 'spread', 'mawawala', 'yung', 'ate', 'disappear', 'society', 'say', 'duque', 'basically', 'people', 'okay', 'fund', 'say', 'dominguez', 'response', 'study', 'vaccine', 'percentage', 'population', 'require', 'immunity', 'largely', 'depend', 'effective', 'meeting', 'say', 'strategy', 'distributing', 'prioritize', 'dose', 'coronavirus', 'hotspot', 'metro', 'bacolod', 'city', 'other', 'vulnerable_sector', 'city', 'province', 'give', 'vaccine', 'first', 'poor', 'household', 'health', 'worker', 'military', 'police', 'propose', 'budget', 'contain', 'procurement', 'disappointing', 'several', 'lawmaker', 'department', 'health', 'estimate', 'need', 'meet', 'target', 'vaccinate', 'least', 'entire', 'population', 'free', 'read', 'doh', 'short', 'vaccine', 'status', 'negotiation', 'government', 'already', 'negotiate', 'developer', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'united_kingdom', 'sinovac', 'china', 'say', 'galvez', 'end', 'november', 'government', 'provide', 'advance_market', 'commitment', 'firm', 'reserve', 'supply', 'add', 'galvez', 'optimistic', 'arrangement', 'astrazeneca', 'say', 'firm', 'set', 'aside', 'dose', 'affordable', 'cost', 'less', 'go', 'go', 'smoothly', 'say', 'galvez', 'distribution', 'dose', 'take', 'place', 'month', 'june', 'com']",0.5719,0.072,0.841,0.087,0.43705266955266964,Positive

Until the ceremonial rollout of the country's first vaccines from Sinovac, health workers express reluctance to receive the shot, opting to wait for different vaccines to become available
After nearly 580,000 infections, over 12,300 lives lost, and a year into quarantine restrictions, the Philippines finally launched its vaccine drive against COVID-19 on Monday, March 1.The historic day, long anticipated by millions as the world receded into lockdown, marked a turning point in the Philippines’ fight against the pandemic.
Government officials who witnessed the arrival of 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines celebrated these as the first “doses of hope” – the moment bringing leaders close to tears, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said.But for most of the country, the delivery of the first COVID-19 vaccines was met with a mix of anxiety, anger, and a lack of enthusiasm as the public had been made to expect the arrival of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines perceived to be better options.At the Philippine General Hospital, where the President’s pandemic representatives gathered for a ceremonial vaccination on Monday, officials spent considerable time convincing health workers to receive the vaccine.“Huwag nating hintayin 'yung tinatawag na (Let’s not wait for the so-called) best vaccine. There is no such 'best vaccine' because the best vaccine is the one that is safe and efficient, and arrives earlier,” Galvez said.Manila Mayor Isko Moreno echoed the appeal, calling available vaccines an “answered prayer.”“Let me address those who are waiting – I will respect you, your beliefs, and your views but kung ako ay tatanungin ninyo…hinihikayat ko kayo, 'wag ninyo ipagpabukas, 'wag ninyo ipagbakasakali ang kaligtasan ninyo,” he said.(Let me address those who are waiting – I will respect you, your beliefs, and your views, but if you ask me, I’m urging you, don’t put off until tomorrow or leave your safety to chance.)Moreno added: “Remember, if not all of you, most of us, most of you prayed last year to have a vaccine. In God’s mercy, he heard us. I think doctors and scientists here will agree that to develop a vaccine takes so many years but God has so many ways to hear us and I think now it’s up to us to act.”MUST READ
Philippines begins legally rolling out first COVID-19 vaccines
Health workers' hurt
Until the day of the ceremonial rollout, health workers from hospitals taking part in the distribution opposed the injection of Sinovac on them, citing its lower efficacy of 50.4% from Phase 3 trials among health frontliners in Brazil.Hospital workers from the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) staged a protest during their lunch break expressing “exasperation” at the Duterte government’s “consistently inconsistent” pronouncements on the mass vaccination program.Health workers criticized the government for passing on the burden of encouraging public trust in vaccination, saying it was the government’s responsibility to provide the best vaccines and be transparent.
The vaccinations on March 1 were the first legal vaccinations in the country, following the inoculation of several officials and government workers with smuggled vaccines in 2020.“Many from our ranks have been infected and some died combating the deadly virus. Our health and lives are always at stake, it is just right and humane that we demand the free, safest, and most efficacious vaccine,” said Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the LCP employees association-Alliance of Health Workers.At PGH, workers also called on the government to deliver the “best” vaccine to health workers. The hospital, among the few COVID-19 designated centers, reported a marked drop in willingness of its employees to get vaccinated days before the start of the rollout.PGH Director Gerardo Legaspi said that over 90% of the hospitals’ workforce had earlier said they were willing to get vaccinated, following the government’s announcement that health workers would receive Pfizer’s vaccine first.
The figure dropped to some 13% after officials said Sinovac would be offered instead, since paperwork on indemnity requirements stalled the delivery of Pfizer doses.Just days before the scheduled rollout, the PGH Physicians Association (PA) decried in a statement the PGH administration for not consulting them, when administrators said the hospital was ready to take “whatever vaccine becomes available.”VACCINATION STARTS.

The physicians urged leaders to wait for the assessment of the country’s Health Technology Assessment Council which reviews the “ethical, legal, social and health system implications” of medical technologies like vaccines, saying this would aid each worker to make a better-informed decision on whether or not to receive Sinovac’s CoronaVac.“The PGH PA stands firm that Sinovac, despite being the only vaccine available at hand should undergo appraisal by the HTAC…. PGH should uphold the ideals of ethical and evidence-based medicine, for which it is a bastion of,” the group said.More reluctance
Meanwhile, at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, health workers were likewise reluctant to receive the Sinovac vaccine, preferring to wait for other vaccines to arrive.
Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, who received the Sinovac vaccine, only appealed to health workers to get themselves vaccinated.The FDA earlier granted Sinovac emergency authorization, but its experts did not recommend it for health workers exposed to COVID-19 since lower efficacy from trials in Brazil had led experts there to not recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
Experts belonging to the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, later approved the use of the vaccine for health workers, emphasizing that it is safe and effective. With doses limited and deliveries uncertain, health workers should be given the option to choose whether or not to get the Sinovac vaccine, they said.
“Consider yourselves and your personal situation and if you are ready, give your informed consent that you are willing to get vaccinated. Just don’t decide to not get vaccinated,” Domingo said in Filipino.MUST READ

Vaccinations a priority
The decision of health workers to receive a vaccine is made more difficult by the uncertainty of when succeeding vaccines will arrive. At least 525,600 AstraZeneca doses were expected on Monday, but this was delayed by about “a week,” owing to limited global supply.Despite government's vaccine campaign and promises that more shots would be available, there is no guarantee when this would happen.Galvez was scheduled to travel to India from March 9 to 12 to sign the Duterte government’s first supply agreements that would pin down a specific date for the delivery of AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines. Amid the muted response to the Sinovac vaccine, experts who anticipate a surge of new cases in Metro Manila in the coming weeks, said health workers should get vaccinated while the surge is still in its early stages.“Our healthcare workers in the region must seize this opportunity,” Octa Research said.The issue is further compounded by rising vaccine hesitancy, with a recent survey showing some 46% of Filipinos are still unwilling to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Former health secretary Manuel Dayrit said in an interview with CNN Philippines that his main concern is how fast vaccinations could continue. He pointed out that 500,000 Filipinos would need to be vaccinated daily to achieve government targets.
The more vaccines are delayed, the more impact this could have on health, rising hunger, and unemployment. While the Philippines was among countries hardest hit by the pandemic in Southeast Asia, it was the last in the region to receive COVID-19 vaccines after starting talks with vaccine firms only sometime in November 2020.
Delayed negotiations have narrowed down options for vaccines to be purchased as supplies fluctuate and remain scarce. Until then, Filipinos have no choice but to wait as officials continue to urge people to get themselves vaccinated. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.620199978351593,"say, vaccine, dose, government,

The Department of Health assures the public that Russia's COVID-19 vaccine will be subject to a rigorous review and regulatory protocols before possible use in the Philippines
Philippine officials are eyeing to participate in Phase 3 clinical trials for Russia's COVID-19 vaccine.
The vaccine was touted by Russian President Vladimir Putin as ""quite effective,"" but scientists worldwide have raised concerns over its safety.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Wednesday, August 12, that the Philippines' vaccine expert panel led by the Department of Science and Technology would meet with the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology within the day.
Gamaleya, part of Russia's health ministry, had developed the vaccine in coordination with the country's defense ministry.
""Ang pag-uusapan ngayon (What will be discussed) with the Department of Science and Technology is how we can possibly have the clinical trial here also in the Philippines,"" Vergeire told reporters in a briefing.
Why it matters
Talks on possible Phase 3 clinical trials come as scientists around the world are skeptical about Russia's claim that it has developed a COVID-19 vaccine proven to be both safe and effective.
Experts pointed to the lack of published and transparent scientific data on the vaccine's supposed efficacy.Questions over the vaccine called Sputnik V largely revolve around the rush to declare it ready for use despite the lack of Phase 3 testing. As the last stage in clinical trials, the step is crucial as it involves thousands of participants over several months to determine if a vaccine produces immunity as well as any significant side effects.
Among the experts who raised concerns over the vaccine was renowned US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci, who ""seriously doubts"" the Sputnik V vaccine meets these standards.""Having a vaccine…and proving that a vaccine is safe and effective are two different things,"" said Fauci in a National Geographic discussion moderated by ABC News' Deborah Roberts.""I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that,"" he added.The World Health Organization has also yet to give the vaccine its stamp of approval, which would require a ""rigorous review and assessment of all the required safety and efficacy data.""Balancing risks
Despite this, President Rodrigo Duterte said the Philippines is moving forward and discussing specifics such as the possible number of doses to be allocated for the country.
Vergeire, however, tempered expectations and sought to assure the public that vaccines to be used in the Philippines will still be subject to health safety and regulatory procedures.
""Even if it went through regulatory procedures in Russia, when it arrives in the Philippines, it will still go through our own procedures. It's different when it arrives here in the country,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.""This would be a critical study and review…so we are sure [of the vaccine]…. We'll study the dossier [on the vaccine] and review these allegations...and what the findings were during different phases of [clinical] trials,"" she added. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.35530000925064087,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['department', 'health', 'assure', 'public', 'russias', 'subject', 'rigorous', 'review', 'regulatory', 'protocol', 'possible', 'use', 'official', 'eye', 'participate', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'russias', 'tout', 'russian', 'president', 'vladimir', 'quite', 'effective', 'scientist', 'worldwide', 'raise', 'concern', 'safety', 'health', 'rosario_vergeire', 'say', 'lead', 'department', 'science', 'technology', 'meet', 'institute', 'epidemiology', 'microbiology', 'day', 'part', 'russias', 'health', 'ministry', 'develop', 'coordination', 'countrys', 'defense', 'ministry', 'ang', 'pag', 'uusapan', 'ngayon', 'discuss', 'department', 'science', 'technology', 'possibly', 'clinical', 'trial', 'also', 'vergeire', 'told_reporter', 'briefing', 'matter', 'talk', 'possible', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'come', 'scientist', 'world', 'skeptical', 'russias', 'claim', 'develop', 'prove', 'safe', 'effective', 'expert', 'point', 'lack', 'publish', 'transparent', 'scientific', 'datum', 'vaccine', 'suppose', 'efficacy', 'question', 'call', 'sputnik', 'largely', 'revolve', 'rush', 'declare', 'ready', 'use', 'lack', 'phase', 'test', 'last', 'stage', 'clinical_trial', 'step', 'crucial', 'involve', 'thousand', 'participant', 'several', 'month', 'determine', 'produce', 'immunity', 'well', 'significant', 'side_effect', 'expert', 'raise', 'concern', 'renowne', 'national', 'institute', 'allergy', 'infectious_disease', 'director', 'seriously', 'doubt', 'sputnik', 'meet', 'standard', 'prove', 'safe', 'effective', 'different', 'thing', 'say', 'fauci', 'national', 'geographic', 'discussion', 'moderate', 'abc', 'hope', 'russian', 'actually', 'definitively', 'prove', 'safe', 'effective', 'seriously', 'doubt', 've', 'do', 'add', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'also', 'yet', 'give', 'stamp', 'approval', 'require', 'rigorous', 'review', 'assessment', 'require', 'safety', 'efficacy', 'data', 'balancing', 'risk', 'say', 'move', 'forward', 'discuss', 'specific', 'possible', 'number', 'dose', 'allocate', 'country', 'vergeire', 'however', 'temper', 'expectation', 'seek', 'assure', 'public', 'vaccine', 'use', 'still', 'subject', 'health', 'safety', 'regulatory', 'procedure', 'even', 'go', 'regulatory', 'procedure', 'russia', 'arrive', 'still', 'go', 'procedure', 'different', 'arrive', 'country', 'say', 'mix', 'english', 'filipino', 'critical', 'study', 'review', 'sure', 'study', 'dossier', 'review', 'allegation', 'finding', 'different', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'add', 'com']",0.9773,0.102,0.703,0.195,0.517151675485009,Positive

The COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Sinovac, a Chinese pharmaceutical company, is among the first expected to arrive in the Philippines
Philippine vaccine czar and National Task Force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr said on Monday, December 14, that pandemic officials have asked Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac to deliver supplies of its COVID-19 vaccine to the country by March 2021.
The targeted date of arrival, if met, will make the vaccine among the first to arrive in the Philippines, where President Rodrigo Duterte has touted a vaccine as the “only solution” to the pandemic.“They (Sinovac) said they are very confident that they will have the sources in April but we are negotiating that March will be our target,” Galvez said during a press briefing in Malacañang on Monday.
Sinovac is currently among 4 vaccine candidates that are in advanced stages of negotiations with the Philippines. The company is also applying for Phase 3 clinical trials in the country, eyed to start some time in January 2021.Galvez said the Philippines told Sinovac officials it would need 25 million doses for next year, and that “substantial meetings” were being held with its representatives to finalize a deal.Galvez said negotiations were also being facilitated by Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian, who emphasized to Chinese vaccine manufacturers that the countrywas “in dire need of vaccines during the first quarter” of 2021.Apart from Sinovac, the government was also in talks with Sinopharm and CanSino Bilogics for its COVID-19 vaccine.MUST READ
PH to prioritize high-risk areas, sectors for COVID-19 vaccine rollout
Prioritizing the Philippines
During the briefing, Philippine Ambassador to China Jose Santiago Santa Romana said China’s offer to prioritize the Philippines in its distribution of a vaccine “still stands,” and has been reiterated by President Xi Jinping, Foreign Minister Wang Yi, and other Chinese officials in recent meetings.Regarding talks with Sinovac, Santa Romana said the company sought details on the Philippines’ process for procuring doses as well as its specific needs. Sinovac officials said the company was aiming to ramp up production to500 million doses within the next 12 months.“They are ready to supply but what is important is there are continuing talks…and so we hope the talks can advanced so the procurement and deployment can happen,” Santa Romana said.Santa Romana noted while initial talks were talking place, there was a need to finalize a deal as the Philippines was not the only priority country of China.“Other ASEAN countries are involved and there other countries in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America,” he said.Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque downplayed concerns China would use its vaccines to put pressure on the Philippines on issues like the South China Sea. Roque said the possibility of such happening “is almost nil.”
Santa Romana acknowledged that while China may be offering access to a vaccine as part of its campaign to improve Beijing’s standing in the world, making it a condition in geopolitics has not come up in discussions.
“I think the Chinese are very clear that when it comes to the Philippines, we put it on separate tracks. Where we have differences, we discuss it but if you’re going to use to press on the other, that is certainly not going to work under this administration,” he said.MUST READ

Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez says the companies are willing to set aside 4 to 25 million doses of their respective vaccines
Two more pharmaceutical companies are interested in supplying the Philippines COVID-19 vaccine by the latter half of 2021, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez said on Friday, December 18.Romualdez said US-based Moderna and Arcturus Therapeutics are willing to set aside between 4 to 25 million doses of their vaccines starting in the 3rd quarter of next year “should the Philippine government find their proposals willing.”
“We are hoping our government will consider the promising candidates of Moderna and Arcturus for inclusion in our country’s pool of anti-COVID vaccines,” he said.Moderna is already in the initial negotiation stages with the Philippine government for the possible purchase of its vaccines, while Arcturus has not yet been included in the country’s vaccine portfolio for either trials or procurement.More opportunities
Romualdez’s announcement provides the Philippines with an additional option for vaccines, on top of 22 other potential candidates.Rowena Guevara, Department of Science and Technology Undersecretary for research and development, said the government is interested in multiple vaccines to cover both the need to have different vaccine platforms and ensure adequate supply for the country.Guevara said different kinds of vaccines, such as those that use RNA, live attenuated, or vector vaccine platforms are needed to cater to different kinds of people who would receive the anti-COVID shot.“Right now we are more worried about the supply because if you look at the availability of these vaccines that are ready for 2021, it is not enough for the entire world population. We have to prioritize and to that effect, we need to make sure we can get as many vaccines as we can from all the types of platforms,"" she added.
A recent study published in the BMJ medical journal found that based on advance purchase commitments, high income countries already reserved over half of doses to be supplied by 13 leading manufacturers.“Even if all 13 of these vaccine manufacturers were to succeed in reaching their maximum production capacity, at least a fifth of the world’s population would not have access to vaccines until 2022,” it said. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.6682000160217285,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['ambassador', 'united_state', 'romualdez', 'say', 'company', 'will', 'set_aside', 'dose', 'respective', 'vaccine', 'pharmaceutical_companie', 'interested', 'supply', 'latter', 'half', 'ambassador', 'say', 'friday', 'romualdez', 'say', 'base', 'moderna', 'arcturus', 'therapeutic', 'willing', 'set_aside', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'start', 'government', 'find', 'proposal', 'willing', 'hope', 'government', 'consider', 'promise', 'candidate', 'moderna', 'arcturus', 'inclusion', 'country', 'pool', 'anti', 'vaccine', 'say', 'moderna', 'already', 'initial', 'negotiation', 'stage', 'government', 'possible', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'yet', 'include', 'country', 'portfolio', 'trial', 'procurement', 'opportunity', 'romualdez', 'announcement', 'provide', 'additional', 'option', 'vaccine', 'top', 'potential', 'candidate', 'rowena', 'guevara', 'department', 'science', 'technology', 'undersecretary', 'research', 'development', 'say', 'government', 'interest', 'multiple', 'vaccine', 'cover', 'need', 'different', 'platform', 'ensure', 'adequate', 'supply', 'country', 'guevara', 'say', 'different', 'kind', 'vaccine', 'use', 'rna', 'live', 'attenuate', 'vector', 'platform', 'need', 'cater', 'different', 'kind', 'people', 'receive', 'shoot', 'right', 'worry', 'supply', 'look', 'availability', 'vaccine', 'ready', 'enough', 'entire', 'world', 'population', 'prioritize', 'effect', 'get', 'many', 'vaccine', 'type', 'platform', 'add', 'recent', 'study', 'publish', 'find', 'base', 'advance', 'purchase', 'commitment', 'high', 'income_countrie', 'already', 'reserve', 'dose', 'supply', 'lead', 'manufacturer', 'even', 'manufacturer', 'succeed', 'reach', 'maximum', 'production', 'capacity', 'least', 'fifth', 'world', 'population', 'access', 'vaccine', 'say', 'com']",0.9806,0.04,0.753,0.207,0.5375255102040816,Positive

Vaccines from American vaccine makers will likely start to arrive no later than June, says Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez
The 20 million doses of Moderna COVID-19 vaccines could arrive in the Philippines as early as end of May or early June, according to Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez.
“We’re hoping that we will have the first deliveries by either end of May or early part of June. That's our target,” said Romualdez on Friday, March 5, during a Laging Handa virtual public briefing.
The Moderna doses will arrive in batches, added the Ambassador.
This timeline is earlier than the previously announced possible arrival of Moderna vaccines in the 3rd quarter of the year, the months of July to September.
The government, in partnership with the private sector, and financed by the World Bank, has signed an agreement with Moderna pharmaceutical firm to secure 20 million doses for the country which will be divided among private companies, national government, and local governments.
""Almost half of that will go to the private sector and their employees... and then the other half will go to our health workers and the rest of the Filipinos that will be receiving the Moderna through the LGUs and other entities in the Philippines,"" said the envoy.
Pfizer vaccines arriving in 'next couple of weeks'
Romualdez also gave updates on other vaccine deals that the country has with the COVAX Facility and other American pharmaceutical companies.
COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access or COVAX, is a global initiative whose objective is the equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. Spearheading this effort are Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and others.
The 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines, secured through the COVAX Facility, will arrive in the ""next couple of weeks,"" said Romualdez.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had earlier said he was expecting the Pfizer doses to reach the Philippines sometime in the 2nd quarter of the year.
According to Romualdez, the US has doubled up its production of the vaccines as per President Joe Biden’s goal to vaccinate all Americans by the end of May.
Romualdez expected the vaccines from the US to start arriving no later than June of this year all the way down to the 3rd and 4th quarter of this year.
Johnson and Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceuticals) has also committed to provide 6 million doses to the Philippines but has yet to give a definite date of the delivery because of the production priority in America.
""It can't be that only one country is COVID-free. It should be the whole world and they are aware of that and the fact that they are backing the WHO (World Health Organization) and also contributing to the COVAX Facility will give access to most countries, especially the Philippines,"" said Romualdez in a mix of English and Filipino.
Galvez is set to fly to India on March 9 to secure another deal with an American vaccine-maker, Novavax, from which the Philippines expected 30 million doses.
Romualdez said the Philippines was not being left behind by other countries in terms of vaccination rollout.“It takes time but we’re not far behind as people think. We are not far behind from many countries. Truth be told, we’re actually better off than many countries because technically we’re only [in] the first week of March when we’ve already started our vaccination program,” said the Ambassador.
The Philippines is actually one of the last countries in Southeast Asia to receive vaccines and begin administering shots to its citizens. This despite it being the country with the second highest tally of COVID-19 cases in the region. – Rappler.com

'Now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,' says Filipino nurse May Parsons, who has been working with the UK's National Health Service for 24 years
A Filipino nurse in the UK administered the world’s first approved and fully tested COVID-19 vaccine Tuesday, December 8, in what she described as a “historic day” showing “light at the end of the tunnel.”
Filipino nurse May Parsons delivered Pfizer-BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine to 90-year-old Margaret Keenan at a local hospital in Coventry. Keenan is the first person in world to get the vaccine, approved just a week ago in Britain.“I’m just glad that I’m able to play a part in this historic day,” Parsons said in a statement released by the UK’s National Health Service (NHS). “The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel.”
“I’m happy it’s happened and now I’ve done it and hopefully more people come along and do as I did, you know?” Keenan told CNN.The moment watched by the world was not lost on Parsons, who has worked with the NHS for 24 years.Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she encouraged the public to avail of the vaccine.
""It's important that we're making this as popular as can be for everyone to take,"" Parsons said.
The UK is the first country in the world to mount a mass vaccination campaign against COVID-19, with the elderly, vulnerable, and front line health workers among the first in line to receive the shot in the program.The historic moment, which came after an unprecedented worldwide sprint to produce a safe and effective vaccine, marked a milestone in the pandemic that has so far killed over 1.5 million people and sickened over 67 million.British Ambassador to the Philippines Daniel Pruce described Keenan’s experience as a “fantastic moment” as he recognized Parson's service at the NHS.“A fantastic moment! And great to see that the vaccine is administered by Nurse May Parsons from the Philippines – one of the many thousands of Filipino healthcare workers making such an enormous contribution to the NHS,” Pruce tweeted.UK State Minister Nigel Adams said the country was “proud” to have dedicated health workers like Parsons.
Parsons is among the nearly 20,000 Filipinos who make up the staff of the NHS, UK's healthcare system. Filipinos rank third following British and Indian staff.Filipino nurses have been recognized worldwide for their contribution to foreign health systems across Europe, the Middle East, and North America, among others.

(UPDATED) Soldiers who do not want to avail of vaccines from the national stockpile would have to pay for it themselves
The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) ordered all 150,000 of its soldiers and their dependents to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), AFP spokesman Major General Edgard Arevalo said in a press briefing on Thursday, February 25.
""Ang Sandatahang Lakas ng Pilipinas is not like any organization. Tayo po ay service-oriented organization. Tayo po ang inaasahan sa mararaming mabibigay na tungkulin tulad ng pagharap ng pandemya. Kaya hindi opsyon ang pag-ayaw,"" Arevalo said in an online briefing.
(The Armed Forces of the Philippines is not like any organization. We are a service-oriented organization. Many rely on us on numerous matters, including facing the pandemic. So, refusal is not an option.)
The AFP will subsidize their vaccination if the jabs are available from the national stockpile. The first batch of this will be the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines set to arrive on February 28. Some 100,000 doses were reserved for the military.
The military gets this big share from the first shipment despite being categorized as the 4th priority group for vaccinations, following frontline medical workers, senior citizens, and people with comorbidities.
If soldiers do not want to use the Sinovac vaccine, they would have to look for a vaccine and pay for it themselves. So far, this option is not possible as there are no commercially available vaccines in the country.
Asked if this means that soldiers have no choice but to take in the Sinovac vaccine, Arevalo said, ""That may be the case.""
On Thursday afternoon, however, the Department of Health announced the rollout of Sinovac was placed “on hold” as it has yet to get the recommendation and approval of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).
The AFP has an estimated 150,000 personnel. If they end up receiving 100,000 doses, that means 50,000 will get the required 2 doses. Arevalo said they will prioritize AFP members who are medical workers and frontliners.

'Wala pong pilian,' says Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque as the government announces that a Chinese vaccine could be the first to be rolled out to priority groups
Health workers, elderly, and indigent persons who refuse to be given the first COVID-19 vaccine to be offered to them by the government will lose their priority slot and wait for another vaccine along with the general population, said Malacañang on Monday, January 11.
The policy was explained by Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque after news broke that a Chinese vaccine could be the first to be given to priority groups as early as February, if regulatory agencies approve.
Roque said that those who reject an offered vaccine will be asked to sign a waiver signifying their refusal to get the free jabs.
""Wala pong pilian, wala kasing pilitan. Pero magsa-sign ka ng waiver na hindi ka nagpaturok,"" he said during a Palace press briefing.
(No choosing, because there's no forcing. But you'll sign a waiver that you decided not to get vaccinated.)
""At kung mayroon kang prayoridad, siyempre, mawawala 'yung prayoridad mo, sasama ka sa the rest of the taumbayan na naghihintay ng bakuna,"" he continued.
(And if you're in the priority groups, of course, your priority slot would be gone, you would have to join the rest of the population waiting for a vaccine.)
Roque said this policy is ""only right"" because the government won't be able to choose which COVID-19 vaccine will be immediately available to the Philippines since this is partly dependent on supplies of vaccine developers.
""We all have rights to good health, but you can't choose because so many Filipinos need to be vaccinated,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
This vaccine policy has yet to be formalized in a task force resolution, but Roque said officials have reached a ""consensus"" on it.
Order of vaccines arrival
The first batch of COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in the Philippines will likely be CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by Chinese firm Sinovac. An initial batch of 50,000 doses is expected to arrive in February, with batches arriving throughout the year until arrivals reach 25 million doses in December.
Because CoronaVac requires two doses, this amount is only good for 12.5 million Filipinos, roughly half of the 24.6 million Filipinos in the priority list of the government.
What could fill in the gap are the other vaccines the government is trying to secure but are set to arrive later in the year. The first batch of 30 million doses of Covovax, the vaccine of American firm Novavax, is expected to arrive around July to September. Around this time also, doses of AstraZeneca vaccines, secured by Philippine private firms and various local governments, are seen to arrive.
All of those vaccine rollouts will depend on the issuance of an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Without an EUA, none of the vaccines can be administered.
So far, only AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Russia's Gamaleya Institute – developer of the Sputnik V vaccine – have applied for an EUA.
Roque, however, said he expects Sinovac to submit its application in the next few days.
Trust in vaccines
Some Phase 3 trials of the Sinovac vaccine have shown an efficacy of 78%, a better rating than the AstraZeneca vaccine. But details from these trials remain unpublished at this time. (READ: [ANALYSIS] The Chinese COVID-19 vaccines, Sinopharm and Sinovac, are effective)
Since July, it's been used in China for vulnerable sectors. However, no stringent regulatory agency, like the World Health Organization, European Union, or United States agencies have approved this vaccine.
But countries where clinical trials were performed, like Indonesia, Turkey, and Brazil, are expected to issue emergency use approval soon.
Roque said the government would wait for the Philippine FDA to issue an EUA before administering Sinovac's vaccine to Filipinos. If the doses arrive in February without an EUA, the government would accept the doses but keep them until an EUA is issued. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.9972000122070312,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['wala', 'pong', 'pilian', 'say', 'harry_roque', 'government', 'announce', 'chinese', 'first', 'roll', 'priority_group', 'health', 'worker', 'elderly', 'indigent', 'person', 'refuse', 'give', 'first', 'offer', 'government', 'lose', 'priority', 'slot', 'wait', 'general', 'population', 'say', 'policy', 'explain', 'break', 'first', 'give', 'priority_group', 'early', 'february', 'regulatory', 'agency', 'approve', 'roque', 'say', 'reject', 'offer', 'ask', 'sign', 'waiver', 'signify', 'refusal', 'get', 'free', 'jab', 'wala', 'pong', 'pilian', 'wala', 'kasing', 'pilitan', 'pero', 'magsa', 'sign', 'ka', 'ng', 'waiver', 'hindi', 'ka', 'nagpaturok', 'say', 'palace', 'press_briefe', 'choose', 's', 'force', 'sign', 'waiver', 'decide', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'kung', 'mayroon', 'kang', 'prayoridad', 'yung', 'prayoridad', 'mo', 'sasama', 'sa', 'rest', 'taumbayan', 'na', 'ng', 'continue', 're', 'priority_group', 'course', 'priority', 'slot', 'go', 'join', 'rest', 'population', 'wait', 'roque', 'say', 'policy', 'right', 'government', 'nt', 'able', 'choose', 'immediately', 'available', 'partly', 'dependent', 'supply', 'developer', 'right', 'good', 'health', 'nt', 'choose', 'many', 'filipino', 'need', 'vaccinate', 'say', 'duterte', 'spokesman', 'policy', 'yet', 'formalize', 'resolution', 'roque', 'say', 'official', 'reach', 'consensus', 'order', 'vaccine', 'arrival', 'first', 'batch', 'vaccine', 'arrive', 'likely', 'coronavac', 'develop', 'chinese', 'firm', 'sinovac', 'initial', 'batch', 'dose', 'expect', 'arrive', 'february', 'batch', 'arrive', 'year', 'arrival', 'reach', 'dose', 'december', 'coronavac', 'require', 'dose', 'amount', 'good', 'filipino', 'roughly', 'filipino', 'government', 'fill', 'gap', 'vaccine', 'government', 'try', 'secure', 'set', 'arrive', 'later', 'year', 'first', 'batch', 'dose', 'covovax', 'american', 'firm', 'novavax', 'expect', 'arrive', 'september', 'time', 'also', 'dose', 'astrazeneca', 'vaccine', 'secure', 'private', 'firm', 'various', 'local_government', 'see', 'arrive', 'rollout', 'depend', 'issuance', 'food', 'fda', 'none', 'vaccine', 'administer', 'far', 'astrazeneca', 'pfizer', 'russias', 'gamaleya', 'institute', 'developer', 'sputnik', 'apply', 'roque', 'however', 'say', 'expect', 'sinovac', 'submit', 'application', 'next', 'day', 'trust', 'vaccine', 'phase', 'trial', 'sinovac', 'show', 'efficacy', 'well', 'rating', 'astrazeneca', 'detail', 'trial', 'remain', 'unpublished', 'time', 'read', 'analysis', 'chinese', 'vaccine', 'sinopharm', 'sinovac', 'effective', 'use', 'china', 'vulnerable_sector', 'however', 'stringent', 'regulatory', 'agency', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'united_state', 'agency', 'approve', 'country', 'clinical_trial', 'perform', 'indonesia', 'turkey', 'expect', 'issue', 'approval', 'soon', 'roque', 'say', 'government', 'wait', 'issue', 'administer', 'sinovac', 'filipino', 'dose', 'arrive', 'february', 'government', 'accept', 'dose', 'keep', 'issue', 'com']",0.9678,0.024,0.872,0.104,0.4102453102453103,Positive

Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo says company officials claimed they already had enough data for their candidate vaccine
COVID-19 vaccine developer AstraZeneca has withdrawn its application to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) confirmed on Friday, December 11.“They said they already have enough data,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said in a message to Rappler.Asked when the company stopped its application, Domingo said his staff informed of him of the development today.
AstraZeneca’s decision to withdraw its application comes just days after it secured the endorsement of the Philippines’ research ethics board, one of the requirements needed to conduct trials in the country. Last December 4, Dr Nina Gloriani, head of the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel, said the group was waiting for the company to respond to its comments before it decided whether to endorse its application to the FDA.
AstraZeneca, which developed its vaccine with the University of Oxford, became the first COVID-19 vaccine candidate to have efficacy results from phase 3 trials published in peer-reviewed journal The Lancet. Its study published earlier this week confirmed initial trial data that showed their vaccine was 70% effective in protecting against symptomatic COVID-19.
While the company pulled out is application, Domingo earlier said conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines is not a prerequisite for a vaccine to be registered for use in the country.The Philippines has so far secured from the company an initial 2.6 million doses for about 1.5 million Filipinos through an agreement with the Philippine government and private sector.The doses will be split in half between the government and businesses that chipped in for the P700-million deal.On top of this, Galvez said the firm would be setting aside 20 million doses for the Philippines, each priced at “more or less $5.”

Initial doses of Pfizer and Sinovac vaccines may arrive as early as February, when the Duterte government plans to start its mass immunization campaign against COVID-19
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said COVID-19 vaccines developed by United States drugmaker Pfizer, China's Sinovac, and the United Kingdom's AstraZeneca may be among the first to arrive in the Philippines.
Galvez identified the 3 vaccines based on the current status of negotiations that the government is holding with pharmaceutical companies and multilateral initiatives, including international group GAVI's COVAX facility.
The COVAX facility guarantees access to a portfolio of vaccines and doses for at least 20% of the population of participating countries. It is run by GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and the World Health Organization (WHO).
""The 3 vaccines that will arrive first either way – if we can negotiate an early rollout – first, Pfizer, second, Sinovac, and then AstraZeneca,"" Galvez said in a virtual briefing on Wednesday, January 13.He earlier announced that the Duterte government could begin distributing COVID-19 vaccines to the public as soon as February, when the first doses of either Sinovac or Pfizer's vaccine arrive.

Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine would come from GAVI's COVAX facility as its officials are finalizing deals to distribute around 30 billion doses of the vaccine to developing countries for an ""early rollout."" If the Philippines is among the countries where doses would be delivered, supplies may come as soon as February, WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said.
In the Philippines, Pfizer has applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) with the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is expected to announce its decision this week.Sinovac earlier told Philippine officials that an initial delivery of at least 50,000 doses could be delivered in February, though this would still depend on whether the company secures emergency approval from the FDA.
Galvez said the company is expected to submit an application for EUA within the next few days after it consolidates findings from Phase 3 clinical trials in Turkey and Brazil.

Best price for Filipinos?
During the briefing, Galvez also defended the government's negotiations after lawmakers questioned why Sinovac is among the vaccine brands favored for procurement despite its reportedly higher price compared to other brands.
Galvez said that during negotiations, price points being offered were much lower than market prices which are publicly available. He declined to divulge Sinovac's exact price as talks with the company are bound by confidentiality agreements until a deal is finalized.Instead, Galvez described Sinovac's price to be midrange, supposedly cheaper than those being offered by American pharmaceutical firms.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire also sought to assure the public that the government would not enter into deals disadvantageous to Filipinos.
""We won't enter into negotiations where the government will be shortchanged. As we've said, we have a portfolio of vaccines we are looking at and we're not considering just one vaccine,"" she said in Filipino.The Philippines has so far signed deals to purchase at least 30 to 40 million doses of Novavax's vaccine, which are expected to arrive in the 3rd quarter of 2021.

Term sheets allow for vaccine companies to lock in supplies and start preparations for logistical needs to manufacture and deliver doses, Galvez said.
A final supply deal still needs to be signed to secure the exact price and number of doses, while securing emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will likewise be necessary for any vaccine to be used in the Philippines.
Only Pfizer has so far secured an EUA in the country, while AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, and Sinovac have submitted applications for this requirement.

Moderna, Arcturus open to supplying COVID-19 vaccine doses to Philippines by mid-2021
Why it matters
If the Philippines can lock in at least 20 million doses of Moderna's vaccine, secured vaccine supplies for the Philippines may increase to about 92 million doses, making it possible for the government to reach the low end of its target to vaccinate at least 50 million Filipinos.Galvez earlier mentioned that port magnate Enrique Razon Jr expressed willingness to help secure doses of Moderna's vaccine for Filipinos.
Like Pfizer, Moderna announced promising results for its vaccine, saying it is almost 95% effective.

(3rd UPDATE) The private sector is still looking for more manufacturers to boost the Philippines' vaccine stockpile
Over 30 business leaders inked a deal with the Philippine government for 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, worth around P700 million, on Friday, November 27.
Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion led the signing ceremony, along with vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr and Lotis Ramin, country president of AstraZeneca Philippines.
Half of the vaccines, expected to arrive around the 2nd quarter of 2021, will be donated to the government, while the other half will be for employees in the private sector.
The private sector signatories are:
Mario Deriquito, BDO Foundation
Richard Sanz, Philippine Franchise Association
Michael Tan, Philippine National Bank
Manny Pangilinan, Metro Pacific Investments Corporation
Jhayner Bufi, LBC Express Holdings

Key to this agreement were the efforts of the embassy of the United Kingdom led by Ambassador Daniel Pruce. Galvez has been saying for days that he had been in talks with the embassy on vaccine supply.
Concepcion also attributed the deal's success to SM's Tessie Sy-Coson and BDO president and chief executive officer Nestor Tan.
He noted that Coson and Tan helped reach out to AstraZeneca. Concepcion likewise called several business leaders while the talks were ongoing.
""Two weeks of calling, I sound like a beggar calling for everybody. But it turned around and we have a lot of support from the private sector,"" Concepcion said.
He added that the private sector is looking for more sources of the vaccine aside from AstraZeneca, as the 2.6 million vaccines can only benefit up to 1.5 million people.
The vaccine is expected to cost around P500 or $10 for two doses.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is being developed with Oxford University in the UK.
The pharmaceutical firm has reported its vaccine is 70% effective against COVID-19. But experts have raised doubts after finding out that the second group of participants in the AstraZeneca trials were limited to people aged 55 and below, an age group with a lower risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms.
But it’s still a long way to go before the 2.6 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses are actually distributed to Filipinos.The vaccine will still have to pass the UK's regulatory process and get approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration. This critical approval could come as early as May to July 2021 or late next year, said Galvez.
Half to private sector
Christian Gonzalez of the Enrique Razon Jr-led International Container Terminals Services Incorporated (ICTSI), one of the private companies making the donation, said the ""vast majority"" of initial vaccine recipients will be ""government employees, frontline health workers, and other essential services workers"" as designated by the Department of Health.
ICTSI will use its share of the vaccine supply for its employees and those of the entire Razon Group, said Gonzalez.
But the firm will also devote some of its doses to employees of the Philippine Ports Authority, Bureau of Customs, and other essential port and logistics workers – frontliners who ""made the biggest impact, especially at the beginning of the pandemic,"" said Gonzalez.
The private sector has played a big role in the Philippines' pandemic response. From donations of various goods, to testing employees and poor households, conglomerates have stepped in, as the government has drawn flak for how it is handling the crisis.
'Affordable'
Galvez told President Rodrigo Duterte that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is the most affordable vaccine among those being negotiated for by the government, priced at around $5 per dose.
""At nakita natin ang AstraZeneca po maganda po dahil kasi non-profit po ang sa kanya at saka pinakamababa po ‘yung kanyang presyo, more or less $5 lang po,"" the vaccine czar said during the November 23 meeting.
(We can see that AstraZeneca is good because it's non-profit and it has the lowest price, more or less $5 only.)
Galvez praised AstraZeneca and the UK embassy for their ""goal of providing equitable access"" to the vaccine to developing countries like the Philippines.
Apart from AstraZeneca, Galvez has spoken of securing ""20 to 50 million doses"" of China's Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine.
The Philippines aims to inoculate 60 million to 70 million Filipinos within 3 to 5 years. Some 35 million will belong to the first batch of recipients, a mix of poor households, healthcare workers, and frontline personnel.
To purchase these vaccines, the government is targeting a budget of P73.2 billion. Galvez is batting for a P150-billion fund in the 2021 national budget to shoulder expenses for a cold chain storage system necessary to distributing the vaccines. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.7735999822616577,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['rd', 'update', 'private_sector', 'still', 'look', 'manufacturer', 'boost', 'stockpile', 'business', 'leader', 'ink', 'deal', 'government', 'dose', 'astrazenecas', 'worth', 'friday', 'november', 'presidential_adviser', 'go', 'negosyo', 'founder', 'lead', 'signing', 'ceremony', 'czar', 'ramin', 'country', 'president', 'astrazeneca', 'vaccine', 'expect', 'arrive', 'around', 'nd', 'quarter', 'donate', 'government', 'half', 'employee', 'private_sector', 'signatory', 'mario', 'deriquito', 'bdo', 'foundation', 'richard', 'sanz', 'franchise', 'association', 'tan', 'national', 'bank', 'manny', 'metro', 'pacific', 'investment', 'corporation', 'jhayner', 'bufi', 'express', 'holding', 'udenna', 'corporation', 'carmelo', 'bautista', 'gt', 'capital', 'holding', 'wilcon', 'depot', 'paolo', 'borromeo', 'health', 'aboitiz', 'foundation', 'ted', 'jr', 'penshoppe', 'gerardo', 'transmarine', 'carrier', 'marlon', 'rono', 'magsaysay', 'people', 'resource', 'yu', 'seaoil', 'ricardo', 'cuerva', 'nova', 'group', 'andrew', 'filinv', 'corporation', 'felcaster', 'manufacture', 'corazon', 'lim', 'mercury', 'drug', 'corporation', 'jose', 'antonio', 'century', 'property', 'group', 'henry', 'federation', 'filipino', 'chinese', 'chamber', 'commerce', 'industry', 'kenneth', 'bounty', 'fresh', 'ronald', 'mascarinas', 'bounty', 'agro', 'venture', 'raul', 'concepcion', 'concepcion', 'industrial', 'corporation', 'jose', 'maria', 'advani', 'federation', 'indian', 'chamber', 'commerce', 'edgar', 'doubledragon', 'property', 'merrymart', 'jerome', 'ong', 'cdo', 'foodsphere', 'erwin', 'go', 'gur', 'lavi', 'group', 'martin', 'yu', 'shopee', 'first', 'holding', 'corporation', 'suyen', 'corporation', 'key', 'agreement', 'effort', 'embassy', 'united_kingdom', 'lead', 'ambassador', 'pruce', 'galvez', 'say', 'day', 'talk', 'embassy', 'supply', 'concepcion', 'also', 'attribute', 'deal', 'success', 'sms', 'coson', 'bdo', 'president', 'chief_executive', 'officer', 'nestor', 'note', 'coson', 'help', 'reach', 'astrazeneca', 'concepcion', 'likewise', 'call', 'several', 'business', 'leader', 'talk', 'ongoing', 'week', 'call', 'sound', 'beggar', 'call', 'turn', 'lot', 'support', 'concepcion', 'say', 'add', 'private_sector', 'look', 'source', 'astrazeneca', 'vaccine', 'benefit', 'people', 'expect', 'cost', 'around', 'dose', 'astrazeneca', 'develop', 'oxford_university', 'report', 'effective', 'expert', 'raise', 'doubt', 'find', 'second', 'group', 'participant', 'astrazeneca', 'trial', 'limit', 'people', 'age', 'age', 'group', 'low', 'risk', 'develop', 'severe', 'symptom', 'still', 'long', 'way', 'go', 'astrazeneca', 'dose', 'actually', 'distribute', 'filipino', 'still', 'pass', 'uk', 'regulatory', 'process', 'get', 'approval', 'food', 'drug_administration', 'critical', 'approval', 'come', 'early', 'late', 'say', 'galvez', 'half', 'christian', 'lead', 'international', 'container', 'terminal', 'service', 'incorporate', 'ictsi', 'private', 'company', 'make', 'donation', 'say', 'vast', 'majority', 'initial', 'recipient', 'government', 'employee', 'frontline', 'health', 'worker', 'essential', 'service', 'worker', 'designate', 'department', 'health', 'ictsi', 'use', 'share', 'supply', 'employee', 'entire', 'group', 'say', 'firm', 'also', 'devote', 'dose', 'employee', 'port', 'authority', 'bureau', 'custom', 'essential', 'port', 'logistic', 'worker', 'frontliner', 'make', 'big', 'impact', 'especially', 'begin', 'pandemic', 'say', 'play', 'big', 'role', 'pandemic', 'response', 'donation', 'various', 'good', 'test', 'employee', 'poor', 'household', 'conglomerate', 'step', 'government', 'draw', 'flak', 'handle', 'crisis', 'affordable', 'galvez', 'tell', 'duterte', 'astrazeneca', 'oxford', 'affordable', 'negotiate', 'government', 'price', 'dose', 'nakita', 'natin', 'ang', 'astrazeneca', 'po', 'maganda', 'dahil', 'kasi', 'non', 'profit', 'po', 'ang', 'sa', 'kanya', 'saka', 'pinakamababa', 'po', 'yung', 'kanyang', 'presyo', 'less', 'czar', 'say', 'november', 'meeting', 'see', 'astrazeneca', 'good', 'non', 'profit', 'low', 'price', 'less', 'galvez', 'praise', 'astrazeneca', 'uk', 'embassy', 'goal', 'provide', 'equitable_access', 'develop', 'country', 'apart', 'astrazeneca', 'galvez', 'speak', 'secure', 'dose', 'china', 'sinovac', 'aim', 'inoculate', 'filipino', 'year', 'belong', 'first', 'batch', 'recipient', 'mix', 'poor', 'household', 'healthcare_worker', 'frontline', 'personnel', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'government', 'target', 'budget', 'galvez', 'bat', 'fund', 'national', 'budget', 'shoulder', 'expense', 'storage', 'system', 'necessary', 'distribute', 'vaccine', 'com']",0.9662,0.07,0.809,0.121,0.37642276422764226,Positive

'Once we have an emergency use authorization mechanism in place, the process will be faster,' says FDA Director General Eric Domingo
With President Rodrigo Duterte set to issue an emergency use authorization or EUA, coronavirus vaccines could arrive in the country before the second quarter of 2021.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo said during a virtual press briefing on Friday, November 20, that the EUA would hasten the government vaccine procurement plan.
In his reply to queries about the effect of an EUA, Doming said: ""Once we have an EUA mechanism in place. Once nakakuha na sila ng (they have the) EUA , for example in the US FDA, mas mapapabilis talaga ang proseso (the process will quicken). We’re able to look at the evaluation that are done by these mature and advanced regulatory agencies,"" Domingo said.
Malacañang said on Thursday, November 19, that Duterte already approved ""in principle"" the request of the health department for an EUA.
An EUA would speed up the processing time for approval of COVID-19 vaccines that would enter the country – from 6 months to 21 days.
It would be an order from the President to create an express lane that would skip the usual red tape and load of paperwork which bog down vaccine purchases.
Earlier, DOH assured the public that fast-tracking would not mean compromising on quality studies.
""We have the vaccine expert panel at the start, and the FDA would continuously monitor this technology kahit nabigyan na nila ng rehistro sa ating bansa (even though they are already registered in our country),"" said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire in a previous briefing.
In September, the FDA said that in a ""best case scenario,"" the earliest possible availability of a coronavirus vaccine in the Philippines would be by April 2021.
On Tuesday, November 17, Pfizer's Albert Bourla said that they were ""very close"" to applying for an emergency use approval for its COVID-19 vaccine after collecting safety data to submit to US regulators.
Moderna has previously said it expects to apply for an EUA by November 25.
The Philippines is currently looking at 17 possible sources of vaccines from various countries. Out of the 17, 9 are now undergoing the 3rd phase of trials, with Pfizer and Moderna reporting promising results, both with 95% efficacy in their phase 3 clinical trials results.
Malacañang announced that Duterte would allow the government to provide an advance payment to pharmaceutical companies developing a COVID-19 vaccine, reversing his previous rejection of the proposal. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.995199978351593,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['authorization', 'mechanism', 'place', 'process', 'fast', 'say', 'duterte', 'set', 'issue', 'authorization_eua', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'arrive', 'country', 'food', 'fda', 'say', 'briefing', 'november', 'hasten', 'government', 'procurement', 'plan', 'reply', 'query', 'effect', 'doming', 'say', 'eua', 'mechanism', 'place', 'ng', 'example', 'fda', 'talaga', 'ang', 'proseso', 'process', 'quicken', 'able', 'look', 'evaluation', 'do', 'mature', 'advanced', 'regulatory', 'agency', 'say', 'malacanang', 'say', 'thursday', 'november', 'duterte', 'already', 'approve', 'principle', 'request', 'health', 'department', 'speed', 'processing', 'time', 'approval', 'vaccine', 'enter', 'country', 'month', 'day', 'order', 'president', 'create', 'express', 'lane', 'skip', 'usual', 'red_tape', 'load', 'paperwork', 'bog', 'purchase', 'early', 'doh', 'assure', 'public', 'fast', 'tracking', 'mean', 'compromise', 'quality', 'study', 'start', 'continuously', 'monitor', 'technology', 'kahit', 'nabigyan', 'ng', 'sa', 'ate', 'bansa', 'even', 'already', 'register', 'country', 'say', 'health', 'rosario_vergeire', 'previous', 'briefing', 'september', 'say', 'scenario', 'early', 'possible', 'availability', 'coronavirus', 'tuesday', 'november', 'pfizer', 'albert', 'bourla', 'say', 'close', 'apply', 'approval', 'collect', 'safety', 'datum', 'submit', 'regulator', 'moderna', 'previously', 'say', 'expect', 'apply', 'november', 'currently', 'look', 'possible', 'source', 'vaccine', 'various', 'country', 'undergo', 'rd', 'phase', 'trial', 'pfizer', 'moderna', 'report', 'promising', 'result', 'efficacy', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'result', 'malacanang', 'announce', 'duterte', 'allow', 'government', 'provide', 'pharmaceutical_companie', 'develop', 'reverse', 'previous', 'rejection', 'proposal', 'com']",0.9468,0.019,0.858,0.124,0.4460648148148148,Positive

Malacañang says President Rodrigo Duterte is the 'best communication tool' to convince many Filipinos to get vaccinated
Malacañang said Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is willing to go first in line for a COVID-19 vaccine once it is approved for domestic use by the country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA), in order to convince more Filipinos to get immunized.
""Kung papayagan na po ng FDA, I think po mauuna ang Presidente and nag-volunteer naman po siya. In fact, gustong-gusto na niya,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Monday, December 7, during a press briefing.
(If the FDA will approve, I think the President would go first and he already volunteered. In fact, he really wants it.)
Roque called Duterte the ""best communication tool"" to convince more Filipinos to get vaccinated against COVID-19, amid fears of vaccination programs that grew partly because of the Dengvaxia controversy in 2017.
""Ang Presidente po, naku, hindi na makahintay. Gusto niyang talagang turukan na siya na mapakita sa buong bayan na ligtas at epektibo, ito po’y dumaan sa expert panel group ng pinakadalubhasang Pilipino,"" said the spokesman.
(The President can't wait. He really wants to get vaccinated to show the country that it is safe and effective, it went through a panel composed of Filipino experts.)
In August, Duterte said he was willing to get vaccinated, in public, against SARS-CoV-2 using the Russian-developed Sputnik V.
The FDA has yet to issue Emergency Use Approval (EUA) for any COVID-19 vaccine. But its director general, Eric Domingo, said the process could be as fast as 21 days once a vaccine manufacturer gets an EUA from its home country and submits complete data to the Philippine government.
Domingo's best-case scenario would be a Philippine EUA in January, which could mean distribution starting in March given the capacity of vaccine manufacturers to churn out doses for all the countries which reserved supply.
In the meantime, the national coronavirus task force has determined the 25 million Filipinos who will get vaccinated first. The list is led by medical frontliners and indigent senior citizens.

'VIP treatment'
Roque said the Palace ""welcomes"" the willingness of any other public official to get vaccinated upon issuance of an EUA. But the spokesman also expects criticism should government leaders get access to the vaccines first.
""It's a personal decision of our leaders but if that happens, the government will again be accused of prioritizing VIPs like what happened with the PCR test,"" said the Duterte spokesman.
Back in March, the early days of the pandemic, the Department of Health was criticized for supposedly prioritizing the early release of COVID-19 test results of senators, their spouses, celebrities, and other VIPs.

The Philippine Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday, January 31, welcomed the offer of the country's group of Catholic bishops to help in the coronavirus vaccination drive of the government, which is struggling to persuade many Filipinos to get the shots.
The Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) has offered to transform church facilities in the country into COVID-19 vaccination sites, and said its members were also willing to get vaccinated in public to help build confidence in the campaign.
""We are happy with the CBCP's offer,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said in a statement. ""Churches really can be alternative sites to areas that lack facility, especially those in hard-to-reach municipalities.""
The health department has acknowledged they face an uphill struggle to persuade many people to take the vaccine shots, on top of the logistical difficulties in reaching 2,000 inhabited islands with precarious health systems.
""We can offer our church facilities to help in this massive and complicated and very challenging program of vaccination,"" Archbishop Romulo Valles, CBCP president said on Thursday, January 28.

Galvez and Duque’s announcement did not make mention of a specific vaccine, though the officials earlier said COVAX had identified Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine would be supplied for the intended early rollout in low income countries.MUST READ
Pfizer, Sinovac, AstraZeneca vaccines may arrive first in Philippines – Galvez
Aside from this, it was not yet known exactly how many vaccine doses the Philippines will receive from COVAX and when in the first quarter of 2021 these would arrive.Pfizer is so far the only company to have secured emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration – a requirement that would allow its vaccine to be used on wider populations outside Phase 3 clinical trials.Among the first to receive vaccines will be frontline health workers in hospitals.
Preparations underway
On Wednesday, Duque and Galvez inspected public and private cold chain facilities to be used for the Duterte government’s COVID-10 vaccine program scheduled to start in February.“All of these preparations that we are undertaking are aimed at ensuring that the country is ready to receive, store, and mobilize the COVID-19 vaccines that will come from the COVAX Facility,” Duque said.(READ: EXPLAINERS: What to expect once COVID-19 vaccines arrive in the Philippines | How COVID-19 vaccines will get from warehouses to you)

Initial doses of the vaccines are expected to arrive as early as the 3rd quarter of 2021
Philippine vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr said that the government has signed two more agreements with pharmaceutical firms to secure at least 25 million more doses of coronavirus vaccines for Filipinos.Galvez gave the update during a virtual press briefing on Wednesday, February 17, as he flashed figures of vaccines eyed by the Philippine government for delivery in 2021. Among new agreements signed included those with Moderna for 20 million doses of its vaccine and Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica) for 5 million doses of its single-dose coronavirus shot.Galvez’s presentation indicated that term sheets with the American pharmaceutical firms had been signed and that these companies have committed to supply doses to the Philippines. Term sheets are the second to the last step in vaccine negotiations and were necessary for locking in logistics needed for production and delivery.Initial doses of Moderna and Johnson and Johnson’s vaccines were expected to arrive in the Philippines as early as the 3rd quarter of 2021, with additional supply slated for delivery in the 4th quarter.While the deals assure Filipinos access to limited global supply, a supply agreement will still need to be signed with these companies to facilitate actual purchase and payment, as well as set a definite date for delivery.
Both Moderna and Johnson and Johnson will also need to secure emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before it could be rolled out to the public.So far, the FDA has granted emergency use approval for Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s vaccine, though FDA Director General Eric Domingo said Moderna has expressed interest in applying for an EUA.
Johnson & Johnson is expected to start Phase 3 clinical trials of its vaccine in the Philippines in the coming weeks, after the FDA approved its application to hold late-stage trials in the country.SCREENSHOT FROM RTVM
Why it matters
With term sheets signed with Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, Galvez said the government has secured enough doses needed to vaccinate at least 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year.Aside from the two companies, the Philippines is also eyeing to purchase 25 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, while a tripartite agreement is being considered for 10 to 15 million doses of Gamaleya’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine.Prior to this, term sheets had been signed to secure 30 million doses of Novavax’ vaccine, 17 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine, and 25 million doses of Sinovac’s vaccine.On top of this, the Philippines is also expecting up to 44 million doses from the COVAX global facility.MUST READ
TIMELINE: The Philippines’ 2021 COVID-19 vaccine plan
Galvez earlier said the government is targeting to start the rollout of vaccines by February, though the lack of an indemnification program in the country has hindered the delivery of an initial 117,000 Pfizer vaccines from COVAX. Government lawyers have signed an indemnification agreement with the global vaccine facility to facilitate the delivery of vaccines which could be expected in the coming week, he added.Once vaccines arrive, health officials plan to vaccinate some 2 to 3 million people per week to reach its target of inoculating at least 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of 2021.The Philippines’ total vaccine orders are pegged at about 178 million, largely in anticipation of delays and other complications in scarce global supply. – Rappler.com

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire says that for now, they only have an 'indicative' schedule of the arrival of the vaccine doses
The Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday, February 10, that there is ""no confirmed date"" yet on the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines as the country prepares for its vaccination program.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing that what Gavi vaccine alliance COVAX facility told them was an ""indicative date"" or tentative schedule, which is the 2nd or 3rd week of February.
""The February 15 is an indicative date, when we say indicative date that is tentative schedule. No confirmed date yet on when are we going to start,"" she said in a mix of English and Filipino.
Vergeire issued the statement when asked about the arrival of the vaccines in the country so as not to give ""false hopes"" to Filipinos. She added that they will give the exact date of the start of the vaccination program once they get the confirmation of the vaccine arrival.
This comes after Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque announced that the government would be ready to start its vaccination program by February 15. He later clarified though that start of vaccination will still depend on the arrival of the vaccines from the COVAX facility.
Though they could not give the exact date of the vaccination program, the government – led by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez – on Tuesday held a simulation exercise of the vaccine arrival in the country, including the pickup of the vaccine supplies from the airport.Vergeire said the simulation was done to avoid vaccine wastage.
Meanwhile, the DOH said on Monday that that all vaccine operation centers in local government units located in Metro Manila, Central Visayas, and Davao should be fully activated by February 10.– Rappler.com

'Instead of aiming at the hoop, he scratched his balls so he dropped the ball even as time was running out,' says Senator Panfilo Lacson in a cryptic tweet
The Philippines would have been in line to receive 10 million doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine in January 2021, if Health Secretary Francisco Duque III had not “dropped the ball” on an arrangement passed onto him by other officials, said Senator Panfilo Lacson.
In a cryptic tweet on Thursday, December 17, Lacson shared what he called a “direct quote.”
“In July, we passed the ball to him. Instead of aiming at the hoop, he scratched his balls so he dropped the ball even as time was running out. Then, Singapore grabbed and shot the ball,” Lacson said.
The senator then capped off his tweet, “Now, they have the vaccines and we don’t.”
Rappler asked Lacson to clarify whom he was quoting in his tweet, but he has yet to reply to our query as of this posting.
However, the previous night, he sent reporters a message in which he mentioned Duque in relation to an earlier tweet by Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, who said someone had “dropped the ball” in making arrangements with Pfizer for the vaccines.

Locsin shares foiled plan to secure 10M Pfizer vaccine doses by January
Citing a phone conversation he had with Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel “Babe” Romualdez, Lacson said Locsin and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were already negotiating “as early as July,” as arranged by Romualdez.
“Thus, they could have secured the delivery of 10 million Pfizer vaccines as early as January next year, way ahead of Singapore, but for the indifference of Secretary Duque, who failed to work on the necessary documentary requirement namely, the Confidentiality Disclosure Agreement (CDA) as he should have done,” Lacson said.
Even Pfizer’s country representative had been following up on the CDA but to no avail, he added.
Lacson then lamented how many lives will have been saved if the Pfizer vaccines were made available to Filipinos by January 2021. Although Duque claimed ongoing talks between the pharmaceutical company and the government, Lacson said the Philippines already missed what would have been the early first salvo of deliveries of the vaccines.
If it is true that Duque “dropped the ball” in arrangements for the Pfizer vaccine, then he may be sued for “gross and inexcusable negligence under the anti-graft law,” said Senator Francis Pangilinan on Thursday.
The Senate Committee of the Whole is set to hold a legislative inquiry into the government’s plans on rolling out COVID-19 vaccines. Pangilinan said this will be crucial not only in checking the readiness of those plans, but also in ferreting out any attempts at overpricing.
“Millions of lives are at stake here,” Pangilinan said.
Duque on Wednesday denied he had been negligent in the matter, and said negotiations with Pfizer for the vaccines are still underway.
Peace Process Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr, the country’s COVID-19 vaccine czar and chief implementer of policies on the pandemic, earlier said Pfizer's vaccine may arrive in the Philippines by the 3rd quarter of 2021 at the earliest, along with the bulk of other vaccines eyed by the government.
The Chinese-made vaccine against the coronavirus, Sinovac, is expected to be the first to arrive in the Philippines in March, Galvez said on Monday. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.8235999941825867,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['instead', 'aim', 'hoop', 'scratch', 'ball', 'drop', 'ball', 'even', 'time', 'run', 'say', 'cryptic', 'tweet', 'line', 'receive', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'january', 'health', 'drop', 'ball', 'arrangement', 'pass', 'official', 'say', 'cryptic', 'tweet', 'thursday', 'share', 'call', 'direct', 'quote', 'pass', 'ball', 'instead', 'aim', 'hoop', 'scratch', 'ball', 'drop', 'ball', 'even', 'time', 'run', 'singapore', 'grab', 'shot', 'ball', 'lacson', 'say', 'senator', 'cap', 'tweet', 'vaccine', 'ask', 'lacson', 'clarify', 'quote', 'tweet', 'yet', 'reply', 'query', 'post', 'however', 'previous', 'night', 'send', 'reporter', 'message', 'mention', 'duque', 'relation', 'early', 'tweet', 'foreign', 'secretary_teodoro', 'locsin', 'say', 'drop', 'ball', 'make', 'arrangement', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'must_read', 'locsin', 'share', 'foil', 'plan', 'secure', 'pfizer', 'dose', 'january', 'cite', 'phone', 'conversation', 'ambassador', 'say', 'locsin', 'secretary', 'state', 'pompeo', 'already', 'negotiate', 'early', 'arrange', 'romualdez', 'thus', 'secure', 'delivery', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'early', 'january', 'way', 'ahead', 'singapore', 'indifference', 'secretary', 'duque', 'fail', 'work', 'necessary', 'documentary', 'requirement', 'namely', 'confidentiality_disclosure', 'agreement', 'do', 'lacson', 'say', 'even', 'pfizer', 'country', 'representative', 'follow', 'avail', 'add', 'lacson', 'lament', 'many', 'life', 'save', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'make', 'available', 'filipino', 'january', 'duque', 'claim', 'ongoing', 'talk', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'government', 'lacson', 'say', 'already', 'miss', 'early', 'first', 'salvo', 'delivery', 'vaccine', 'true', 'duque', 'drop', 'ball', 'arrangement', 'pfizer', 'sue', 'gross', 'inexcusable', 'negligence', 'anti', 'graft', 'law', 'say', 'thursday', 'whole', 'set', 'hold', 'legislative', 'inquiry', 'government', 'plan', 'roll', 'vaccine', 'pangilinan', 'say', 'crucial', 'checking', 'readiness', 'plan', 'also', 'ferret', 'attempt', 'overprice', 'million', 'life', 'stake', 'pangilinan', 'say', 'duque', 'wednesday', 'deny', 'negligent', 'matter', 'say', 'negotiation', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'still', 'underway', 'peace', 'process', 'country', 'czar', 'policy', 'pandemic', 'early', 'say', 'pfizer', 'arrive', 'early', 'bulk', 'vaccine', 'eyed', 'government', 'chinese', 'make', 'coronavirus', 'sinovac', 'expect', 'first', 'arrive', 'march', 'galvez', 'say', 'monday', 'com']",-0.1531,0.101,0.807,0.092,0.3742753623188406,Negative

(UPDATED) These vaccines will be the Philippines' very first batch of COVID-19 jabs
The first batch of Sinovac vaccines is scheduled to arrive in the Philippines on Sunday, February 28, announced Malacañang.
""We expect that the delivery will arrive on Sunday,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in Filipino on Thursday, February 25.
These vaccines will be the Philippines' very first batch of COVID-19 jabs. The country lags behind some of its Southeast Asian neighbors like Indonesia and Malaysia, who have kickstarted their vaccination drives.
Government officials will be physically welcoming the arrival of the much-awaited vaccines, added Roque.
A Sinovac executive, general manager Helen Yang, previously said that the first delivery involves 600,000 doses, all of which are donated. They will arrive all together in a military plane. Of this, 100,000 have been reserved for the military.
President Rodrigo Duterte had wanted to be present in the welcoming ceremony for the vaccines but his attendance is not yet confirmed.
In a statement posted on Facebook, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said the delivery of the Philippines' first COVID-19 doses is a testament to the “profound friendship and partnership” between Manila and Beijing.
“It is a fine tradition between China and the Philippines to help each other in trying times. A friend in need is a friend indeed.... I hope the vaccines will help kick off Philippines’ mass inoculation campaign to curb the pandemic and allow Filipinos’ life to return to normal at the earliest,” Huang said.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had previously said it would take ""2 to 3 days"" after the arrival of vaccines for the government to administer the first doses to priority Filipinos.
CoronaVac, Sinovac's vaccine, was approved for emergency use just last Monday, February 22, but government experts do not recommend its use for health workers, which had been identified as the first priority of the vaccination program.
But government experts are still in deliberations to finalize the guidelines for CoronaVac. Malacañang has said health workers can still get the Sinovac vaccine if they wanted because the Food and Drug Administration only recommends against it but does not prohibit such use.
Indonesia, Brazil, and Turkey have used CoronaVac for their health workers. – with a report from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.9262999892234802,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['update', 'vaccine', 'first', 'batch', 'jab', 'first', 'batch', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'schedule', 'arrive', 'announce', 'malacanang', 'expect', 'delivery', 'arrive', 'sunday', 'say', 'filipino', 'thursday', 'february', 'vaccine', 'first', 'batch', 'jab', 'country', 'lag', 'southeast_asian', 'neighbor', 'indonesia', 'malaysia', 'kickstarte', 'vaccination', 'drive', 'government', 'official', 'physically', 'welcome', 'arrival', 'much', 'await', 'vaccine', 'add', 'roque', 'sinovac', 'executive', 'general', 'manager', 'previously', 'say', 'first', 'delivery', 'involve', 'dose', 'donate', 'arrive', 'together', 'military', 'plane', 'reserve', 'military', 'duterte', 'want', 'present', 'welcoming', 'ceremony', 'vaccine', 'attendance', 'yet', 'confirm', 'statement', 'post', 'chinese', 'ambassador', 'say', 'delivery', 'first', 'dose', 'testament', 'profound', 'friendship', 'partnership', 'beijing', 'fine', 'tradition', 'china', 'help', 'try', 'time', 'friend', 'need', 'friend', 'indeed', 'hope', 'vaccine', 'help', 'kick', 'mass', 'inoculation', 'campaign', 'curb', 'pandemic', 'allow', 'filipino', 'life', 'return', 'normal', 'early', 'say', 'previously', 'say', 'take', 'day', 'arrival', 'vaccine', 'government', 'administer', 'first', 'dose', 'priority', 'filipino', 'sinovac', 'approve', 'last', 'monday', 'february', 'government', 'expert', 'recommend', 'use', 'health', 'worker', 'identify', 'first', 'priority', 'government', 'expert', 'still', 'deliberation', 'finalize', 'guideline', 'coronavac', 'malacanang', 'say', 'health', 'worker', 'still', 'get', 'sinovac', 'want', 'food', 'recommend', 'prohibit', 'use', 'indonesia', 'brazil', 'turkey', 'use', 'coronavac', 'health', 'worker', 'report', 'sofia', 'tomacruz', 'com']",0.9814,0.013,0.794,0.193,0.3325396825396825,Positive

The WHO-led COVAX Facility will provide 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and at least 5.5 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Philippines
At least 5.6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from two pharmaceutical companies are expected to arrive in the Philippines within the 1st quarter of 2021 through the global initiative COVAX.
These will ""jump-start the country's national vaccination program as part of the global efforts to stop the spread of [the] coronavirus,"" said vaccine czar and National Task Force Against COVID-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr in a statement on Sunday, January 31.
The COVAX Facility, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), will provide 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. ""These are expected to be delivered in mid-February and will cover the 1st quarter supply commitment,"" Galvez added.
The country will also receive 5,500,800 to 9,290,400 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. AstraZeneca is still waiting for emergency use listing from the WHO.
""The 'indicative' numbers of [AstraZeneca] doses reflect only the supply for the first two quarters of 2021. The initial delivery is scheduled by mid to late February as stated in the letter,"" Galvez said.
Aurélia Nguyen, managing director of the COVAX Facility, informed the Philippine government about these in a letter.
The government had received confirmation on January 20 that it would be among the countries included in the COVAX distribution of vaccines for an early rollout.
Galvez then noted that according to COVAX, ""the number of doses and the projected arrival of the vaccines are all indicative since it all depends on the global supply.""
""The vaccines under COVAX can now inoculate our healthcare workers, medical-related personnel, and other frontliners,"" he said.
The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration. (READ: EXPLAINERS: What to expect once COVID-19 vaccines arrive in the Philippines | How COVID-19 vaccines will get from warehouses to you)

Talks are also ongoing with microfinance institutions in order to revive the assistance to small to medium businesses
Over 200 Philippine companies have ""expressed their pledge and interest"" in buying doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British company AstraZeneca, according to Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion.
""This only means that the business community is very serious in ensuring that our economy will remain open while slowly ending this war,"" Concepcion said in a recent statement, adding that ""more than 200 companies already expressed their pledge and interest, and still counting.""
Concepcion said among them were:
Ayala Corporation - 400,000 doses
Palawan Pawnshop - 100,000 doses
Okada Manila - 40,000 doses
Uratex Philippines - 21,000 doses
Century Pacific Food - 20,000 doses
Unioil Petroleum Philippines, Inc - 20,000 doses
Golden Arches Development Corporation - 15,000 doses
Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. - 10,000 doses
Vaccination of each person takes two doses. Each dose of AstraZeneca is still at its base cost of $5, said Concepcion, or around P241.50.
In a first batch in November, over 30 business leaders signed a deal with the Philippine government for 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine worth around P700 million.
In that deal, half of the vaccines will be donated to the government and half will be for employees of the private sector. The vaccines of that first procurement are expected to arrive around the 2nd quarter of 2021.
AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with Oxford University in the United Kingdom, reports a 70% effectivity rate against COVID-19.However, experts have raised doubts with the vaccine because the second group of participants in the clinical trial were aged 55 and below, an age range said to be of lower risk to developing severe coronavirus symptoms.Concepcion said that they have been in talks with microfinance institutions (MFIs) to kickstart plans on procuring vaccine doses as well, in order to revive MFIs. Helping MFIs will revive the assistance to Micro, Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises or MSMEs.
""The more businesses involved in this project, the faster the ecosystem will be revived, thus, stimulating exchange. It is one answer to the question of how we get money flowing again – it will stop the bleeding,"" said Concepcion.
Concepcion said the private sector's effort is a complement to the government's effort.
""If the private sector will not help, the economy will remain restricted,"" said Concepcion.
The Duterte government has been under scrutiny for a slow-paced process in getting the Pfizer vaccine, with Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr saying ""somebody dropped the ball,"" alluding to embattled Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.

The scheduled delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines on March 1 'will be delayed for about a week'
Over half a million of vaccine doses from the global COVAX facility will not arrive as expected on Monday, March 1, due to a ""global supply problem,"" according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
In an interview with state-run PTV4 network on Sunday, February 28, Duque said the Philippine government received a notice from the World Health Organization that the delivery of 525,600 AstraZeneca vaccine doses will be delayed for ""about a week.""
""They encountered problems with supply, so it will be delayed for about a week,"" Duque said.
Why this matters
The first batch of vaccines from the COVAX global agreement could immunize over 250,000 Filipinos against the highly infectious and deadly coronavirus.
So far, the Philippines has only received a donation of 600,000 vaccine doses from China in the form of Sinovac vaccines on Sunday, February 28.
The postponement further delays the Philippines' national immunization plan.

(UPDATED) The interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group says health workers can still opt not to get the Sinovac vaccine
The Department of Health's (DOH) advisory group has approved the use of Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine for Philippine healthcare workers but said those who prefer another brand would not be penalized.
The interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) made the announcement in a virtual press briefing hosted by the DOH on Friday afternoon, February 26.
""Really, the Sinovac vaccine that we evaluated is safe for use for healthcare workers. We need to protect them. And since ito ang available ngayon e kailangan nating gamitin (this is what is available now, we need to use it),"" said Dr Maria Consorcia Quizon of NITAG.
Dr Edsel Salvana of the DOH technical advisory group (TAG) said that based on NITAG's studies, Sinovac's CoronaVac ""looks like it will save lives and so it is but right to offer to the people on the frontlines who have been saving lives.""
""If they don't think this is the right vaccine for them, we will not penalize them,"" Salvana added.
'Safe' to offer to health workers
Dr Ana Ong -Lim, also a member of TAG, said that the first batch of the vaccines that would arrive in the country would need to be allocated rationally because vaccine resource is ""very scarce.""
""After much deliberation, nakapagkasundaan ng NITAG at TAG na sulit pa rin na ito ayi-alok sa ating heath workers at mabigyan sila ng pagkakataon based on their own understanding sa mga ibibigay nating information kung gusto nila itong tanggapin or hindi,"" she said.
(After much deliberation, NITAG and TAG have agreed that these vaccine is still worth offering to our health workers and to give them the option to decide for themselves whether to accept it or not, based on their own understanding of the information that we will give them.)
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that they are still finalizing the list of hospitals that would receive the first batch of the vaccines but the ones to be prioritized are healthcare workers in COVID-19 dedicated hospitals.
The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and the Lung Center of the Philippines are among the known COVID-19 dedicated hospitals in the country.
On Friday, healthcare workers at PGH demanded free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines.
Malacañang welcomed the development. ""The Sinovac vaccine is expected to arrive on Sunday, February 28, and we are confident that many of our healthcare workers would get themselves inoculated to boost public confidence in our mass vaccination program against the coronavirus,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.
Sinovac’s CoronaVac will be the first batch of vaccines to arrive in the Philippines.
The Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Sinovac emergency use authorization but recommended against administering it to health workers with high exposure to the disease.FDA Director General Eric Domingo said its lower efficacy of 50.4% from trials in Brazil led experts not to recommend its use in the priority sector. The Brazil trials involved health workers exposed to COVID-19.
The agency instead recommended its use to people aged 18 to 59 after separate Phase 3 trials in Indonesia and Turkey demonstrated an efficacy of 65.3% to 91.2%. These trials were done mostly in community settings and not among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19.
The DOH said that a separate media briefing will be held to announce the kick off of the country's vaccination program.

Mayors get resourceful to lock in vaccine doses at a time when the national government scrambles to finalize deals for the country as a whole
Back-to-back announcements by cities in the Philippines about agreements inked with developers of COVID-19 vaccines have brought a glimmer of hope to many Filipinos weary of the pandemic.
Finally, there was something somewhat solid for Filipinos amid enviable news from other countries, where health workers and the elderly are already getting the sought-after jabs.
Many could not help but compare the speed by which cities signed deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca against the fact that the national government itself had yet to enter into any agreement. (LIST: Local governments' plans for COVID-19 vaccines)
""Many local government units opted to go on their own. They buy, because they have the money, and they chose their own vaccine,"" acknowledged President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday, January 13.
Before cities began signing their vaccine deals, the only other signed agreement to secure doses was initiated and financially backed by private corporations like Udenna Corporation, Aboitiz Foundation, BDO Foundation, and others.Though all these agreements could not have been signed without the participation of the national government, it was the efforts of mayors and corporate executives that catalyzed and quickly shepherded the process.
How did the mayors of several cities in Metro Manila and across the country secure these agreements? What can other mayors or governors learn from their experience?
Rappler reporters spoke with the following local officials to find out:
Mayor Rex Gatchalian of Valenzuela City
Mayor Francis Zamora of San Juan City
Mayor Joy Belmonte of Quezon City and Joseph Juico, co-chairperson of Quezon City's vaccine task force
Mayor Sara Duterte of Davao City
How their efforts began
Deals were finalized and signed in early January, but most mayors began initial efforts to scout for a vaccine supplier months before.
Mayor Duterte said she began sending unsolicited letters to various vaccine makers in October 2020.
Around this time, Quezon City had also begun scouting around, according to Juico. By late November, Quezon City had begun talks with vaccine developers and had asked national government agencies on how they could proceed, Mayor Belmonte said.
In these months, mayors were walking blind, with the national government not having cascaded any clear plan on coordination for vaccine procurement.
It was only in early November when vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr publicly presented an initial National Vaccine Roadmap, where the only mentioned involvement of the local governments would be in identifying recipients, distributing vaccines, and rolling out information campaigns.
But, by the end of that month, private firms managed to ink a deal with AstraZeneca for 3 million doses. The national government was part of the deal since AstraZeneca had told corporation executives it needed the government involved.It was also in November when firms like Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute began announcing efficacy rates from Phase III trials of their vaccines, creating excitement and then clamor from the public. A 70% efficacy rating was found for AstraZeneca’s vaccine in a study published on December 8.
So, without the national government’s hand, mayors moved independently to contact vaccine makers. Belmonte got a number of an AstraZeneca executive from private doctors. Mayor Duterte, in an October meeting with the British embassy on another matter, discussed vaccines and was told to write to AstraZeneca for access, a suggestion she took.
Duterte had also asked officials at the Chinese consulate in Davao City “for options,” which led them to put her in touch with Sinovac. In the same way, a United States embassy official sent her an email, asking if they could help the city, and she responded. The embassy then endorsed a meeting with US firm Johnson & Johnson, whose pharmaceutical company, Janssen, is slated to conduct vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines.
Matters speed up in January
As of late November and early December, mayors like Belmonte and Valenzuela’s Gatchalian had still been hesitant to sign anything solid or make any orders with vaccine firms.
For Belmonte, this was because they didn’t think it wise to finalize an order without the guidance of the Food and Drug Administration, the agency that would identify which vaccines could be administered and distributed in the country.
San Juan’s Zamora said he also wanted to keep their options open for the possibility of sourcing vaccines from other providers. He said he did not want to “over-order” either, as they anticipated the national government to allocate vaccines for them.
It was in early December when Galvez had meetings with Metro Manila mayors where he explained the national government’s vaccine plans.
According to Zamora, Galvez had given local government units (LGUs) the go signal to procure vaccines on their own as long as mayors would coordinate with the national government.
But, in Davao City, Mayor Sara, the President’s daughter, had not yet heard of any vaccine coordination plan from the national government.
On December 10, she said the national government should let LGUs access vaccine deals on their own.
“In my opinion, if they allow LGUs to move on their own to access vaccines approved by the national government, then the LGUs may be able to help the national government move the vaccines to a large segment of the population,” she said over Davao City Disaster Radio.

Senators urge gov't to allow LGUs, private sector to secure own vaccine deals
It was on December 15 when Quezon City was able to get in touch with AstraZeneca officials. The firm sent them the next day a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), which was reviewed by the city’s legal department then sent back to AstraZeneca on December 17, said Juico.
A few days before Christmas, December 22, city hall and AstraZeneca officials sat down for a meeting to discuss the vaccine.
After a lull due to the holidays, the United Kingdom regulatory agency (Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency) announced its emergency use approval for AstraZeneca’s vaccine on December 30.
When Juico called up AstraZeneca after the news, he was told things would have to move faster.
“That’s when they said we have to move quickly because it’s approved by the UK and they need to talk with Mayor because a certain number of doses is available for allocation for QC,” Juico said.
Belmonte swung into action, calling up Galvez on January 1 to get clearance from the national government.
“Secretary Galvez acted quickly. On the same day, he texted the parameters and then called Mayor to say the President has already agreed that LGUs can enter into tripartite agreements as long as national government takes the lead,” said Juico.
Valenzuela City and San Juan City had a similar experience, though they had reached out to AstraZeneca weeks after Quezon City.
From a wait-and-see stance in early December, things moved quickly once the cities had contacted AstraZeneca on the first week of January. The entire process, from first contact to signing of an agreement, took just one week, according to Zamora and Gatchalian.
What Gatchalian found helpful was how efficient AstraZeneca was, the guidance from the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, and the framework provided by the tripartite agreement.
Another reason why deals with AstraZeneca pushed through faster than the rest was because the firm had agreed to the tripartite agreement model with national government.
This type of agreement has proven crucial to locking in vaccine doses because it entails an assurance of payment and orders that the national government has been hesitant to make due to procurement laws.
For LGUs, engaging in a tripartite agreement also assures them that the deals they are signing comply with the national government’s guidelines, which have not been clear.
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque had said this about the first such tripartite deal, the one with private corporations. He said it was one way to reserve vaccines without fear of violating procurement regulations since it was another entity promising to pay for the supply.
The other work-around devised by Galvez was to use funding from the Asian Development Bank for advance orders since procurement laws don’t cover international aid. But for this funding to be released, the ADB requires that the vaccine to be procured must have approval from a mature regulatory agency.
What local governments commit to do in vaccine deals
According to the tripartite agreements, the local governments will take charge of the vaccines they order – from payment to administering doses to their citizens.
“They will buy, they will pay, they will pay for all the expenses, including delivery of vaccines, and they will also vaccinate their constituents in accordance with the National Vaccination Plan,” said Roque in a press briefing on Tuesday, January 12.
Roque had bared provisions in the agreements entered into by cities, AstraZeneca, and the national government during the briefing. One of these provisions says payments of local governments need not pass through the national government, but will go straight to AstraZeneca.
Local governments are also in charge of paying for and coordinating the delivery of the vaccines to their areas.
This level of involvement of local governments was nowhere to be found in Galvez’s initial November 3 vaccine plan.
It was later on, absent more concrete moves from the national government, when mayors “offered” this level of involvement.
“It was the LGUs who offered their help to the NTF (National Task Force), the national government, to buy vaccines for their constituents,” said Roque.
In meetings with Metro Manila mayors, Galvez had expressed gratitude to the local chiefs for their initiative.
How about LGUs without resources to secure vaccine doses?
The mayors of Metro Manila and other highly-urbanized cities like Davao City, Bacolod City, and Antipolo City have big budgets. Davao City is even led by the President’s daughter. But what of smaller or less influential cities or provinces?
Malacañang has given assurances that they won’t be left behind.
“No! Because the national government, the NTF, is prepared to buy for everyone,” said Roque in Filipino.
Finally, on Monday, January 11, the national government signed an agreement with US firm Novavax for 30 million doses of its vaccine. Soon after, it also signed a deal with China’s Sinovac for 25 million doses.
Yet all these agreements – whether signed by the national government, cities, or private firms – are hinged on the all-important emergency use approval by the FDA. Without this approval, the agreements can’t be implemented. So far, only the Pfizer vaccine has been granted emergency use approval.
In the coming months, all eyes will be on how well the Duterte administration coordinates with mayors and governors to ensure an efficient and equitable vaccine roll-out. – with reports from Rambo

https://www.rappler.com/nation/octa-research-filipinos-covid-19-vaccine-willingness-february-2021,46% of adult Filipinos still unwilling to get vaccinated vs COVID-19,SOFIA TOMACRUZ,2021-02-25 09:27:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
Only 19% of Filipinos say they are willing to have themselves vaccinated
While the Philippines awaits the arrival of coronavirus vaccines necessary to tame the pandemic, a survey of the Octa Research Group showed a great number of Filipinos are still unwilling to have themselves vaccinated against the disease.The survey, conducted from January 26 to February 1, 2021, showed that if a safe and effective vaccine were available during the polling period, the greatest number of respondents at 46% said, “I will not have myself vaccinated.”The survey released on Wednesday night, February 24, also found that only 19% of respondents said they would have themselves vaccinated, while 35% said ""can't say"" if they will have themselves vaccinated.The Octa team based findings on face-to-face interviews with 1,200 Filipinos aged 18 years old and above. It has a 95% confidence level with a ±3% margin of error.Safety top concern
Among those unwilling to get vaccinated, the survey found the respondents' top 3 reasons for refusing a vaccine were the following:“Not sure if it is safe” (73%)
“Not sure if vaccine is effective” (29%)
“A vaccine is not needed to combat COVID-19” (9%)Concern about the safety of a vaccine was higher in Mindanao (78%) and Balance Luzon (76%) compared to Metro Manila (69%) and the Visayas (64%). Along with this, concern about vaccine effectiveness was highest in the Visayas (46%), followed by Metro Manila (34%), Mindanao (27%), and Balance Luzon (21%).
Aside from this, 6% of survey respondents said they would not have themselves vaccinated as the vaccine “might not be free,” while another 6% said they would not get vaccinated because it “might be costly or expensive.”The survey found class D (74%) and E (73%) were more concerned with the safety of vaccines compared to class ABC (46%). It was the reverse for concern over efficacy of vaccines with class ABC (33%) reporting the highest concern about this as compared to class D (28%) and E (29%).For respondents who would reject a vaccine, disapproval was highest among class D, with 46% of the respondents saying they would not have themselves vaccinated. This was followed by class ABC at 45% and class E at 44%.Balance Luzon and the Visayas also recorded the highest percentage of those unwilling to get a vaccine at 47% each, followed by Metro Manila and Mindanao at 43% each.Vaccine acceptance was highest among class ABC and E (23% each), while class D was slightly lower at (18%).
Of the 35% of respondents undecided about the vaccine, uncertainty was highest in Balance Luzon (39%), while Metro Manila, the Visayas, and Mindanao were “almost at par” at 31%, 33%, and 32%, respectively. Among those undecided, 32% were from class ABC, 36% from class D, and 33% from class E.
Low trust in China vaccines
The Octa survey found only 1 in 10 or 15% Filipinos trusted vaccines coming from China, while 4 in 10 (41%) trusted those coming from the United States.In between these, 25% said they trusted vaccines coming from the United Kingdom, followed by 20% from Russia, and 17% if coming from India.The 5 countries cover a portfolio of at least 7 vaccine companies the Philippines has been in advanced negotiations with to purchase vaccines. This included Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Johnson & Johnson (Janssen Pharmaceutica), AstraZeneca, Sinovac, and the Gamaleya Research Institute.Why this matters
The number of respondents both unwilling and reluctant to receive a vaccine underscores the challenges health officials still need to confront in boosting demand for the highly scarce and coveted product.This comes on top of issues in vaccine acceptance in the Philippines, which took a hit after the Dengvaxia scandal in 2017 tanked immunization rates of public vaccination programs largely done among the indigent sector.The Philippines so far has been the last in the Southeast Asia region to start rolling out vaccines, after paperwork and limited global supply delayed the delivery of doses secured in negotiations that started only sometime in November 2020. – Rappler.com",Rappler,4.0,0.8507999777793884,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['filipino', 'willing', 'vaccinate', 'await', 'arrival', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'necessary', 'tame', 'pandemic', 'survey', 'group', 'show', 'great', 'number', 'filipino', 'still', 'unwilling', 'vaccinate', 'disease', 'survey_conducte', 'january', 'february', 'show', 'safe', 'effective', 'available', 'polling', 'period', 'great', 'number', 'respondent', 'say', 'vaccinate', 'survey', 'release', 'night', 'also', 'find', 'respondent', 'say', 'vaccinate', 'say', 'nt', 'vaccinate', 'octa', 'team', 'base', 'finding', 'face', 'face', 'interview', 'filipino', 'aged_year', 'old', 'confidence', 'level', 'margin', 'error', 'safety', 'top', 'concern', 'unwilling', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'survey', 'find', 'respondent', 'top', 'reason', 'refuse', 'follow', 'sure', 'safe', 'sure', 'effective', 'need', 'combat', 'concern', 'safety', 'high', 'mindanao', 'compare', 'metro', 'visayas', 'concern', 'effectiveness', 'high', 'visayas', 'follow', 'metro', 'mindanao', 'survey', 'respondent', 'say', 'vaccinate', 'free', 'say', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'costly', 'expensive', 'survey', 'find', 'class', 'concern', 'safety', 'vaccine', 'compare', 'reverse', 'concern', 'efficacy', 'vaccine', 'report', 'high', 'concern', 'compare', 'class', 'respondent', 'reject', 'disapproval', 'highest', 'class', 'respondent', 'say', 'vaccinate', 'follow', 'class', 'visayas', 'also', 'record', 'high', 'percentage', 'unwilling', 'get', 'follow', 'metro', 'mindanao', 'acceptance', 'high', 'class', 'slightly', 'low', 'respondent', 'undecided', 'uncertainty', 'high', 'metro', 'visayas', 'mindanao', 'almost', 'par', 'respectively', 'undecided', 'class', 'class', 'low', 'trust', 'china', 'vaccine', 'octa', 'survey', 'find', 'filipino', 'trust', 'vaccine', 'come', 'china', 'trust', 'come', 'united_state', 'say', 'trust', 'vaccine', 'come', 'united_kingdom', 'follow', 'russia', 'come', 'india', 'country', 'cover', 'portfolio', 'least', 'company', 'advance', 'negotiation', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'include', 'astrazeneca', 'sinovac', 'institute', 'matter', 'number', 'respondent', 'unwilling', 'reluctant', 'receive', 'underscore', 'challenge', 'health', 'official', 'still', 'need', 'confront', 'boost', 'demand', 'highly', 'scarce', 'coveted', 'product', 'come', 'top', 'issue', 'acceptance', 'take', 'hit', 'dengvaxia', 'scandal', 'tank', 'immunization', 'rate', 'public', 'vaccination', 'program', 'largely', 'do', 'indigent', 'sector', 'far', 'last', 'region', 'start', 'roll', 'vaccine', 'paperwork', 'limited', 'global', 'supply', 'delay', 'delivery', 'dose', 'secure', 'negotiation', 'start', 'sometime', 'november', 'com']",0.9924,0.105,0.643,0.252,0.5305190905190904,Positive

But the American firm will prioritize vaccine doses for the United States, which has paid almost $2 billion for 100 million doses, says Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez
Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez said American pharmaceutical company Pfizer will ensure supply for the Philippines of its COVID-19 vaccine after it is approved for distribution.
His assurance comes after Pfizer announced that its vaccine candidate proved 90% effective in an initial study of its Phase 3 clinical trials, a ray of hope for people all over the world weary of the ongoing pandemic.
""As long as they get approval and we tell them what we need, they're ready to supply it,"" said Romualdez on Monday, November 9. A video of his remarks were shown to the Malacañang Press Corps on Tuesday.
The Philippines and other countries, however, may have to wait a little longer as Pfizer is prioritizing the United States for its vaccine production this year.
""Of course, their production this year, the United States will go first because they need 100 million vaccine [doses],"" said Romualdez in Filipino.
The ambassador pegged the cost of the Pfizer vaccine at $5 a shot, or around P240 a shot.
The US government had ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine for $1.95 billion, which puts the price per dose at $19.50.
Pfizer, said Romualdez, was the first American pharmaceutical firm to get in touch with him. He had been contact with other companies like Moderna ""3 to 4 months ago"" and these talks were supposedly the fruit of discussions between Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last April.
When will it arrive in the Philippines?
Romualdez estimates that, if all is smooth-sailing, the Pfizer vaccine could get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration within the year and Philippine FDA approval early next year.
This could then mean an initial batch of the Pfizer vaccine arriving in the Philippines ""by early next year"" or ""first quarter"" of next year.
Romualdez said Pfizer has not asked for any ""downpayment"" but only a ""purchase order"" signifying the Philippine government's commitment to buy a certain amount of vaccine doses.
Another way a supply of the Pfizer vaccine could reach the country is through the Philippine private sector. Romualdez said Filipino businessmen have expressed willingness to pay for the vaccines so they can provide these to their employees.
Duterte's economic managers are targeting a fund of P20 billion to be used to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, likely from a variety of suppliers.
This fund will come from a loan to be provided by the Land Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines, two government financial institutions. The loan will be given to the Philippine International Trading Corp, which has been authorized to purchase vaccines for the government.
This fund is to shoulder only an ""initial"" batch of vaccines.
Apart from this, there's a P2.5-billion allocation for vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget.
The economic team will have to look for more funding sources after Duterte promised to shoulder the cost of vaccines for all 107 million Filipinos. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.7735000252723694,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['american', 'firm', 'prioritize', 'dose', 'pay', 'almost', 'dose', 'say', 'ambassador', 'romualdez', 'ambassador', 'say', 'american', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'pfizer', 'ensure', 'supply', 'approve', 'distribution', 'assurance', 'come', 'pfizer', 'announce', 'candidate', 'prove', 'effective', 'initial', 'study', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'ray', 'hope', 'people', 'world', 'weary', 'ongoing', 'pandemic', 'long', 'get', 'approval', 'tell', 'need', 're', 'ready', 'supply', 'say', 'romualdez', 'monday', 'video', 'remark', 'show', 'malacanang', 'press', 'corps', 'tuesday', 'country', 'however', 'wait', 'little', 'long', 'pfizer', 'prioritize', 'united_state', 'production', 'year', 'course', 'production', 'year', 'go', 'first', 'need', 'dose', 'say', 'romualdez', 'filipino', 'ambassador', 'peg', 'cost', 'pfizer', 'shoot', 'around', 'shoot', 'government', 'order', 'dose', 'put', 'price', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'say', 'romualdez', 'first', 'american', 'pharmaceutical_firm', 'get', 'touch', 'contact', 'company', 'moderna', 'month', 'ago', 'talk', 'supposedly', 'fruit', 'discussion', 'foreign', 'secretary_teodoro', 'locsin', 'jr', 'secretary', 'state', 'mike', 'pompeo', 'last', 'arrive', 'romualdez', 'estimate', 'smooth', 'sailing', 'pfizer', 'get', 'approval', 'food', 'year', 'fda', 'approval', 'early', 'mean', 'initial', 'batch', 'pfizer', 'arrive', 'early', 'first', 'quarter', 'romualdez', 'say', 'pfizer', 'ask', 'downpayment', 'purchase', 'order', 'signify', 'government', 'commitment', 'buy', 'certain', 'amount', 'dose', 'way', 'supply', 'pfizer', 'reach', 'country', 'romualdez', 'say', 'filipino', 'businessman', 'expressed_willingness', 'pay', 'vaccine', 'provide', 'employee', 'duterte', 'economic', 'manager', 'target', 'fund', 'use', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'likely', 'variety', 'supplier', 'fund', 'come', 'loan', 'provide', 'government', 'financial', 'institution', 'loan', 'give', 'international', 'trading', 'corp', 'authorize', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'government', 'fund', 'shoulder', 'initial', 'batch', 'vaccine', 'apart', 's', 'allocation', 'vaccine', 'propose', 'national', 'budget', 'economic', 'team', 'look', 'funding', 'source', 'promise', 'shoulder', 'cost', 'vaccine', 'filipino', 'com']",0.9648,0.041,0.828,0.131,0.29446649029982364,Positive

But Health Secretary Francisco Duque III says officials will respect whatever decision President Rodrigo Duterte makes
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said on Friday, January 22, that he and the rest of the government’s pandemic officials will try to convince President Rodrigo Duterte to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in public.Duque made the statement when Senator Nancy Binay raised the issue during the Senate’s third hearing into the Duterte government’s COVID-19 vaccine program, saying the act could boost public confidence in vaccination.
“Yes, Ma’am, we will try our best to convince the President to perhaps allow himself to be publicly vaccinated but we will respect his decision,” Duque said.MUST READ
Duterte wants to receive Sinovac vaccine shots 'in private'
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said that Duterte was willing to get vaccinated with Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine, but that he wanted this done away from the public eye.Only months ago, Duterte said he was willing to get vaccinated in public with Russia’s Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine. But Roque said Duterte now believed that public inoculation was not necessary, likening it to how British Royalty were vaccinated in private and informed the public after.""He said there's no need to make it public. He’s taking the route of the British sovereign, because Queen Elizabeth and her husband decided to make their vaccination a private affair,"" said Roque in Filipino.
Duterte's preference is in contrast with Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who was vaccinated with Sinovac's CoronaVac on live television last January 14.
Boosting demand
Throughout several Congressional hearings, lawmakers have raised concern over increasing vaccine hesitancy in the Philippines.A Pulse Asia survey conducted from November 23 to December 2, 2020 showed close to a majority of Filipinos or 47% are not willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 32% said they want to be immunized. The remaining 21% were still undecided.
The number of Filipinos willing to get vaccinated was lower than previous figures seen in a Social Weather Stations survey done in September 2020, where 66% said they were willing to receive a COVID-19 shot.A separate survey by the Octa Research Group also showed that 47% of respondents in Metro Manila, the epicenter of the pandemic in the Philippines, were still undecided on getting a COVID-19 vaccine.
Duque earlier said the DOH was tapping the expertise of advertising agencies and other ""champions"" across different sectors to boost confidence and demand for a coronavirus vaccine. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.8532999753952026,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['health', 'say', 'official', 'respect', 'decision', 'duterte', 'make', 'health', 'say', 'rest', 'government', 'pandemic', 'official', 'try', 'convince', 'duterte', 'receive', 'public', 'duque', 'make', 'statement', 'senator', 'raise', 'issue', 'senate', 'third', 'hearing', 'duterte', 'government', 'program', 'say', 'act', 'boost', 'public', 'confidence', 'vaccination', 'try', 'good', 'convince', 'president', 'perhaps', 'allow', 'publicly', 'vaccinate', 'respect', 'decision', 'duque', 'say', 'must_read', 'duterte', 'want', 'receive', 'sinovac', 'shot', 'private', 'presidential_spokesperson', 'early', 'say', 'duterte', 'willing', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'sinovac', 'want', 'do', 'away', 'public', 'eye', 'month', 'ago', 'duterte', 'say', 'willing', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'public', 'russia', 'sputnik', 'roque', 'say', 'duterte', 'believe', 'public', 'inoculation', 'necessary', 'liken', 'british', 'royalty', 'vaccinate', 'private', 'inform', 'public', 'say', 's', 'need', 'make', 'public', 'take', 'route', 'british', 'sovereign', 'queen', 'husband', 'decide', 'make', 'vaccination', 'private', 'affair', 'say', 'roque', 'filipino', 'duterte', 'preference', 'contrast', 'indonesian', 'president', 'vaccinate', 'live', 'television', 'last', 'january', 'boost', 'demand', 'several', 'congressional', 'hearing', 'lawmaker', 'raise', 'concern', 'increase', 'hesitancy', 'november', 'december', 'show', 'close', 'majority', 'filipino', 'willing', 'get', 'say', 'want', 'immunize', 'remain', 'still', 'undecided', 'number', 'filipino', 'willing', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'low', 'previous', 'figure', 'see', 'station', 'survey', 'do', 'september', 'say', 'willing', 'receive', 'shoot', 'separate', 'survey', 'group', 'also', 'show', 'respondent', 'metro', 'epicenter', 'pandemic', 'still', 'undecide', 'get', 'duque', 'early', 'say', 'doh', 'tap', 'expertise', 'advertising', 'agency', 'champion', 'different', 'sector', 'boost', 'confidence', 'demand', 'coronavirus', 'com']",0.9794,0.052,0.76,0.188,0.31867816091954027,Positive
https://www.rappler.com/nation/house-approves-indemnification-fund-covid-19-vaccines,House approves P500-M indemnification fund for COVID-19 vaccines,MARA CEPEDA,2021-02-22 19:07:00,"MANILA, PHILIPPINES
The arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines is delayed due to the missing indemnification fund
The House of Representatives passed a bill setting a P500 million indemnification fund to shoulder the medical costs of Filipinos should they experience “adverse effects” after getting vaccinated for the coronavirus.
A total of 225 legislators voted yes to pass House Bill (HB) No. 8648 or the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021 on 3rd and final reading on Monday, February 22, 4 days after President Rodrigo Duterte certified the measure as urgent.
No lawmakers voted against the bill, while 6 abstained from the vote.Duterte certifying HB 8648 as urgent allowed lawmakers to do away with the 3-day mandatory interval between its 2nd and 3rd reading approvals.
If passed into law, HB 8648 would create a COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund worth P500 million, which would augment the funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.
A claim for indemnification for serious adverse events must be filed within 5 years from the day of the person's COVID-19 vaccination.
The indemnification fund would be sourced from the 2021 national budget’s Contingent Fund, which are lump-sum appropriations that the government can tapped to finance unforeseen expenses.
The bill states the indemnity would be valid and available for release until it is fully expended or if the President terminates the program.
HB 8648's initial version did not contain a specific amount for the fund. But prior to the measure's 2nd reading approval on Monday, the plenary agreed to substitute HB 8648 with a new version that contains several amendments to include the P500-million indemnification fund and where it would be sourced.
The House plenary tackled other measures on the floor before approving HB 8648 on 3rd and final reading on Monday.
The Philippine government is on a race to create this indemnification fund since it is among the requirements to gain COVID-19 vaccine doses from pharmaceutical companies and the COVAX global facility.Under indemnification programs, governments agree that distributing entities will not be held liable for unexpected adverse events. This is a risk governments absorb during the pandemic when granting emergency use approval for COVID-19 vaccines.Philippine pandemic officials initially announced that COVID-19 vaccines would already arrive by mid-February, but later on said delivery would be delayed due to a lack of an indemnification fund.
The Duterte government was supposedly informed of the indemnification requirement only during the latter phase of vaccine negotiations.MUST READ
Here’s why COVID-19 vaccines haven’t arrived in the Philippines yet
HB 8648 would also grant immunity to public officials and employees, contractors, volunteers, and private sector representatives – including vaccine manufacturers – from claims arising from the vaccine program. But they would not have any immunity if the claims would arise from ""willful misconduct and gross negligence.""
The bill likewise creates a vaccine passport program to serve as a record of the COVID-19 vaccinations received by an individual.
The final version of HB 8648 approved by the House is now closer to the pending Senate version, but some provisions are still either conflicting or are missing from the other chamber's version.
This means both houses would have to convene a bicameral conference committee to thresh out the conflicting provisions before the final version of the bill can be sent to Malacañang for Duterte’s signature.The House or the Senate may also opt to just adopt the version of the other chamber to skip the bicam level.
Fast-tracking vaccine purchase
Apart from creating an indemnification fund, HB 8648 also aims to help expedite the Duterte government’s COVID-19 vaccine procurement by exempting the process from public bidding and granting tax exemptions on the vaccines, supplies, and equipment to be procured.
The bill authorizes the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to engage in ""negotiated procurement under emergency cases"" for the COVID-19 vaccines.
Negotiated procurement would allow the DOH and the NTF to directly negotiate a contract with a capable supplier to speed up the process.
Local government units (LGUs) and private entities would also be allowed to buy COVID-19 vaccines or accept them as donations – but only by signing a multiparty agreement with the national government and the manufacturer concerned. This is the current policy being implemented by the NTF.
LGUs would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines for up to 50% of their respective localities' population. But the bill said the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases may adjust this cap when there are enough supplies available. This power granted to LGUs would be valid retroactively starting from January 1, 2021.
The bill also mandates private companies that would be procuring COVID-19 vaccines to administer them for the ""sole and exclusive use of such companies."" This authority would apply retroactively starting November 1, 2020.
The bill likewise grants tax exemptions on the COVID-19 vaccines to be procured.It would also waive the Phase IV clinical trial requirement for COVID-19 medication and vaccines, but the drugs should still be recommended by the World Health Organization and/or other internationally recognized health agencies.Under the bill's multiparty deal scheme, LGUs and private entities would only be allowed to purchase COVID-19 vaccines that have already been registered with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been issued emergency use authorization (EUA).
So far, only the vaccines created by Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca have secured EUAs from the FDA.If passed into law, the bill's provisions would be valid during the state of calamity and public health emergency that was declared due to COVID-19 or until June 30, 2022 – unless Duterte lifts the state of emergency or extends it. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.9552000164985657,"say, vaccine,

FDA Director General Eric Domingo says the agency is waiting for lacking documents before it could move on with further reviews
The Food and Drug Adminisitration on Friday, January 8, said it has received an application for emergency use authorization of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute.
In an official statement, the FDA said it received the application for an emergency use authorization (EUA) on Thursday, January 7, one day after the firm expressed interest to secure one.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the submission had been pre-assessed and that its applicant was “instructed to comply with lacking documents.”
Domingo told Rappler that the 21-day period to review Gamaleya's EUA application will not start until it submits all necessary documentary requirements.
Gamaleya earlier eyed Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines, and sent a partial submission for these efforts last December 17.
Earlier on Friday, Department of Science and Technology Undersecretary for Rowena Guevara said Gamaleya informed the Philippines’ vaccine expert panel last January 6, that it would no longer pursue trials and instead opt to secure an EUA.Gamaleya’s decision to apply for emergency approval, should it be granted, would bring its vaccine to a larger number of people as opposed to clinical trials where only a set number of individuals who volunteer to participate will receive it.FDA-issued EUAs are a necessary requirement for any vaccine to be used in the Philippines. The institute’s Sputnik V vaccine has obtained emergency approval from Russia, Argentina, and Belarus.The firm earlier announced that its vaccine had an efficacy rate of 91.4%, though it has not published its full findings in a scientific journal.MUST READ

Dr Jonas del Rosario himself contracted COVID-19 and lost his parents to the disease
A doctor and spokesman for the Philippine General Hospital (PGH), the top COVID-19 referral hospital of pandemic epicenter Metro Manila, will be the first person to receive a vaccine through the government's vaccination program.
PGH director Dr Gerardo Legaspi announced this during a Malacañang press briefing on Thursday, February 11.
""We chose our spokesperson, Dr Jonas del Rosario, who since March 22 until today, has been speaking for us everyday,"" said Legaspi in Filipino.
Del Rosario himself contracted COVID-19 and lost both his parents to the respiratory disease.
""Mas maganda para sa mga tao na makita na ang mga taong nagbigay ng kanilang lakas at talino at naapektuhan ng COVID na pinakamatindi ay siya dapat ang mauna,"" said Legaspi to explain why PGH personnel had picked Del Rosario.
Del Rosario will be the first to get the vaccine because PGH has been identified as the hospital that will get the first batch of vaccines. (See the list of priority hospitals here.)
The PGH head said that for hospital doctors and personnel, getting a COVID-19 vaccine shot was a ""symbolic gesture of the final phase of their personal fight against COVID.""
Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque, referring to Del Rosario, said, ""You will be part of history as the first to be legally vaccinated with the anti-COVID-19 vaccine.""
But in the same press conference, Roque announced that the Food and Drug Administration has approved the restricted use by President Rodrigo Duterte’s security personnel of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines.
Malacañang has not disclosed details of this deal secured by the Presidential Security Group outside of the government’s official vaccination program. The official program puts military and uniformed personnel on the 5th tier of prioritization, after health frontliners, senior citizens, and persons with comorbidities.
Doctors, hospital workers 'excited' to get vaccinated
PGH doctors and staff are in a state of ""excitement"" over the prospect of getting their first vaccine shot this month, said Legaspi.
At the moment, however, there is no certainty which vaccine they will get. The 117,000 Pfizer vaccines that were supposed to arrive in mid-February will be delayed due to ""processing of documents"" with the COVAX Facility and World Health Organization, said testing czar Vince Dizon in the same press conference.
Despite this ""slight"" delay, the government still expects the Pfizer doses to start arriving within the month of February, said Dizon.
Meanwhile, some 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines are confirmed to arrive on February 23. These doses are a donation from the Chinese government, said Presidential Spokesman Harry Roque.
Still, Legaspi said he is confident that PGH doctors would be willing to take any vaccine as long as it had emergency use approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration.
The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines have this approval, but Sinovac so far does not. The Chinese firm applied for an EUA last January 13.
Around 93% of over 5,000 PGH health workers conveyed their wish to be vaccinated, based on a pre-registration survey conducted by the public hospital.
Legaspi said the PGH is ""ready"" for the vaccinations, saying the hospital had finished conducting simulation exercises for the transport and actual vaccination procedure. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.9965999722480774,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['contract', 'lose', 'parent', 'disease', 'doctor', 'spokesman', 'pgh', 'top', 'referral', 'hospital', 'pandemic', 'epicenter', 'metro', 'first', 'person', 'receive', 'government', 'pgh', 'director', 'announce', 'malacanang', 'press_briefe', 'thursday', 'choose', 'spokesperson', 'dr', 'del_rosario', 'march', 'today', 'speak', 'say', 'filipino', 'del_rosario', 'contract', 'lose', 'parent', 'respiratory', 'disease', 'mas', 'maganda', 'para', 'sa', 'mga', 'na', 'makita', 'ang', 'mga', 'taong', 'nagbigay', 'ng', 'naapektuhan', 'ng', 'siya', 'ang', 'mauna', 'say', 'legaspi', 'explain', 'pgh', 'personnel', 'pick', 'del_rosario', 'first', 'get', 'pgh', 'identify', 'hospital', 'get', 'first', 'batch', 'vaccine', 'see', 'list', 'priority', 'hospital', 'pgh', 'head', 'say', 'hospital', 'doctor', 'personnel', 'get', 'shoot', 'symbolic', 'gesture', 'final', 'phase', 'personal', 'fight', 'refer', 'del_rosario', 'say', 'part', 'history', 'first', 'legally', 'vaccinate', 'anti', 'roque', 'announce', 'food', 'approve', 'restrict', 'use', 'duterte', 'security', 'personnel', 'sinopharm', 'vaccine', 'malacanang', 'disclose', 'detail', 'deal', 'secure', 'presidential_security', 'group', 'outside', 'government', 'official', 'official', 'program', 'put', 'military', 'tier', 'prioritization', 'health', 'frontliner', 'senior_citizen', 'person', 'comorbiditie', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'worker', 'excited', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'pgh', 'doctor', 'staff', 'state', 'excitement', 'prospect', 'get', 'first', 'shot', 'month', 'say', 'moment', 'however', 'certainty', 'get', 'vaccine', 'suppose', 'arrive', 'mid_february', 'delay', 'due', 'processing', 'document', 'covax_facility', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'say', 'test', 'czar', 'slight', 'delay', 'government', 'still', 'expect', 'pfizer', 'dose', 'start', 'arrive', 'month', 'say', 'dizon', 'meanwhile', 'dose', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'confirm', 'arrive', 'february', 'dose', 'donation', 'chinese', 'government', 'say', 'still', 'say', 'confident', 'pgh', 'doctor', 'willing', 'take', 'long', 'approval', 'food', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'vaccine', 'approval', 'sinovac', 'far', 'chinese', 'firm', 'apply', 'last', 'january', 'pgh', 'health', 'worker', 'convey', 'wish', 'vaccinate', 'base', 'survey_conducted', 'public', 'hospital', 'legaspi', 'say', 'pgh', 'ready', 'vaccination', 'say', 'hospital', 'finish', 'conduct', 'simulation', 'exercise', 'transport', 'actual', 'vaccination', 'procedure', 'com']",0.8885,0.074,0.805,0.121,0.4009259259259259,Positive

While President Rodrigo Duterte stokes expectations of normalcy 'by December,' experts say even the arrival of a vaccine won't assure this immediately
An infectious disease expert working for the government estimates that the earliest time the Philippines would approve a COVID-19 vaccine for distribution is in the second quarter of 2021 or the months of April to June.
Dr Jaime Montoya, executive director of the Philippine Council for Health Research Development, said this projection takes into consideration the time it will take to conclude crucial Phase 3 trials and the approval process of food and drug administrations.
""My estimate is that it will be available in the Philippines, second quarter of next year,"" he said in a Rappler Talk interview on Friday, September 18.
Dr Melvin Sanicas, a Filipino vaccine expert based in Switzerland, said Montoya's estimate is ""reasonable"" but that it's a ""best-case scenario.""
Montoya's estimated timeline is broken down as follows:
November or December 2020 - Earliest conclusion of Phase 3 trials of any of the 9 most advanced vaccine candidates
January to March 2021 - Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) of the countries where the vaccine candidates are developed approve the vaccine for distribution, based on their assessment of Phase 3 trials.
April to June 2021 - The Philippines' FDA approves a vaccine for local distribution.
This timeline is hinged on many things going right.
The assumption is that Phase 3 trials will run smoothly, which is not always the case. Trials for the vaccine being developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, for example, were paused when one of the volunteers experienced an illness. Because the illness turned out to be unrelated to the vaccine, the trials were resumed. But hiccups like this, or even bigger obstacles, can still threaten the progress of Phase 3 trials of all vaccines in the works.
Phase 3 trials are a crucial stage that involves testing thousands of people and comparing results with volunteers given a placebo. This determines if the vaccine is effective in protecting against SARS-CoV-2, and can reveal evidence of other possible side effects that may have been unseen in earlier studies.If a vaccine's Phase 3 trials go well, the results would still have to be assessed by FDAs of its home country and countries that want to distribute the vaccine domestically, like the Philippines.
Montoya said that it's possible for Phase 3 trial data to be submitted to both FDAs simultaneously but this process could lengthen the time it will take for the Philippine FDA to approve the vaccine for distribution. If the home country's FDA were to approve it first, which Montoya estimates could take a month, the Philippines' FDA's assessment would be aided by the approval of the home country's FDA.
Managing expectations set by Duterte
The more realistic expectation of a vaccine approval in the Philippines by the middle of 2021 is in stark contrast to the remarks of President Rodrigo Duterte that Filipinos need only wait until December for a vaccine.""I promise you, by the grace of God, I hope by December we would be back to normal.... Hintayin lang ho ninyo by December kung makatiis kayo (Just wait for December, if you can stand it),"" he said on July 31.
A month later, Duterte claimed that certain vaccines are to be ""distributed worldwide by September, October"" of 2020, again setting expectations.
""When the President said that the vacines are available, he's actually correct. It will be available maybe in their home countriesbut it's unlikely to be available in other countries like the Philippines because, as I said, it will also take time for them to submit their applications to our FDA and for FDA to review it before it can issue an approval for the said vaccine,"" said Montoya.
Duterte has pinned his hopes on 3 China-developed vaccine candidates, Russia's Sputnik V, and the vaccine candidates from US companies Moderna and Pfizer, and UK-Swedish company AstraZeneca.
Consistent with his geopolitical stance, he's given more praise to China and Russia for their assurances that the Philippines would get some level of ""priority"" access to their vaccines.
But he has slammed ""Western"" companies, likely referring to the US and European companies, for supposedly demanding a ""reservation fee"" which Duterte refuses to pay.
Montoya said this fee likely refers to Advance Market Commitment (AMC), which pharmaceutical companies usually ask from governments or other buyers, not just as advance payment but to boost its funding for vaccine development.
Ironically, the Philippines has already agreed to contribute to the AMC being collated by the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) Facility. The Duterte administration is ready to cough up P1.5 billion for the program which ensures that the Philippines and other participating countries will get 20% of their needed vaccine supply from a manufacturer.
Upcoming hurdles: Securing supply and distribution
But even with Philippine FDA approval of a vaccine, there's still the challenge of securing a supply of the vaccine, and then distributing it efficiently to Filipinos.
Montoya said that through the COVAX Facility, the Philippines is assured at least of 20% of its vaccine needs, which could mean two doses of a vaccine for around 10 million people. This is if the Philippines' vaccine needs amount to immunization of 60% of its population, the Department of Health threshold for herd immunity.
But the private sector could move independently of the government and secure its own supply of an FDA-approved vaccine. This means that Filipinos who can afford to can buy a vaccine from their doctor even ahead of the free immunization by the government, which would likely cover only health workers and the poorest Filipinos anyway.
Let's say a vaccine does reach a good number of Filipinos. That doesn't mean health measures like mask-wearing and social distancing will be lifted.
The government will have to see the effects of the vaccine and a significant decrease in the number of infected.
""The effect is not immediate. Yes, you have a vaccine. Yes, you may be protected but of course we still have to see first of all, whether you will have the antibodies and whether the antibodies will be sufficiently high enough and if it will last for a long time,"" said Montoya.
Some scientific groups say that a vaccine may have to be administered every year or once every two to 3 years.
Authorities would have to prepare for logistical concerns like ensuring a ""cold chain"" for a vaccine, or ways of transporting a vaccine such that it is kept to a certain low temperature. –

As experts around the world race to find an effective COVID-19 vaccine, the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) said it lacked some P10 billion needed to procure enough doses for the identified priority groups.
At the DOH’s regular press briefing on Monday, October 19, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that the initial P2.5 billion allocated for vaccines in the proposed 2021 budget would not cover procurement needed to vaccinate an initial target of 20% of the Philippines’ population.Citing estimated costs computed by the agency, Vergeire said the DOH would need roughly P12.1 billion to purchase doses needed to inoculate priority populations which include health workers and indigent Filipinos.
Vergeire said the amount was based on prospective prices for potential vaccines being marketed, most of which may require two doses.“It totaled to P12.1 billion so we lack about P10 billion in that budget,” Vergeire told reporters in a mix of English and Filipino.Vergeire had made the statement after referring to the lack of funds raised by Marikina City 2nd District Representative Stella Quimbo. She earlier expressed dismay over the P2.5 billion allocation, warning it would cover only 3.9 million of the targeted 20 million to be vaccinated.Why does this matter?
The lack of funds needed to procure enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine highlights the skewed priorities of the government’s pandemic recovery budget.While the country continues to record an increase in cases, the government has earmarked only some P90 billion for coronavirus efforts out of the proposed P4.5 trillion of the 2021 budget.The DOH’s shortfall of about P10 billion also comes as President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly touted a COVID-19 vaccine as the “only salvation” from the pandemic.MUST READ

What will the DOH do?
Vergeire said a portion of the government’s unprogrammed funds have been committed for the purchase of vaccines, while several lawmakers have also committed to sourcing the funds needed.The DOH is also studying the option of taking out loan from the Landbank of the Philippines or the Development Bank of the Philippines to cover the P10 billion shortfall for vaccines. – Rappler.com",Rappler,4.0,0.6467000246047974,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['shortfall', 'come', 'duterte', 'repeat', 'claim', 'salvation', 'pandemic', 'expert', 'world', 'race', 'find', 'effective', 'department', 'health', 'doh', 'say', 'lack', 'need', 'procure', 'enough', 'dose', 'identify', 'priority_group', 'doh', 'regular', 'press_briefe', 'monday', 'october', 'health', 'rosario_vergeire', 'say', 'initial', 'allocate', 'vaccine', 'propose', 'budget', 'cover', 'procurement', 'need', 'vaccinate', 'initial', 'target', 'population', 'cite', 'estimate', 'cost', 'compute', 'agency', 'vergeire', 'say', 'doh', 'need', 'roughly', 'purchase', 'dose', 'need', 'inoculate', 'priority', 'population', 'include', 'health', 'worker', 'indigent', 'filipino', 'vergeire', 'say', 'amount', 'base', 'prospective', 'price', 'potential', 'vaccine', 'market', 'require', 'dose', 'total', 'lack', 'budget', 'vergeire', 'told_reporter', 'mix', 'english', 'filipino', 'vergeire', 'make', 'statement', 'refer', 'lack', 'fund', 'raise', 'marikina', 'city', 'nd', 'district', 'representative', 'quimbo', 'early', 'express', 'dismay', 'allocation', 'warning', 'cover', 'targeted', 'vaccinate', 'matter', 'lack', 'fund', 'need', 'procure', 'enough', 'dose', 'highlight', 'skewed', 'priority', 'government', 'pandemic', 'recovery', 'budget', 'country', 'continue', 'record', 'increase', 'case', 'government', 'earmark', 'coronavirus', 'effort', 'propose', 'budget', 'doh', 'shortfall', 'also', 'come', 'repeatedly', 'tout', 'salvation', 'pandemic', 'must_read', 'urge', 'country', 'wait', 'doh', 'vergeire', 'say', 'portion', 'government', 'unprogrammed', 'fund', 'commit', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'several', 'lawmaker', 'also', 'commit', 'source', 'fund', 'need', 'doh', 'also', 'study', 'option', 'take', 'loan', 'landbank', 'cover', 'shortfall', 'vaccine', 'com']",-0.3818,0.086,0.842,0.072,0.40976331360946744,Negative

'Any substance that will effectively and safely protect people is considered halal, especially if it is the only viable option at present,' says Saidamen Pangarungan, secretary of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos
Filipino Muslim leaders on Thursday, February 4, supported the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines and quelled fears that these might contain pork products that they do not consider halal (permissible).
""Any substance that will effectively and safely protect people is considered halal, especially if it is the only viable option at present,"" said Saidamen Pangarungan, secretary of the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos, in a statement signed by 7 other Islamic leaders.
Pangarungan noted, on one hand, that halal certifying bodies or HCBs in the Philippines have not examined these COVID-19 vaccines.
He said Muslim leaders in the United Kingdom, on the other hand, have issued a favorable fatwa or ruling on these. This fatwa, according to him, states: ""The UK government has confirmed that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine does not contain any components of animal origin.""
Pangarungan said Pfizer also claims ""that all of their vaccine's components are either plant-based or are synthetic."" Like Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna ""have also stated that their vaccines do not use gelatin or pork products.""
In neighboring Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim-majority country, Muslim leaders recently certified the Chinese vaccine CoronaVac, too, as halal.

""Due to the pressing need to curb the spread of COVID-19, all Filipinos are urged to avail of the vaccine once they become available in the country,"" Pangarungan said, adding that ""Islam emphasizes the need to protect life.""
Whether COVID-19 vaccines are halal has worried many Muslims around the world, as pork-derived gelatin is commonly used in producing vaccines. Muslim beliefs prohibit the consumption of pork.
More than 6 million Muslims live in the Philippines, making up around 6% of this predominantly Christian country.
The Philippine government has sought the help of religious groups to convince Filipinos to take vaccine shots after a recent Pulse Asia survey showed 47% of Filipinos refuse to get vaccinated against COVID-19.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire gives the assurance amid questions on whether the Philippines can procure the vaccine of US company Moderna, which did not hold clinical trials in the country
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Wednesday, November 18, assured the public that the Philippine government can still procure COVID-19 vaccines from companies like Moderna that did not hold clinical trials in the country.
Vergeire gave the assurance during a virtual press briefing, when she was asked whether the absence of local clinical trials of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine would have any implication on the government's vaccine procurement plan.
""Although, of course, that is the ideal. But if they do not intend, hindi 'yan makaka-stop sa gobyerno para makapag-procure tayo (it won't stop the government to procure) as long as they [follow] the regulatory process at makikita po natin ang mga naging epekto ng kanilang (and we can see the effects [or results] of their] phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3,"" Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing.
She added that if the country's vaccine expert panel would be able to evaluate the vaccine and gets the Food and Drug Administration approval, ""then we can readily procure these sets of vaccines.""
Moderna announced on Monday that its experimental vaccine against COVID-19 was almost 95% effective, marking a second major breakthrough in the quest to end the pandemic.
Moderna released early results from a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants, days after American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced that said their vaccine was 90% effective.

Vergeire earlier said that Moderna was not ""really interested in conducting clinical trials outside the US, but they want to provide [doses] to us."" (READ: PH in talks for possible purchase of US Moderna vaccine by 2021)
Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval in the US and around the world within weeks, and said it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect human health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr, who is also the National Task Force Chief Implementer, said on November 9 that supplies of a COVID-19 vaccine will most likely arrive in the Philippines by the end of 2021 or in early 2022.
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier said that his goal is for his government to shoulder COVID-19 vaccination for each Filipino, but only P2.5 billion was allocated for COVID-19 vaccines in the proposed 2021 national budget. (READ: DOH short of P10 billion for COVID-19 vaccines)

(UPDATED) The Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, East Avenue Medical Center, and Dr Jose N Rodriguez Hospital specifically will receive doses of the Pfizer vaccine
When a COVID-19 vaccine finally arrives in the Philippines, initial doses will be prioritized for health workers working in hospitals treating coronavirus patients.Vaccine czar Carlito Gavlez Jr said hospital workers in high-risk geographical areas would be among the first to be vaccinated against the disease since it was necessary to ensure essential health services continued while the pandemic was still ongoing.“Our hospitals will be first,” Galvez said when asked by Senator Nancy Binay where first doses of a vaccine will go.
Which vaccine will be given?
On February 3, Galvez listed the Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, East Avenue Medical Center, and Dr Jose N Rodriguez Hospital specifically will receive 117,000 doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine supplied by the COVAX facility.
After these hospitals located in Metro Manila – the epicenter of the pandemic in the Philippines – COVID-19 referral hospitals in Cebu City and Davao City will follow.
Another 5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine are expected to arrive in the first half of 2021.
Considering the status of negotiations and regulatory requirements, Galvez earlier said the first vaccines that could arrive in the Philippines include those being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, Sinovac, or AstraZeneca.
Among these options, Galvez said Pfizer’s vaccine may be the first to arrive by the end of February through allocations from the GAVI COVAX facility. COVAX officials are currently finalizing a list of low-income countries to be given doses of Pfizer’s vaccine for an early rollout.Galvez said a specific amount of doses to arrive were not yet available as arrangements were still being finalized, though shipments may contain some 50,000 doses for 25,000 health workers.
Unlike other vaccines being eyed by the government, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have so far secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Pfizer vaccine was the first to be granted emergency approval after the FDA said its review process determined the Pfizer vaccine with an efficacy of 95% met all conditions for an EUA and that that the “benefit of using the vaccine outweighs its known and potential risks.”

As for Sinovac, Galvez said the government signed a term sheet that saw the company commit to supply with country with 25 million doses, though this will be contingent on whether it secured FDA emergency approval.
Without clearance from the FDA, Sinovac cannot be used in the Philippines. The company earlier submitted an application for an EUA, but FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the agency was waiting for phase 3 trial results before moving on to a full review.

Cold storage preparation
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the government was preparing ultracold storage facilities needed to keep Pfizer’s vaccines stable once they arrive in the country.Duque said the agency purchased 10 ultralow freezers for this, while officials were also in talks with several logistics and cold storage facilities that have the facilities and extensive experience to handle the vaccine. This included Orca, Royal Cargo, Maersk, LBC, Metro Pacific, and Zuellig Pharma Corporation, among others.
Pfizer officials earlier explained that while doses may last up to 6 months in ultra-low temperature freezers, they can be stored up to 30 days in thermal shippers the company designed, and up to 5 days in normal refrigerated 2-8°C conditions – posing a challenge for the Philippines’ health system. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.9969000220298767,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['update', 'east', 'avenue', 'hospital', 'specifically', 'receive', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'finally', 'arrive', 'initial', 'dose', 'prioritize', 'health', 'worker', 'working', 'hospital', 'treat', 'coronavirus', 'patient', 'say', 'hospital', 'worker', 'geographical', 'area', 'first', 'vaccinate', 'disease', 'necessary', 'ensure', 'essential', 'health', 'service', 'continue', 'pandemic', 'still', 'ongoing', 'hospital', 'first', 'galvez', 'say', 'ask', 'senator', 'first', 'dose', 'go', 'give', 'february', 'galvez', 'list', 'east', 'avenue', 'hospital', 'specifically', 'receive', 'dose', 'supply', 'covax_facility', 'hospital', 'locate', 'metro', 'epicenter', 'pandemic', 'referral_hospital', 'cebu', 'city', 'follow', 'dose', 'astrazeneca', 'expect', 'arrive', 'first', 'half', 'consider', 'status', 'negotiation', 'regulatory', 'requirement', 'galvez', 'early', 'say', 'first', 'vaccine', 'arrive', 'include', 'develop', 'sinovac', 'astrazeneca', 'option', 'galvez', 'say', 'pfizer', 'first', 'arrive', 'end', 'february', 'allocation', 'covax_facility', 'covax', 'official', 'currently', 'finalize', 'list', 'low_income', 'country', 'give', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'early', 'rollout', 'galvez', 'say', 'specific', 'amount', 'dose', 'arrive', 'yet', 'available', 'arrangement', 'still', 'finalize', 'shipment', 'contain', 'dose', 'health', 'worker', 'vaccine', 'eyed', 'government', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'far', 'secure', 'authorization', 'food', 'fda', 'pfizer', 'first', 'approval', 'fda', 'say', 'review', 'process', 'determine', 'pfizer', 'efficacy', 'meet', 'condition', 'eua', 'benefit', 'use', 'outweigh', 'known', 'potential_risk', 'must_read', 'clear', 'pfizer', 'sinovac', 'galvez', 'say', 'government', 'sign', 'see', 'company', 'commit', 'supply', 'country', 'dose', 'contingent', 'secure', 'emergency', 'approval', 'clearance', 'fda', 'sinovac', 'use', 'company', 'early', 'submit', 'application', 'say', 'agency', 'wait', 'phase', 'trial', 'result', 'move', 'full', 'review', 'must_read', 'senate', 'hearing', 'put', 'heat', 'duterte', 'gov', 'negotiation', 'sinovac', 'cold_storage', 'preparation', 'health', 'say', 'government', 'prepare', 'ultracold', 'storage_facilitie', 'need', 'keep', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'stable', 'arrive', 'country', 'duque', 'say', 'agency', 'purchase', 'ultralow', 'freezer', 'official', 'also', 'talk', 'several', 'logistic', 'facility', 'facility', 'extensive', 'experience', 'handle', 'include', 'orca', 'royal', 'cargo', 'maersk', 'lbc', 'metro', 'pacific', 'zuellig', 'pharma', 'corporation', 'among_other', 'pfizer', 'official', 'early', 'explain', 'dose', 'last', 'month', 'ultra_low', 'temperature', 'freezer', 'store', 'day', 'thermal', 'shipper', 'company', 'design', 'day', 'normal_refrigerate', 'condition', 'pose', 'challenge', 'health', 'system', 'com']",0.9682,0.009,0.893,0.097,0.3949404761904762,Positive

Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III says the government and private sector are in negotiations for 178 million doses for Filipinos
The Philippines is preparing to order enough coronavirus vaccines for 92 million doses, 20 million more than its vaccination program target, in anticipation of delays and other complications, said Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III.
He gave this figure in a report to President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday, February 1, at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse during a meeting with other Cabinet members.
""We have negotiated for 92 million because we read in the newspapers about slippage, delays in delivery. There's delays in Europe, there's delays in the US, so to be safe we are negotiating more than what we need of 70 million,"" said Dominguez.
""We really expect delays but delay is not our fault because we have the money and we are ready, the delay is in the manufacturing,"" he continued.
The government and private sector are already in negotiations to bring the Philippines' total vaccine orders to 178 million doses, said Dominguez. Since most COVID-19 vaccines come in two doses, these would be enough for 89 million Filipinos.
Funding for vaccines
As it stands, the country has locked in some 146 million doses of vaccines – 40 million from the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility and some 106 million to 108 million from direct arrangements with various pharmaceutical firms.
Dominguez said the deals with firms will be paid for using loans from the World Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, cumulatively worth $1.2 billion.
Meanwhile, the Philippines paid $84 million to participate in the COVAX scheme, said Dominguez.
The 146 million doses would be enough to vaccinate all Filipino adults, which the finance chief said number around 70 million. The remaining 40 million in the country's population are one to 18 year-olds who may not be allowed to get vaccine shots for safety reasons. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.64410001039505,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['finance', 'secretary_carlo', 'say', 'government', 'private_sector', 'negotiation', 'dose', 'filipino', 'prepare', 'order', 'enough', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'dose', 'target', 'anticipation', 'delay', 'complication', 'say', 'finance', 'secretary_carlo', 'give', 'figure', 'report', 'duterte', 'february', 'golf', 'clubhouse', 'meet', 'negotiate', 'read', 'newspaper', 'slippage', 'delay', 'delivery', 'delay', 'europe', 's', 'delay', 'safe', 'negotiating', 'need', 'say', 'dominguez', 'really', 'expect', 'delay', 'delay', 'fault', 'money', 'ready', 'delay', 'manufacture', 'continue', 'government', 'already', 'negotiation', 'bring', 'total', 'order', 'dose', 'say', 'dominguez', 'vaccine', 'come', 'dose', 'enough', 'filipino', 'fund', 'vaccine', 'stand', 'country', 'lock', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'lead', 'direct', 'arrangement', 'various', 'pharmaceutical_firm', 'dominguez', 'say', 'deal', 'firm', 'pay', 'use', 'loan', 'world', 'bank', 'asian_development', 'bank', 'asian', 'infrastructure', 'investment', 'bank', 'cumulatively', 'worth', 'meanwhile', 'pay', 'participate', 'covax', 'scheme', 'say', 'dominguez', 'dose', 'enough', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'adult', 'finance', 'chief', 'say', 'number', 'remaining', 'countrys', 'population', 'year', 'old', 'allow', 'get', 'shot', 'safety', 'reason', 'com']",-0.7096,0.149,0.75,0.101,0.3821428571428571,Negative

The Philippines has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year
The Philippines will let thousands of its healthcare workers, mostly nurses, take up jobs in Britain and Germany if the two countries agree to donate much-needed coronavirus vaccines, a senior official said on Tuesday, February 23.
The Philippines, which has among Asia's highest number of coronavirus cases, has relaxed a ban on deploying its healthcare workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year.
Alice Visperas, director of the labor ministry's international affairs bureau, said the Philippines was open to lifting the cap in exchange for vaccines from Britain and Germany, which it would use to inoculate outbound workers and hundreds of thousands of Filipino repatriates.
Nurses are among the millions of Filipinos who work overseas, providing in excess of $30 billion a year in remittances vital to the country's economy.
""We are considering the request to lift the deployment cap, subject to agreement,"" Visperas told Reuters.
Britain is grappling with the world's sixth-highest coronavirus death toll and one of the worst economic hits from the pandemic, while Germany has the 10th most infections globally.
While the two countries have inoculated a combined 23 million people, the Philippines has yet to start its campaign to immunize 70 million adults, or two-thirds of its 108 million people. It expects to receive its first batch of vaccines this week, donated by China.
The Philippines wants to secure 148 million doses of vaccines altogether.
The British embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while calls to Germany's mission went unanswered.
In 2019, almost 17,000 Filipino nurses signed overseas work contracts, government data showed.
While Filipino nurses have fought to lift the deployment ban to escape poor working conditions and low pay at home, the workers-for-vaccine plan has not gone down well with some medical workers.

A timeline shared by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III shows how a mix of red tape and unfamiliarity with new vaccine technology slowed down the process of securing a purchase deal long before it could even start
From the early days of the pandemic, President Rodrigo Duterte has repeatedly touted the need for a vaccine to salvage the country from COVID-19.Several of the Chief Executive’s speeches have been peppered with statements on the much-needed relief a vaccine would bring to the economy, along with promises to inoculate the entire population for free.But new details shared by Health Secretary Francisco Duque III showed it took the Duterte administration about 4 to 5 months to sign a confidentiality data agreement (CDA) that would cover negotiations with vaccine developer Pfizer, raising questions about whether government officials moved fast enough to secure for the country the scarce supply.From when Pfizer officials approached the Philippine government in late June to start discussions on its vaccine candidates, it was only in late October, or 4 months after, that the CDA, a preliminary document, was signed. With other government officials like vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr, the timeline stretched further to November when a CDA was finalized.Duque detailed the timeline of critical dates in the government’s dealings with Pfizer officials in response to allegations that he bungled a deal to secure the vaccine supplies by January.The health secretary found himself on the defense after Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr posted a cryptic tweet that an offer brokered by him, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez, and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would have locked in 10 million doses of the vaccine by as early as January 2021 “but that somebody dropped the ball.”“I have the chronology of events so that this is all documented. So there is no such thing as 'I did not act quick enough,'” Duque said in an interview on ANC Headstart on Thursday, December 17.MUST READ
Locsin shares foiled plan to secure 10M Pfizer vaccine doses by January
Red tape
What Duque’s timeline does show is how a mix of bureaucratic red tape, coupled with the uncertainty of a new vaccine, hampered the process of negotiating a purchase deal long before it could even start.In the case of a CDA – a preliminary document that would allow scientists to review Pfizer’s vaccine development data – signing this would be the first step in opening negotiations on the possible securement of doses.
Yetgovernment agencies passed the buck in signing a CDA on behalf of the Philippine government.First, from the DOH, Duque said an inter-agency task force resolution mandated that Pfizer’s overview on its vaccines should be given to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development as the lead agency in vaccine assessment.This differed from the preference of Pfizer, which initially wanted the Office of the President to sign the CDA on behalf of the government. It would take another month for the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) to designate the DOH as signatory.While the period for signing a CDA varies for the parties involved and terms being discussed, the global race to secure limited vaccine supplies has underscored the need not just for money, but agility from governments to move on locking down purchase deals. In a pandemic where hundreds may become ill or die in a single day, time is a precious resource.
How much of a factor was red tape in the weeks it took the government to sign a CDA with Pfizer? Duque was evasive, saying a new vaccine should afford the government some “allowance.”
“You have to give allowances to the fact that, I for one, this is my first time to have signed a CDA. So I have to be very, very cautious in what I am signing to ensure the government’s interest is first and foremost protected. That there are no onerous provisions,” Duque said.Asked why the OES, on behalf of the OP, passed on the responsibly to the DOH, Duque said the decision was also fueled by caution.“It was his judgment that because (a) vaccine is health-related, it was directly aligned to the mandate of the DOH. So that reason is well grounded,” he said.On the other hand, the health secretary said the process for evaluating vaccines was also revised in the context of the pandemic.Whereas the DOH was usually the only agency that assessed vaccines to be used in the Philippines, the inter-agency task force agreed the DOST would lead reviews through an expert panel focused on the scientific assessment of a COVID-19 vaccine.The arrangement, though well-intended, exposed how added layers of screening could prove detrimental if not optimized for a highly competitive vaccine like Pfizer and BioNTech’s.“Medyo talagang nung una, nagkakaproblema kasi (At the start, this was a problem because) if we follow the process, dapat nga 'yan (that should be) DOST, based on the IATF. It was Pfizer that wanted the Office of the President,” Duque said.MUST READ

Balancing act
This battle against time had to contend with the uncertainty over a new vaccine.As a public official, Duque said protocols must be followed and that “we cannot just be buying a vaccine like chocolate.” Further, as a medical professional, Duque said his principle was to remain prudent. “My overriding principle in my practice of medicine is always to err on the side of caution,” he said.For Duque, another factor that influenced his actions was the memory of the Dengvaxia scandal that tanked child immunization rates in the Philippines. The aftermath took its toll on children as the Philippines experienced a measles and polio outbreak it continues to address until today.
“There are too many unknowns and that’s why I said earlier, my overriding principle is, we have to be cautious with the health and lives of our people. We have long experience with different vaccines and we don’t want a repeat of very costly lessons we experienced in the past with some of the vaccines,” he said.The following key dates, as enumerated by Duque, detail this process:(We have included all dates mentioned, along with Duque’s description of events that took place on specific dates.)
June 24, 2020 -Pfizer sends an overview of its candidate vaccine development and manufacturing program to the Philippine government.June 29, 2020 - DOH, through its pharmaceutical division, refers the proposal to the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD) as the lead agency in the management of vaccine development for COVID-19 response.August 6 - DOH sends a letter to Pfizer reiterating that its overview should be given to the DOST.August 7 - A meeting is held between Pfizer and DOH officials to discuss the use of its mRNA or messenger RNA technology in the company’s potential COVID-19 vaccine.Duque said that this meeting is where he raised many questions on the use of mRNA vaccines and whether or not these have been deployed in different countries. “And they said yes for HIV-AIDS and that’s about it. There has been no experience; DOH neither has experience in these long years of its immunization program, we never had this kind of technology,” he said.August 11 - Pfizer sends a draft CDA to the DOH.Duque said the CDA was initially meant to be signed by the Office of the Executive Secretary (OES) on behalf of all government agencies.This arrangement would have eliminated the need for multiple government agencies to sign their own CDA with Pfizer. In a recent forum, the DOH said that they were trying to streamline the current setup which saw different agencies each having their own CDAs.August 26 - DOH re-endorses to Pfizer comments from “relevant technical offices” in the Philippine government.Duque said he cannot disclose details of the agreement or its provisions as he is bound by the CDA.
September 4 - Pfizer meets with key DOH and DOST officials, as well as Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea to provide updates on their vaccine development.At this time, Duque said Pfizer explained it had two candidates qualified in terms of a safety and efficacy profile after Phase 1 and 2 trials.He also said this is when the company disclosed it had the potential supply of 100 million doses by the end of 2020, though this would be subject to regulatory approval. The company added it had a projected production of 1.3 billion doses by 2021, he added.Duque claimed 10 million doses were said to be set aside for the world market “outside of those that were given to the originating countries like the US,” in effect, disputing Locsin’s claim that the amount was offered specifically to the Philippines.Aside from this, Duque said the company was not interested in conducting Phase 3 trials– something the country preferred so that it could clear the vaccine for “ethnic diversity.” Researchers often test medicines on diverse populations as not all race and ethnic groups will respond the same way to medicines and potential side effects.On Friday, December 16, Locsin maintained an offer from the US had been made on Pfizer's vaccine but that it has since gone to Singapore.
September 11 - Pfizer receives the DOH’s comments on the CDADuque said there was a back and forth between the government and Pfizer officials on certain provisions that were supposedly “one-sided.”“This is not as simple as drafting a document for a medicine or vaccine that you’ve used in the past,” he said in Filipino.September 14 - Duque receives a revised draft CDA with revisions from the office of the deputy executive secretary. He says he also forwarded a summary of revisions from Pfizer and the DOH, among others.September 17 - The DOH sends a letter to the OES on the CDA. Reviews take place over the next few days.
September 24 - Pfizer sends an email to the DOH, saying it had been advised by the Office of the President, through the office of the executive secretary, that the DOH will be the signatory to the CDA. The company also requests for a coordination meeting. “So we met immediately,” Duque said.September 25 - The DOH responds to hold a meeting with Pfizer.Duque said this was needed since Pfizer initially wanted the President’s office to sign the CDA.“Hindi nga ako pupuwede mag-sign (I really cannot sign) for the national government. I can only sign for the DOH. And that is why it is small wonder that DOST also signed in November a separate CDA with Pfizer. Even Secretary Galvez signed a separate CDA with Pfizer also in November,” Duque said on Thursday.October 20 - Duque signs the CDA with Pfizer.According to him, Pfizer agreed that the DOH could sign on behalf of the government, on the condition that it would sign separate CDAs with different agencies as needed.Significant deal
While negotiations are ongoing between Pfizer officials and the Philippine government, what may have been a possible delay in signing necessary documents could prove costly for Filipinos.
Though Pfizer’s vaccine possessed a logistical headache for the Philippines, it has a strategic position in attaining emergency authorization from the FDA.For one, the US FDA has issued its own emergency authorization for the vaccine – a major factor and requirement to attaining a similar emergency clearance from the Philippines. This is buoyed by several clearances that regulatory agencies in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom have granted the company.Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine was also the first to show promising results of 95% efficacy. This was announced on November 18.
Meanwhile, for all of the health secretary's uncertainty on the vaccine, a CDA could have covered in part, if not full, a review of scientific and trial data that would shed light on the way the vaccine worked. Duque mentioned that the agreement was to facilitate the sharing of data.

For now, Filipinos must wait as no details on the specific number of doses to be purchased by the government have been disclosed. On how soon these may be deployed, Galvez said Pfizer's vaccine may arrive in the country by the 3rd quarter of 2021 at the earliest, along with the bulk of other vaccines eyed by the Philippines.On Thursday, December 17, Senator Francis Pangilinan said that if it can be established that a government official ""inexcusably"" failed to act, then he may be sued under Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-graft law.Specifically, Section 3(e) of RA 3019 listed corrupt actions to include:
“Causing any undue injury to any party, including the Government, or giving any private party any unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference in the discharge of his official administrative or judicial functions through manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross inexcusable negligence.”
Former Supreme Court spokesperson Ted Te also said non-feasance or the failure to perform duty by a public official “amounts to an offense cognizable by the Ombudsman.”MUST READ
The survivor: Francisco Duque III
Asked why he signed the CDA 3 weeks after the OES passed the responsibility to him, Duque said a final review on some contentious provisions took place but that he signed the agreement on the same day he consulted Deputy Executive Secretary Michael Ong on these.
“I put my life on the line for this. I was also thinking that maybe after sometime this vaccine will prove effective. That was my judgment call,” he said. – Rappler.com",Rappler,3.0,0.6820999979972839,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['timeline', 'share', 'health', 'show',

The latest allegation sees the Department of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of Science and Technology denying it did not act on Sinopharm's proposals for vaccine trials in the country
While the Duterte government’s use of smuggled coronavirus vaccines remains unresolved, Philippine health officials once again found themselves on the defense against accusations of negligence.The latest allegation on Friday, January 1, sees the Department of Health (DOH) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denying it stalled documents needed for late stage trials of a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Chinese state-owned firm Sinopharm.The DOH and FDA branded as “baseless” reports that it failed to act on documents needed for the Philippines’ participation in trials for the vaccine, pointing instead to Sinopharm’s lack of a reply to a letter the Philippine government sent on its proposals for collaboration.The issue is the latest in a wave of rumors facing the DOH and FDA as the Philippines lags in a global race to secure supplies of a COVID-19 vaccine either through access to doses in Phase 3 trials or through purchase agreements.Before the issue raised involving Sinopharm, officials from the two agencies leading the Philippines pandemic response were forced to address allegations it bungled a deal assuring Filipinos early access to Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine.And only days ago were health officials again bewildered by early vaccination efforts done by top government officials and members of President Rodrigo Duterte’s close-in security.The unregulated immunization activities had involved the use of smuggled COVID-19 vaccines, violating a number of laws including the FDA Act. It remains unresolved as the Duterte government has not answered questions hounding the searing issue.MUST READ
5 nagging questions the Duterte gov’t has not answered on its use of unregistered vaccines
What Sinopharm trials?
In an official statement on Friday, the DOH and FDA responded to reports “purporting that the DOH did not act on documents for the participation of the Philippines in the clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Sinopharm.”
The DOH denied this, citing an inter-agency task force (IATF) resolution issued last May 2020, where it had approved Sinopharm’s participation in trials in the Philippines.While the IATF approved the Department of Science and Technology’s (DOST) recommendation to collaborate with Sinopharm for trials, part of this included securing the FDA’s approval for trials.The DOST also belied accusations the Philippine government did not take necessary steps to push trials forward, saying it responded to Sinopharm’s proposals for collaboration.The DOST said Sinopharm proposed cooperation could take place in two ways. First, through trials that the Philippines would fund or through the Philippine government recognizing of authorization for Sinopharm’s vaccine granted by China’s regulatory authorities.On the first proposal, the DOST said the Philippines “only funds trials under the WHO (World Health Organization) Solidarity Trial.” The DOST, meanwhile, did not mention if it commented on Sinopharm’s second proposal. But by practice and FDA guidelines on granting emergency authorizations for COVID-19 vaccines, China’s FDA is not among worldwide regulatory authorities the Philippines included for “reliance or recognition” pathways when granting approval for vaccines.The use of “reliance and recognition pathways” help to speed approval of medical goods by allowing the FDA to cooperate with trusted authorities– like their counterparts in the United States, Japan, Australia, European Union, Singapore, South Korea, United Kingdom, and the World Health Organization, among others.The DOST said “Sinopharm never responded to this letter” where it replied to its proposals.In October 2020, the Chinese firm informed the Philippines it was no longer interested in conducting trials, saying it opted to supply doses of the vaccine to the country.The FDA added that as of January 1, 2021, Sinopharm has not submitted any application for clinical trials nor emergency use authorization (EUA) of their vaccine in the Philippines. Only Pfizer has applied for an EUA in the Philippines.

Why it matters
As rest of the world moves forward to secure more doses, the Philippines has so far only closed a solid purchase agreement with AstraZeneca.A tripartite agreement involving the pharmaceutical firm, the Philippine government, and private sector secured 2.6 million doses, while a second batch is in negotiations.Other than this, Phase 3 clinical trials for Janssen Pharmaceutica’s vaccine are expected to begin this month after its application was approved before the end of 2020.Meanwhile, the Duterte government is banking on the arrival of Chinese vaccines by March so it could start to tame the pandemic within the first few months of 2021 but so far, no vaccine made in China has applied for the necessary emergency authority to be granted by the FDA.Obstacles facing the Philippines procurement of vaccines come against the backdrop of increasing COVID-19 cases.

The filing sets in motion about a month-long process where regulators review and decide on the application
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Wednesday, January 6, that drug maker AstraZeneca has submitted an application for emergency approval of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.
“They did. Just now,” FDA Director General Enrique Domingo confirmed to Rappler in a text message on Wednesday afternoon.AstraZeneca’s application is the second to be filed with the FDA, following Pfizer’s submission to the agency last December 23. The application brings AstraZeneca a step closer to allowing Filipinos access to its vaccine within the year.With AstraZeneca’s submission now with the FDA, regulators will spend about a month reviewing trial data and other information to determine the quality, safety, and efficacy of its COVID-19 vaccine on the Philippine population.AstraZeneca was recently granted emergency approval in the United Kingdom, making it the first country to roll out the vaccine for public use.MUST READ

Why this matters
AstraZeneca’s filing is timely and strategic considering the company is the only firm to sign solid tripartite agreements with the national government, local government units, and private sector in the Philippines.This includes a purchase deal closed by the private sector and national government for 2.6 million doses, as well as a separate deal signed by Quezon City for 750,000 doses.Apart from this, Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship and Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion earlier said negotiations for a second batch were underway as over 200 companies “and counting” pledged to purchase and expressed their interest in the vaccine.
Vaccine performance
The company’s vaccine is among those at the forefront of vaccine development.Early analysis of clinical trial results showed an average efficacy of about 70%. On the higher end, the vaccine was seen to be 90% effective in participants who were given a half dose, followed by a full dose. This was compared to 62% efficacy seen in participants who were given two full doses.Its vaccine can be transported and handled ""at normal refrigerated conditions"" of between 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 6 months, making it compatible with the Department of Health (DOH) storage facilities. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.5289999842643738,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['filing', 'set', 'motion', 'month', 'long', 'process', 'regulator', 'review', 'decide', 'application', 'food', 'say', 'january', 'drug', 'maker', 'astrazeneca', 'submit', 'application', 'emergency', 'approval', 'fda', 'confirm', 'text', 'message', 'wednesday', 'afternoon', 'astrazeneca', 'application', 'second', 'file', 'fda', 'follow', 'pfizer', 'submission', 'agency', 'last', 'december', 'application', 'bring', 'astrazeneca', 'step', 'close', 'allow', 'filipino', 'access', 'year', 'astrazeneca', 'submission', 'fda', 'regulator', 'spend', 'month', 'review', 'trial', 'datum', 'information', 'determine', 'quality', 'safety', 'efficacy', 'population', 'astrazeneca', 'recently', 'approval', 'united_kingdom', 'make', 'first', 'country', 'roll', 'public', 'use', 'must_read', 'fda', 'approval', 'vaccine', 'med', 'matter', 'astrazeneca', 'file', 'timely', 'strategic', 'consider', 'company', 'firm', 'sign', 'solid', 'tripartite', 'agreement', 'national', 'government', 'local', 'government', 'unit', 'private_sector', 'include', 'purchase', 'deal', 'close', 'national', 'government', 'dose', 'well', 'separate', 'deal', 'sign', 'quezon_city', 'dose', 'apart', 'presidential_adviser', 'go', 'negosyo', 'founder', 'early', 'say', 'negotiation', 'second', 'batch', 'underway', 'company', 'count', 'pledge', 'purchase', 'performance', 'company', 'forefront', 'development', 'early', 'analysis', 'clinical', 'trial', 'result', 'show', 'average', 'efficacy', 'high', 'end', 'see', 'effective', 'participant', 'give', 'half', 'dose', 'follow', 'full', 'dose', 'compare', 'efficacy', 'see', 'participant', 'give', 'full', 'dose', 'transport', 'handle', 'normal_refrigerate', 'condition', 'least', 'month', 'make', 'compatible', 'department', 'health', 'doh', 'storage_facilitie', 'com']",0.9612,0.014,0.848,0.138,0.29596491228070176,Positive

""The members of the IATF...approved the participation of the Philippines in the Gavi COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, including the corresponding allocation of funds,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.
The COVAX Facility is a system that ensures ""fair and equitable"" allocation of the COVID-19 vaccine.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 75 countries have submitted expressions of interest to join the COVAX Facility.
""The 75 countries, which would finance the vaccines from their own public finance budgets, partner with up to 90 lower-income countries that could be supported through voluntary donations to Gavi’s COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC),"" the WHO said in an earlier statement.

The ADB says the Philippines may opt to increase its vaccine borrowings up to $500 million (P24.05 billion) from the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility
Asian Development Bank (ADB) country director Kelly Bird on Monday, December 21, said the Philippine government asked for $325 million (P15.6 billion) for the purchase and logistical costs of COVID-19 vaccines.
Bird said the Philippines may opt to increase its vaccine borrowings up to $500 million (P24.05 billion) from the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), which has a total allocation of $9 billion for ADB member countries.
The loan terms and interest rate have not been disclosed yet, as the ADB is still coordinating the deal with the Department of Finance and the Department of Health. Bird, however, noted that the loan will be concessional or will have a long grace period and low interest rate.
Bird added that the amount is ""above and beyond"" the $9.4-billion (P452-billion) sovereign lending program for the Philippines, which covers mostly infrastructure projects.
Criteria
The ADB said it will only fund vaccines that have satisfied any of the following criteria:Selected for procurement via COVAX on behalf of participating countriesPrequalified by the World Health Organization
Authorized by a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) for manufacture in an SRA country or the SRA has authorized its manufacture in a non-SRA country
The Philippine government would also submit a national vaccination plan, which safeguards against exclusion of marginalized and vulnerable groups.
The latest developments on the financing that the government is tapping come as it lags in the race to get COVID-19 vaccines.
Indonesia has secured 338 million doses from 5 developers, while Malaysia has secured 14 million doses, most of which would come from Pfizer.
The Philippines' first stockpile of vaccines, 2.6 million doses worth around P700 million, were secured through the efforts of the private sector.
President Rodrigo Duterte and his team struggled to pay in advance for vaccines, supposedly due to the country's strict procurement laws. But even Duterte's officials, particularly his spokesperson Harry Roque, noted that international deals are exempted from such rules.
Meanwhile, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III pointed to red tape coupled with the uncertainty of a new vaccine as factors hampering the process of negotiating a purchase deal. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.638700008392334,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['adb', 'say', 'opt', 'increase', 'borrowing', 'asia', 'pacific', 'access', 'facility', 'asian_development', 'bank', 'adb', 'country', 'director', 'kelly', 'bird', 'say', 'government', 'ask', 'purchase', 'logistical', 'cost', 'vaccine', 'bird', 'say', 'opt', 'increase', 'borrowing', 'asia', 'pacific', 'access', 'facility', 'apvax', 'total', 'allocation', 'adb', 'member', 'country', 'loan', 'term', 'interest', 'rate', 'disclose', 'adb', 'still', 'coordinate', 'deal', 'department', 'finance', 'department', 'health', 'bird', 'however', 'note', 'loan', 'concessional', 'long', 'grace', 'period', 'low', 'interest', 'rate', 'bird', 'add', 'amount', 'sovereign', 'lending', 'program', 'cover', 'mostly', 'infrastructure', 'project', 'criterion', 'adb', 'say', 'fund', 'vaccine', 'satisfied', 'follow', 'criterion', 'select', 'procurement', 'covax', 'behalf', 'participate', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'authorize', 'stringent', 'regulatory', 'authority', 'sra', 'manufacture', 'sra', 'country', 'sra', 'authorize', 'manufacture', 'sra', 'country', 'government', 'also', 'submit', 'national', 'vaccination', 'plan', 'safeguard', 'exclusion', 'marginalize', 'vulnerable', 'group', 'late', 'development', 'financing', 'government', 'tap', 'come', 'lag', 'race', 'get', 'vaccine', 'indonesia', 'secure', 'dose', 'developer', 'malaysia', 'secure', 'dose', 'come', 'first', 'stockpile', 'vaccine', 'dose', 'worth', 'secured', 'effort', 'duterte', 'team', 'struggle', 'pay', 'advance', 'vaccine', 'supposedly', 'due', 'countrys', 'strict', 'procurement', 'law', 'even', 'duterte', 'official', 'particularly', 'roque', 'note', 'international', 'deal', 'exempt', 'rule', 'meanwhile', 'health', 'point', 'red_tape', 'couple', 'uncertainty', 'new', 'factor', 'hamper', 'process', 'negotiate', 'purchase', 'deal', 'com']",0.9349,0.074,0.77,0.156,0.4564141414141413,Positive

(1st UPDATE) Father Nicanor Austriaco’s assertion runs contrary to WHO’s position that 'there is no reason not to recommend its use,' even in countries where the South African variant was detected
The Philippines’ 17 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses ""will be ineffective"" – because they would supposedly require an additional shot per person – if the government cannot curb cases of the COVID-19 South African variant in the country, an expert warned on Wednesday, March 3.
In a virtual press briefing, Octa Research fellow and molecular biologist Father Nicanor Austriaco cited studies showing that the efficacy of the ""AstraZeneca vaccine against B1351 dramatically decreased from 70% to 10%.""""With 10% protection, basically, most people would still be able to get mild and moderate COVID-19,"" he said.
The study cited by Austriaco was disclosed by AstraZeneca itself. It had a small sample involving healthy young adults. (READ: AstraZeneca COVID shot less effective against South African variant – study)
The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) of the World Health Organization (WHO) still recommends the use of AstraZeneca, including in countries where the South African variant of the coronavirus may reduce its efficacy. It said the vaccine should be given in two doses with an interval of 8 to 12 weeks, and should also be used in people aged 65 and older.
Even in countries such as South Africa, where questions have been raised about the AstraZeneca vaccine's efficacy against a newly-emerged variant of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, ""there is no reason not to recommend its use,"" SAGE chair Alejandro Cravioto had said on February 10.
Since AstraZeneca vaccines come in two doses each, Austriaco said, “We would need three doses of the remaining vaccines because you'd need one booster shot just for the B1351 variant.”While he didn’t disclose it during the press conference, Austriaco is part of a team developing another vaccine. In an interview with CNN Philippines in early February, he said he would be in the United States to conduct experiments on a yeast-based oral vaccine against COVID-19.

The country is expecting up to 9 million doses to be delivered from COVAX in the first quarter of 2021, and 17 million purchased by private sector and local governments by the second quarter of 2021.

President Rodrigo Duterte's approval is needed since Philippine auditing and procurement laws prohibit making advance payments
President Rodrigo Duterte has approved the Philippine government’s prepayment for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine, paving the way for the country’s access to the medicine expected to provide protection against the virus.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire announced this in a press briefing on Monday, November 23, saying, “Yes, I want to confirm that the President has already approved this prepayment.”
Vergeire added the final price for vaccines could not be disclosed until the deal was final since the government signed a confidentiality agreement with the company.
Duterte’s approval for the purchase is needed as Philippine auditing and procurement laws prohibit making advance payments for services and supplies not delivered yet.
Why this matters
The country’s pandemic officials earlier sought Duterte’s approval for advance payments for COVID-19 vaccines, which were necessary to secure supplies of doses once a viable vaccine becomes available.Unlike most other countries, the Philippines has been constrained in securing supplies for a vaccine as it could not easily make the necessary payment as commitment.Duterte’s special approval will be complemented by arrangements with the Asian Development Bank and other financing institutions, as well as big business groups that expressed willingness to handle advanced payments for the Philippines.Supplies ensured
Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez earlier said Pfizer was ready to supply the Philippines with doses of its vaccine once it was approved by local regulatory authorities.Still, most of the companies’ supplies produced this year will likely be given to the United States, which ordered 100 million doses of the vaccine for $1.95 billion.
Data from Phase 3 clinical trials showed that Pfizer’s vaccine prevented mild and severe forms of COVID-19, was 95% effective, and had no serious side effects. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.9891999959945679,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['president_rodrigo', 'duterte', 'approval', 'need', 'audit', 'procurement', 'law', 'prohibit', 'make', 'advance_payment', 'duterte', 'approve', 'government', 'prepayment', 'pfizer', 'pave', 'way', 'country', 'access', 'medicine', 'expect', 'provide', 'protection', 'virus', 'health', 'rosario_vergeire', 'announce', 'press_briefe', 'november', 'say', 'want', 'confirm', 'president', 'already', 'approve', 'prepayment', 'vergeire', 'add', 'final', 'price', 'vaccine', 'disclose', 'deal', 'final', 'government', 'sign', 'confidentiality', 'agreement', 'company', 'duterte', 'approval', 'purchase', 'need', 'audit', 'procurement', 'law', 'prohibit', 'make', 'advance_payment', 'service', 'supply', 'deliver', 'yet', 'matter', 'country', 'pandemic', 'official', 'early', 'seek', 'duterte', 'approval', 'advance_payment', 'vaccine', 'necessary', 'secure', 'supply', 'dose', 'viable', 'becomes_available', 'country', 'constrain', 'secure', 'supply', 'easily', 'make', 'necessary', 'payment', 'commitment', 'duterte', 'special', 'approval', 'complement', 'arrangement', 'asian_development', 'bank', 'financing', 'institution', 'well', 'big', 'business', 'group', 'expressed_willingness', 'handle', 'advanced', 'payment', 'supply', 'ensure', 'ambassador', 'united_state', 'early', 'say', 'pfizer', 'ready', 'supply', 'dose', 'approve', 'local', 'regulatory', 'authority', 'still', 'company', 'supply', 'produce', 'year', 'likely', 'give', 'united_state', 'order', 'dose', 'datum', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'show', 'pfizer', 'prevent', 'mild', 'severe', 'form', 'effective', 'serious_side', 'effect', 'com']",0.9878,0.015,0.718,0.266,0.6296918767507003,Positive

Carlito Galvez Jr, who is already pandemic national action plan chief implementer, is the 5th 'czar' in the government's COVID-19 response
President Rodrigo Duterte has assigned the role of ""vaccine czar"" to National Action Plan vs COVID-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr, Malacañang said on Monday, November 2.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque replied in the affirmative to reporters asking to clarify if Duterte's statements in a Super Typhoon Rolly (Goni) situationer meeting meant Galvez had been given the role.
""Pagbili ng bakuna, the negotiation, manufacture, production, or distribution, binigay ko 'yan kay Secretary Galvez,"" Duterte said during the meeting held at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse.
(For the purchase of a vaccine, negotiation, manufacture, production, or distribution, I've given it to Secretary Galvez.)
""Only Secretary Galvez is authorized to negotiate or whatever. Isa lang. Ayaw ko 'yang committee-committee. Matagal 'yan (Just one person. I don't like committees. They take too long.),"" the President said.
But despite Duterte's disdain for ""committees,"" his own coronavirus task forces are actually composed of a variety of task groups and technical working groups – groups of government officials representing relevant government agencies.
'Task group' on vaccine distribution
Last Thursday, October 29, the Inter-agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) created a structure that would manage and distribute COVID-19 vaccines once they become available to the Philippines.
The vaccine task group is to be led by the Department of Health. It's not clear how Galvez's new role as ""vaccine czar"" affects this arrangement. (READ: What we know about the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccine plans)
In the same meeting, Duterte expressed his preference for ""only one line of authority come from the task force.""
Galvez already has a leadership role in the government's pandemic efforts, being chief implementer of the national action plan.
His role is distinct from Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who heads the National Task Force vs COVID-19 (NTF), and Duque who heads the policy-making IATF-EID.
The 57-year-old Galvez served as chief of the military from April to December 2018. After his retirement, Duterte appointed him Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process.
Apart from Galvez, there are 4 other ""czars"" in the Duterte government's COVID-19 response – testing czar Vince Dizon, treatment czar Leopoldo Vega, tracing czar Benjamin Magalong, and isolation czar Mark Villar.
Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto had previously suggested that Duterte appoint a vaccine czar, given the expected challenges of vaccine distribution, including the likely need for a system of ultra-cold storage. – Rappler.com",Rappler,0.0,0.9650999903678894,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['already', 'pandemic', 'national', 'action', 'plan', 'czar', 'government', 'response', 'duterte', 'assign', 'role', 'czar', 'national', 'action', 'plan', 'malacanang', 'say', 'reply', 'affirmative', 'reporter', 'ask', 'clarify', 'duterte', 'statement', 'super', 'typhoon', 'rolly', 'goni', 'situationer', 'meeting', 'mean', 'galvez', 'give', 'role', 'pagbili', 'ng', 'bakuna', 'negotiation', 'manufacture', 'production', 'distribution', 'binigay', 'kay', 'secretary', 'galvez', 'duterte', 'say', 'meeting', 'hold', 'malacanang', 'golf', 'clubhouse', 'purchase', 'negotiation', 'manufacture', 'production', 'distribution', 've', 'give', 'secretary', 'galvez', 'secretary', 'galvez', 'authorize', 'negotiate', 'isa', 'lang', 'ayaw', 'committee', 'committee', 'matagal', 'person', 'do', 'committee', 'take', 'long', 'president', 'say', 'duterte', 'disdain', 'committee', 'coronavirus', 'task', 'force', 'actually', 'compose', 'variety', 'task', 'group', 'technical', 'work', 'group', 'group', 'government', 'official', 'represent', 'relevant', 'government', 'agency', 'task', 'group', 'distribution', 'last', 'thursday', 'inter_agency', 'eid', 'create', 'structure', 'manage', 'distribute', 'vaccine', 'become', 'available', 'task', 'group', 'lead', 'department', 'health', 'clear', 'galvezs', 'new', 'role', 'czar', 'affect', 'arrangement', 'read', 'know', 'plan', 'meeting', 'duterte', 'express', 'preference', 'line', 'authority', 'come', 'galvez', 'already', 'leadership', 'role', 'government', 'pandemic', 'effort', 'national', 'action', 'plan', 'role', 'distinct', 'defense', 'lorenzana', 'head', 'force', 'ntf', 'duque', 'head', 'policy', 'make', 'year', 'old', 'galvez', 'serve', 'chief', 'military', 'december', 'retirement', 'duterte', 'appoint', 'presidential_adviser', 'peace', 'process', 'apart', 'galvez', 'czar', 'duterte', 'government', 'response', 'testing', 'czar', 'vince_dizon', 'treatment', 'czar', 'leopoldo', 'vega', 'trace', 'czar', 'benjamin', 'magalong', 'isolation', 'czar', 'mark', 'villar', 'senate', 'president', 'pro', 'ralph', 'recto', 'previously', 'suggest', 'duterte', 'appoint', 'czar', 'give', 'expect', 'challenge', 'distribution', 'include', 'likely', 'need', 'system', 'ultra', 'cold_storage', 'com']",0.8126,0.026,0.902,0.072,0.3750199362041467,Positive

President Rodrigo Duterte says he made the plea with Chinese President Xi Jinping himself 4 days ago
As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread, President Rodrigo Duterte said he has pleaded with Chinese President Xi Jinping to prioritize the Philippines when providing an effective vaccine that would cure COVID-19.Duterte disclosed this during his 5th State of the Nation Address (SONA) on Monday, July 27, saying he “made a plea” to Xi 4 days ago.“Four days ago I made a plea to President Xi Jinping that if they have the vaccine, can they allow us to be one of the first – or if it's needed that we will have to buy it – that we will be granted credit so we can normalize as fast as possible,” Duterte said in his speech.Coronavirus cases have continued to increase in the Philippines with over 82,000 infected as of Monday. At the start of his speech, Duterte agonized over the “troubled times” the Philippines was experiencing due to the pandemic, pinning his hopes on a vaccine would be “around the corner.”Duterte had earlier spoken with Xi in a 20-minute phone call last June 11 where the Chinese President assured Duterte of China’s assistance in the coronavirus pandemic.
The Philippines is looking to start Phase 3 clinical trials for 5 vaccines in October 2020. Of the 5, 3 are candidate vaccines being developed in China.The global race for a vaccine was recently hit by controversy after the United State Justice Department accused a pair of Chinese hackers of attempting to steal vaccine research and hacking hundreds of companies in the US.The fallout has so far seen Washington order Beijing to close its consulate in Houston, escalating tensions between the two powers.Intelligence agencies in the US, United Kingdom, and Canada also warned hackers believed to be part of Russian intelligence were trying to steal information about a coronavirus vaccine, as reported by the Associated Press.

(UPDATED) Donated? Smuggled? And ordered by whom? As burning questions on early COVID-19 vaccinations linger, Malacañang wants to insist the issue is ‘over’ while health experts express alarm on its unregulated use.
While millions of Filipinos wait to receive a COVID-19 shot, the latest pandemic violation came in secret doses of an unregistered vaccine used on top government officials and members of President Rodrigo Duterte’s close-in security.The unregulated vaccination violated laws that assured the public safety of medicines, bewildering the government’s own health officials and leaving medical experts alarmed over its impact on forthcoming immunization efforts seeking to end the public health emergency.After all, the success of vaccination programs, the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) pointed out, “hinged on mutual trust between the public and institutions.” It’s a lesson the Department of Health knows painfully well, after the tainted Dengvaxia immunization program left public health programs in pieces.But while the country still lacks an approved vaccine against the disease, this has not stopped other public officials from deciding on their own which vaccine to use and on whom – an authority reserved for regulatory and medical experts.It was no less than President Rodrigo Duterte who revealed the day after Christmas that vaccines were already given to some people in government.“Sabihin ko, marami na magpa-injection dito sa Sinopharm (I’ll say it, many here have been injected with Sinopharm)…. I have to be frank, I have to tell the truth,” Duterte claimed, leaving his men to make sense of the searing issue. Now faced with public backlash for the selective vaccinations, Malacañang would have the public just “accept” these took place. “Tapos na po ang usapan na 'yan (That issue is over),” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said.But the Palace’s attempts to end the issue failed to explain how the unregulated immunization efforts took place.Rappler lists 5 critical questions left unanswered by the Duterte government.Who received a vaccine?
Regulatory bodies across the world have granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines because these are still considered to be in the development phase. That means strict monitoring is needed to document all information on its use and watch out for possible side effects.Without details of who received a vaccine, health authorities cannot implement proper surveillance.
The President may have divulged that soldiers were among those who received a vaccine but it was Interior Secretary Eduardo Año who later detailed that those inoculated belonged to the Presidential Security Guard (PSG). The Armed Forces of the Philippines at first declined to name which unit the soldiers belonged to, but later confirmed that it was indeed the PSG.This prompted PSG Commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante to speak up on the matter, saying members of the President’s close-in security were given a vaccine as a necessary and “courageous” step that would assure Duterte’s safety.“We are in a state of war; a war against COVID-19. War compels us to survive as what we are now doing in this pandemic. As such, PSG exploits all means in order to deliver its mandate as what is highly expected of them by the Filipino people,” Durante said in an official statement.Año had also disclosed that at least one Cabinet official benefited from the early vaccination but declined to name the official out of “privacy.”As the Philippines faces the mammoth challenge of procuring scarce supply of vaccines, jabs given to these select individuals fall out of line in the government’s own target list of priority groups – the first of whom were frontline health workers tending to coronavirus patients.DUTERTE CABINET.

Did Duterte sanction the vaccination?
Malacañang has defended the issue by arguing that it was not unlawful for people to receive an unregistered vaccine. But what of those who brought the vaccines into the Philippines?The question over who ordered unapproved vaccines to be used will point to those who can be sanctioned for circumventing the government’s own rules. Unauthorized immunizations violate the Food and Drug Administration Act which prohibits the manufacture, importation, sale, distribution, transfer, and use of unregistered health products, among others.What’s clear for now is that officials either “do not know,” have refused to name, or clashed on who directed the vaccination.
On December 28, the first Monday after Duterte opened the blistering issue, Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana said the vaccination of soldiers followed the chain of command.“Of course, our President is our commander-in-chief of the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines). I should say it's from the chain of command of the Armed Forces,” he told DWIZ when asked if the decision came from Malacañang or the AFP.But in a virtual press briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque threw it back to the military, saying the decision “must have been made” by them since vaccines would not reach soldiers without the go-signal of commanders.Overnight, statements would continue to change and take shape. Asked to comment on the Army’s remarks, Roque said he was not aware of what the Armed Forces claimed. “They must be privy to that information, I am not,” he said, adding he did not interfere with what could involve “national security.”
On the side of health officials, FDA Director General Enrique Domingo told media he was not aware of who made the decision to have soldiers vaccinated and that Health Secretary Francisco Duque III seemed to be in the dark too.“I spoke to Secretary (Duque), nagulat din po siya (he was also surprised),” Domingo said.The FDA chief was careful to answer questions that “speculated” on who was responsible, instead seeking to wait on more information from a probe the agency had launched. He doubted Duterte sanctioned the unregulated immunization, saying, “Hindi naman po siguro galing sa pangulo iyon ano” (That probably didn’t come from the President.)
The statement again changed when Durante said in an interview on ANC on Saturday, December 30, that the PSG did its own research on what vaccine to use for its unit. They did not ask permission from Duterte who was supposedly told only after the fact, he said.By December 30, Durante said he was taking ""full responsibility"" over the PSG's use of an unapproved vaccine, that it was done ""independently,"" and no one convinced them do it. ""We vaccinated ourselves. It's so easy,"" he said.

RTVM SCREENSHOT
Which vaccines were used and how were doses brought into the country?
Duterte cited Sinopharm in his speech where he revealed the early vaccinations, but details on this were left out by his officials as the issue unfolded over the next few days.Domingo said that among the questions FDA’s probe seeks to answer include exactly what vaccine was used as well as the current status of the immunization activities. The investigation on this would take a “few days,” he added.Durante did not want to cite what vaccine was used, nor the source it came from since this could threaten the government’s procurement efforts. He only described the shot as “one of the safest” and “very traditional.”But how did it enter the Philippines in the first place, without the knowledge of the FDA that would clear it?Bureau of Customs Assistant Commissioner and spokesperson Philip Vincent Maronilla said the agency was clueless as well. The vaccine used by Duterte’ security and top officials of the government, he added, had no official papers.Maronilla told DZBB that when Customs officials reviewed their records in “so far as vaccines brought in for the use of general public,” no instructions involving the matter had been given to them. He said if the vaccines are proven smuggled, officials involved could face administrative and civil cases.
According to Roque, the vaccines were given as a donation. He even categorized them as “tokens” and likened the extremely scarce item to a birthday cake that personnel from his office gave him, sidestepping a reporter's question if it could be considered corruption for receiving the valuable donation.
If this was so, who did it come from? “Hindi ko po alam (I don’t know), Roque said. “Kung ano po ang sinabi ng aking amo, iyon lang po (Whatever my boss has said, that's it). I cannot add, I cannot subtract.”If the vaccines were indeed given as a donation, Domingo said this still would have gone through the DOH’s Bureau of International Health Cooperation which coordinates with the FDA for the clearance of donated health products under normal circumstances. Government regulations likewise apply to official COVID-19 donations coming from foreign entities which undergo the verification process.Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the vaccines were indeed smuggled as it was unauthorized, but that it was “justified” since it is meant to protect the President. The defense chief said he did not know the source of the vaccines used and admitted he didn’t know how the smuggling issue “will be resolved” as the PSG violated FDA rules.
While Durante took the heat for the issue, he still did not disclose where or whom the doses were sourced from.

Why were health officials not consulted?
If the concern was to secure the President’s safety, was it enough to warrant bypassing the government’s own health officials?
The government’s own coronavirus task force formed a unique panel of vaccine experts under the Department of Science and Technology that was created specially to review potential COVID-19 vaccines.
The separate entity was supposed to provide an added layer of safety in evaluating vaccines developed during unprecedented circumstances, on top of an ad hoc group of experts at the FDA who were tapped as part of the process of issuing emergency use authorization.
Domingo said the DOH and the FDA – among the lead agencies in the vaccination efforts – had not been consulted on the use of a COVID-19 vaccine on PSG soldiers and top government officials.The agency was firm in its stand that the public should not be vaccinated yet because there are no registered vaccines subjected to FDA review.

FDA's balancing act: Probing unregistered vaccine used on soldiers, officials
How did it bypass FDA approval?
Even by Duterte’s own orders, a COVID-19 vaccine should have gone through proper regulatory processes before it could be used, let alone brought into the Philippines.The Chief Executive granted the FDA authority to issue special EUAs for the very purpose of ensuring timely access to safe COVID-19 medicines while the pandemic raged.Why the exception for a vaccine used by select officials?“I am as confused as you. I am also as bewildered because there is a process, there is a way for us to make sure that we can get the most amount of certainty when it comes to safety and efficacy of a vaccine,” Domingo said in an interview with ABS-CBN on December 28.In a separate briefing, he told reporters, “The fact is, there is no registered COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines at this time.”
If it was Sinopharm that was used, Roque downplayed the unknown risks, referring to China’s EUA for the vaccine and its use on hundreds of thousands outside traditional testing processes.Experts from HPAAC, the largest coalition of medical and health societies in the country, pointed out that an EUA from one country does not extend authority beyond its borders. Moreover, there is more to vaccines than simply receiving them.“Even if a vaccine is approved in other countries, its storage, transport, and distribution are complex procedures. Improper handling can damage vaccines and can render them useless,” the group said. “This is why distribution channels and processes need to be transparent and regulated.”
HPAAC counts among its member groups medical societies that earlier warned that the Philippines needed to recalibrate its response to the pandemic or see the country's health system overwhelmed. It counts some of the country's top medical experts and doctors as members.
What the law says
Each lapse that occurred in the unregulated vaccination of government workers raises the prospect that several laws have been violated.For the importation, distribution, and administration of an unregulated vaccine, the FDA Act of 2009 imposes a penalty of imprisonment and stiff fines that could reach millions of pesos.As it slipped pass health and Customs officials, those responsible for smuggling vaccines could face administrative and civil cases. The same goes for a “donation” of the coveted vaccine, which did not pass through proper government channels and may be subject to the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.On Monday, January 4, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra issued a written order directing the National Bureau of Investigation to probe the use of smuggled vaccines in the country.Guevarra did not zero in on the PSG but said it was important that laws on vaccine approval and administration were ""strictly observed for the benefit of everyone.""Aside from the FDA Act, Guevarra said the NBI is looking into possible violations of the Medical Practice Act of 1959 which holds liable individuals who “knowingly or willfully administer an unregistered vaccine.”While questions remain unanswered, among the casualties of the issue initially kept under wraps are frontliners and essential workers who have been told that they would be the first to receive the vaccine.The health department tried to assuage concerns.

Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire vowed: “One thing I can say to the public, please do not worry. We will still follow the priority groups listed to receive the vaccine. Our priority to have healthcare workers be the first, the vulnerable groups, the frontliners – all of this will be followed when the vaccine that we procure and register arrives in the country.”
She asserted, “Our prioritization will not be changed or revised.” – Rappler.com",Rappler,4.0,0.5527999997138977,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also,

Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin says the countries are ‘turning anti-epidemic cooperation into a new highlight in bilateral relations’
China has vowed to prioritize the Philippines’ request for a coronavirus vaccine after President Rodrigo Duterte said in his 5th State of the Nation (SONA) that he pleaded with Chinese President Xi Jinping to place Manila as priority.“The Philippines is a friendly close neighbor and we will give priority to its needs once we succeed in developing a vaccine,” Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing on Tuesday, July 28.Duterte had also earlier spoken with Xi in a 20-minute phone call last June 11 where the Chinese President assured Duterte of China’s assistance in the coronavirus pandemic.On Tuesday, Wang reiterated Xi’s assurance, saying “Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China and the Philippines have been standing together with mutual assistance, turning anti-epidemic cooperation into a new highlight in bilateral relations.”Who gets a vaccine first?
With scientists around the world racing to find a cure to the coronavirus, experts warned of “vaccine nationalism” – or a “my country first” approach toward allocating vaccines. (READ: Why Duterte shouldn’t just wait for a vaccine from China)
In a Foreign Affairs article, analysts Thomas Bollyky and Chad Bown said that without global coordination or an “international, enforceable commitment” to distribute vaccines equitably, low- and middle-income countries will have a harder time gaining access to a long-awaited cure.“Supplies of proven vaccines will be limited initially even in some rich countries, but the greatest suffering will be in low- and middle-income countries. Such places will be forced to watch as their wealthier counterparts deplete supplies and will have to wait months (or longer) for their replenishment,” they said.The analysts likewise raised insights of Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, who told the Wall Street Journal he expects China to use its vaccines “predominantly for the large populace of China.” China counts 1.4 billion people among its population, one of the largest in the world.Earlier in the pandemic, international relations observers noted that as the number of new coronavirus cases were decreasing in China – ground zero of the novel coronavirus – the country gained room to focus more resources on providing aid to other countries affected by the disease.In ramping up foreign assistance, however, experts noted that China's efforts were a way to deflect criticism over its handling of coronavirus cases in the crucial early days of the outbreak. The Philippines is looking to start Phase 3 clinical trials for 5 vaccines by October 2020. These include 3 candidate vaccines being developed in China.

'Wala kaming pakialam kung ano ang pipiliin 'nyo,' says the Philippine Chief Executive
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the national government will not tie down mayors and governors in choosing a particular COVID-19 vaccine for their constituents.
""I'm now addressing the mayors and governors, you can choose any vaccine you like to buy. Wala kaming pakialam kung ano ang pipiliin 'nyo (We don't care which one you'll choose),"" he said on Wednesday, January 13, during a meeting with pandemic task force officials at the Malacañang Golf Clubhouse.
His promise comes amid successive announcements of cities signing deals with British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca for hundreds of thousands of vaccine doses.
Duterte later on clarified that local governments would still have to choose from the COVID-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a national government agency.
""Maraming local government units who opted to go on their own. Sila ang magbili, may pera sila, and sila ang mamili ng kanilang vaccine.... And they insist to be given the freedom to choose because may pera sila,"" said Duterte.
(Many local government units opted to go on their own. They will buy because they have money, and they want to choose their vaccine.... And they insist to be given the freedom to choose because they have money.)
He then said the national government is ""not forcing"" any local government to adopt the vaccines to be patronized by the national government.
Chinese vs Western vaccines?
While local governments had signed deals with AstraZeneca, a few like Davao City, led by Duterte's daughter Sara, are also in talks with Chinese firm Sinovac.
The national government, however, has just signed a deal with Sinovac for 25 million doses of its vaccine, CoronaVac.
Duterte defended Chinese-made vaccines in the same meeting, saying they are ""as good"" as American- or European-made ones.
The Philippine leader has long expressed a preference for Chinese or Russian vaccines, with Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque even saying last Monday, January 11, that if Duterte had his way, he would get injected with both a Chinese and Russian vaccine.
The newly-signed Sinovac agreement means the Philippines has secured supplies of 3 vaccines – those of Sinovac, Novavax, and AstraZeneca – so far.
However, the FDA is yet to approve any vaccine for emergency use. Of the 3 secured vaccines, only AstraZeneca has applied for emergency use approval as of this writing. – Rappler.com",Rappler,4.0,0.8167999982833862,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['wala', 'kame', 'pipiliin', 'nyo', 'say', 'duterte', 'say', 'national', 'government', 'tie', 'mayor', 'governor', 'choose', 'particular', 'constituent', 'm', 'address', 'mayor', 'governor', 'choose', 'buy', 'wala', 'kame', 'pipiliin', 'nyo', 'do', 'nt', 'care', 'choose', 'say', 'january', 'meeting', 'pandemic', 'official', 'malacanang', 'golf', 'clubhouse', 'promise', 'come', 'successive', 'announcement', 'city', 'sign', 'deal', 'pharmaceutical_firm', 'astrazeneca', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'dose', 'duterte', 'later', 'clarify', 'local_government', 'still', 'choose', 'vaccine', 'approve', 'food', 'national', 'government', 'agency', 'marame', 'local', 'government', 'unit', 'opt', 'go', 'ang', 'magbili', 'pera', 'sila', 'ang', 'mamili', 'ng', 'kanilang', 'insist', 'give', 'freedom', 'choose', 'pera', 'say', 'many', 'local', 'government', 'unit', 'opt', 'go', 'buy', 'money', 'want', 'choose', 'insist', 'give', 'freedom', 'choose', 'money', 'say', 'national', 'government', 'force', 'local', 'government', 'adopt', 'vaccine', 'patronize', 'national', 'government', 'chinese', 'western', 'vaccine', 'local_government', 'sign', 'deal', 'astrazeneca', 'lead', 'duterte', 'daughter', 'sara', 'also', 'talk', 'chinese', 'firm', 'sinovac', 'national', 'government', 'however', 'sign', 'deal', 'dose', 'coronavac', 'duterte', 'defend', 'chinese', 'make', 'vaccine', 'meeting', 'say', 'good', 'american', 'european', 'make', 'one', 'leader', 'long', 'express', 'preference', 'chinese', 'russian', 'vaccine', 'even', 'say', 'last', 'january', 'duterte', 'way', 'get', 'inject', 'chinese', 'russian', 'newly', 'sign', 'sinovac', 'agreement', 'mean', 'secure', 'supply', 'vaccine', 'sinovac', 'novavax', 'astrazeneca', 'far', 'however', 'yet', 'approve', 'secure', 'vaccine', 'astrazeneca', 'apply', 'approval', 'writing', 'com']",0.9834,0.0,0.836,0.164,0.22568181818181818,Positive

The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 warns that allowing for such a setup could severely impact public health safety and lead to the inequitable rollout of vaccines in the Philippines
Several of the Philippines' top health experts on Thursday, February 11, opposed lawmakers' efforts to push for bills that would allow local government units (LGUs) to buy coronavirus vaccines directly from manufacturers.
The Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 (HPAAC) – the largest coalition of health groups in the country – warned that proposed measures seeking to grant LGUs this authority could severely impact the public health safety and rollout of vaccines in the country.It could also create unequal access to limited shots throughout the country, with prioritization of the coveted good defined by access to funds and the capacity to pay, instead of need based on exposure and risk to COVID-19.""This is not about money but justice – social justice,"" said Dr Aileen Espina, a public health and family medicine specialist, during a press conference on Thursday night.
Internal medicine specialist and epidemiologist Dr Antonio Dans, along with Dr Inday Dans, pediatrician and clinical epidemiologist, said the group was strongly opposed to the possible passage of Senate Bill No. 2042 filed by Senate Majority Leader Miguel Zubiri last February 8.
Dans appealed to lawmakers and Zubiri to reconsider the bill, saying it would impact the public's trust in the government's COVID-19 vaccination program.""This will impact public trust greatly, not just when it comes to effectiveness of vaccines but in their trust that no one will be left behind, people will be treated equally, and the country will move forward together,"" Dans said in Filipino.While the group focused on SB 2042, similar measures had been filed at the House of Representatives by Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez, House Minority Leader Stephen Paduano, as well as Quirino Representative Junie Cua.
The bigger picture
Lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have been pushing for measures that would allow LGUs and the private sector to buy vaccines directly from manufacturers, without the oversight of national government.
They argued that allowing for such purchase schemes would speed up access to vaccines in the country. This comes after they criticized the national government's supposed ""monopoly"" over purchase deals that hampered Filipinos' access to COVID-19 shots.
But health experts opposed such measures for 3 main reasons:First, that it would bypass the required recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC), which is mandated to review medical technology eyed for use in a public health program. The HTAC, created by the Universal Health Care Law, reviews the feasibility and cost-efficiency of health technology like vaccines for public use, as well as potential commercial or political conflicts of interest.
Second, it would lead to ""maldistribution"" of vaccines, where richer LGUs with the capacity to pay would get priority access to already limited vaccines, leaving poorer communities further behind.Third, patchwork purchasing of vaccines, as opposed to centralized purchase through the national government, would escalate vaccine prices ""because the country will lose the scale or volume that one buyer has.""
Dans said the HTAC's recommendation guaranteed public safety of vaccines as the group of independent scientists continuously reviewed vaccines to balance ""benefit, harm, and cost” that may shift quickly, ""even overnight,"" as more information on COVID-19 and vaccines were shared.
This recommendation is separate from the Food and Drug Administration's issuance of emergency approval, which focused only on the safety and efficacy of a vaccine.""Bypassing recommendations of this council will expose the people to the dangers of inappropriate technology, and may make local policy makers liable for wrong decisions,"" he said.Allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines on their own would also hamper goals of a vaccine program to reduce mortality and maintain healthcare capacity. They stressed that since supplies worldwide are limited, scarce shots should be given to those who need it most across the country: healthcare workers, elderly, and people with comorbidities.
Dans said: ""If there was no lack of vaccines, it would be acceptable, but with limited supplies, the scarce vaccines should be give to those who need it the most.... One problem of the pandemic is the poor are always shortchanged.""

Granting LGUs the authority to buy vaccines on their own could also threaten proper allocation of funds, as the HPAAC pointed out that nearly half of the cost of immunization programs is spent on actually implementing the rollout of vaccines.
With doses already severely limited worldwide and developed countries having access to majority of vaccines produced, the HPAAC said allowing LGUs to purchase vaccines directly from manufacturers may see the same scenario of unequal distribution take place locally.""We aggravate this inequity by doing the same thing locally – distributing geographically according to capacity to pay. When this happens, we all suffer, not just those whom we push to the end of the queue,"" the group said.Dans said the group had presented its position to lawmakers at the Senate, but that discussions indicated preference for the bill to be passed despite its possible negative impact on the country's COVID-19 vaccination program.What works now
The HPAAC appealed to lawmakers to keep the current scheme where LGUs and the private sector buy vaccines along with the national government, since this would assure equal distribution and continuous safety.This setup would also comply with the FDA's conditions for use under an emergency use authorization (EUA), which allows for its public use under strict conditions.
While the proposed bills in Congress mentioned LGUs could only buy vaccines that have been granted an EUA by the FDA, the HPAAC pointed out that an EUA was still different from securing full marketing authority necessary to commercialize the vaccine and allow its sale in the market.Current purchase schemes involving LGUs and the private sector take the form of tripartite deals where the national government, through the National Task Force against COVID-19, signs deals with vaccine manufacturers and either LGUs or business groups.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr had told lawmakers during previous congressional hearings that this allowed for LGUs and the private sector to take part in vaccine procurement – something unique to the Philippines, as vaccine manufacturers have so far preferred to deal directly with national governments only.According to Galvez, tripartite deals allow the Philippines to meet this condition of vaccine companies which they observed with all countries, especially as supplies of vaccines remain severely limited.
Galvez had also earlier told senators that allowing LGUs and private groups to directly buy COVID-19 vaccines was not yet possible. This was because ""no company"" would engage in deals that did not involve national governments of other countries, which have only been granting emergency use approvals to COVID-19 vaccines. –

FDA Director General Eric Domingo also warns against supposed coronavirus vaccines that are being sold in the market, saying that these vaccines should not be promoted unless they are FDA-approved
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo announced on Friday, October 30, that Chinese company Clover Biopharmaceuticals has applied to conduct clinical trials for the coronavirus vaccine in the country.
(Editor's note: An earlier version of this report referred to Clover Biopharmaceuticals as an Australian company. This has been corrected.)
In a virtual press briefing on Friday morning, Domingo said that Clover has submitted its clinical trials data to the vaccine expert panel (VEP) for evaluation.
Domingo said he could not give more details about Clover as he only knew about its intent on Friday.
To date, at at least 3 companies expressed interest in conducting Phase 3 clinical trials in the Philippines. Under such trials, a vaccine is given to hundreds of people split into different age groups.
Aside from Clover, health officials cited China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Sputnik V among candidate vaccines that could possibly see independent trials in the country.For Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine, the VEP is still evaluating data from phases 1 and 2 of its clinical trials. According to the New York Times’ vaccine tracker, this vaccine is a ""combination of two adenoviruses, Ad5 and Ad26, both engineered with a coronavirus gene.""
As for Sinovac, the VEP has endorsed this to the FDA. Domingo said the agency is anticipating the submission of its application for Phase 3 trials after it gets the endorsement of the ethics board.Clinical trials are a type of research that evaluates potential medical interventions that affect one's health. During trials, medicines, treatments, procedures, and devices may be tested to study or verify their clinical or pharmacological effects before they are approved for public use.

In the Philippines, the FDA is the body tasked with regulating clinical trials.Domingo said that to date, no company has been given approval to conduct clinical trials in the country.

Illegal COVID-19 vaccines
During Friday's briefing, Domingo also warned the public against supposed coronavirus vaccines that are being sold in the market. He added that while the Philippines and other countries are doing clinical trials, these vaccines should not be promoted in the market unless they already secured FDA approval.
""We have to remember that even though may clinical trials na kahit na nagki-clinical trials na ang produkto sa Pilipinas at sa ibang bansa (there are clinical trials for products being done in the Philippines and other countries), and they are not registered, they cannot be promoted in the market as safe and effective, and definitely, they cannot be sold,"" Domingo said.
This came after reports that there have been Chinese advertisements promoting COVID-19 vaccines priced at P50,000.
""Ang puwede lang magamit ng madla ay 'yung mga rehistrado lang ng FDA (The public can only use those that are FDA-registered),"" Domingo stressed. – Rappler.com",Rappler,1.0,0.7419000267982483,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['fda', 'also', 'warn', 'suppose', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'sell', 'market', 'say', 'vaccine', 'promote', 'approve', 'food', 'fda', 'announce', 'chinese', 'company', 'clover', 'apply', 'conduct', 'clinical_trial', 'coronavirus', 'country', 'editor', 'note', 'early', 'version', 'report', 'refer', 'clover', 'australian', 'company', 'correct', 'briefing', 'morning', 'say', 'clover', 'submit', 'clinical_trial', 'datum', 'vep', 'evaluation', 'domingo', 'say', 'give', 'detail', 'clover', 'know', 'intent', 'friday', 'date', 'least', 'company', 'expressed_interest', 'conduct', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'trial', 'give', 'hundred', 'people', 'split', 'different', 'age', 'group', 'clover', 'health', 'official', 'cite', 'china', 'sinovac', 'russia', 'sputnik', 'candidate', 'vaccine', 'possibly', 'see', 'independent', 'trial', 'country', 'russia', 'still', 'evaluate', 'datum', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'accord', 'time', 'tracker', 'combination', 'adenovirus', 'ad', 'ad', 'engineer', 'coronavirus', 'gene', 'sinovac', 'endorse', 'say', 'agency', 'anticipate', 'submission', 'application', 'phase', 'trial', 'get', 'endorsement', 'clinical_trial', 'type', 'research', 'evaluate', 'potential', 'medical', 'intervention', 'affect', 'one', 'health', 'trial', 'medicine', 'treatment', 'procedure', 'device', 'test', 'study', 'verify', 'clinical', 'pharmacological', 'effect', 'approve', 'public', 'use', 'read', 'know', 'plan', 'body', 'task', 'regulating', 'clinical_trial', 'say', 'date', 'company', 'give', 'approval', 'conduct', 'clinical_trial', 'country', 'screenshot', 'domingo', 'presentation', 'illegal', 'vaccine', 'friday', 'briefing', 'domingo', 'also', 'warn', 'public', 'suppose', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'sell', 'market', 'add', 'country', 'clinical_trial', 'vaccine', 'promote', 'market', 'already', 'secure', 'approval', 'remember', 'even', 'kahit', 'na', 'clinical_trial', 'na', 'ang', 'ibang', 'clinical_trial', 'product', 'do', 'country', 'register', 'promote', 'market', 'safe', 'effective', 'definitely', 'sell', 'domingo', 'say', 'come', 'report', 'chinese', 'advertisement', 'promote', 'vaccine', 'price', 'ang', 'ng', 'madla', 'yung', 'mga', 'rehistrado', 'lang', 'ng', 'public', 'use', 'register', 'domingo', 'stress', 'com']",0.9686,0.039,0.826,0.135,0.3625,Positive

The government allocates the first tranche of Pfizer vaccines for hospital-based healthcare workers
The Philippine pandemic task force has included persons with comorbidities in its list of priority groups for COVID-19 vaccination. Teachers and social workers, meanwhile, have been placed in the 2nd tier of prioritization.
The new list was made public on Friday, February 5, by Presidential Spokesman and task force spokesman Harry Roque.
The list was formulated by the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG), a team of health experts advising the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases.
Here is the new list:
A1: Frontline workers in health facilities both national and local, private and public, health professionals and non-professionals like students, nursing aides, janitors, barangay health workers, etc.
A2: Senior citizens aged 60 years old and aboveA3: Persons with comorbidities not otherwise included in the preceding categoriesA4: Frontline personnel in essential sectors including uniformed personnel and those in working sectors identified by the IATF as essential during ECQA5: Indigent population not otherwise included in the preceding categories
B1: Teachers, social workersB2: Other government workersB3: Other essential workersB4: Socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigent peopleB5: Overseas Filipino WorkersB6: Other remaining workforceC: Rest of the Filipino population not otherwise included in the above groups
Health workers to get Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine
The task force also said it is allocating the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, expected to arrive this month, for health frontliners.
The first tranche will be given to frontliners in the following health facilities:
COVID-19 dedicated hospitals
COVID-19 referral hospitals
Hospitals owned by the Department of Health
Local government hospitals
Hospitals for uniformed services or personnel
Private hospitals
The Pfizer vaccines arriving in February are coming in through the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility. The Philippines was able to qualify for the mechanism's early vaccine roll-out, intended to give developing countries affordable, equitable access to COVID-19 jabs.
Changing minds
In the first priority list released to the public, persons with comorbidities were not in the first tier of the list, which was dominated by health frontliners, senior citizens, and indigent Filipinos.
The World Health Organization has identified those with heart or lung disease, diabetes, or conditions affecting their immune system as ""high-risk"" because they are more likely to experience a severe COVID-19 infection.
Some members of the task force, including Roque, had argued for including persons with comorbidities but the idea was initially thumbed down.
""The other camp was saying, anyway most senior citizens with comorbidities already have priority,"" said Roque last January 11.
But another reason given for not including persons with comorbidities is that it would supposedly allow more people a chance to skip the line.
""There was some discussion because some are mistrustful, that it might be a loophole used by some to get ahead, even if they don't have [comorbidities],"" said Roque.
Meanwhile, the new list does not include families of military personnel, despite President Rodrigo Duterte's promise in a speech in front of soldiers in Sulu.
Prioritization based on area
The task force, meanwhile, said it would prioritize geographic areas that have both high transmission rates and readiness to roll out vaccines.
The criteria is as follows:
COVID-19 burden of disease (current active cases, attack rate per 100,000 population in the past 4 weeks, population density)
readiness of local government unit or vaccination site, particularly its supply chain capability

'But somebody dropped the ball,' tweets Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr
As the Philippines struggles to secure enough doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr said on Tuesday, December 15, that an offer was made to secure the country 10 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine for as early as January 2021.But the arrangement supposedly fell through, Locsin said, as “somebody dropped the ball” on the possible purchase of the vaccine facilitated by Locsin and Philippine Ambassador to the United State Jose “Babe” Romualdez with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.“That said my thanks just the same to US Sec of State Mike Pompeo we – Babe Romualdez and I – got 10 million doses of Pfizer financed by World Bank and ADB to be shipped thru FEDEX to Clark in January. But somebody dropped the ball,” Locsin tweeted on Tuesday.Locsin did not disclose further details when asked who was responsible for the missed opportunity. The foreign affairs chief instead said Philippine vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr was already ordering doses of Pfizer’s vaccine, which has been the first to be used in countries that have started their mass vaccination campaigns against the disease.In a briefing at Malacañang earlier on Tuesday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said he had “no idea” who Locsin was referring to.Despite this, Roque denied the government failed to act early in securing supplies of Pfizer’s vaccine, citing as proof Locsin’s negotiations with Pompeo.“Alam ko po maaga pa nakipag-negotiate na po si Secretary Locsin dahil naaalala ko po iyang meeting na iyan pero maagang-maaga pa po in 2020 nakipag-negotiate na po si Secretary Locsin. Hindi lang nakipag-negotiate, nakipagkasundo pa na bibigyan tayo ng Amerika ng Pfizer,” Roque said.(I know Secretary Locsin negotiated earlier on since I remember that meeting and it was early in 2020 when Secretary Locisn was negotiating. Not just negotiating, but had agreed that America would give us Pfizer vaccines.)
Locsin likewise brushed aside notion the Philippines failed to act fast enough to secure supplies of a vaccine.“No. We did not miss the bus because we were slow to act. Babe and I were fast. Offers poured in. But there are none so slow as those who never had the intention to catch the bus,” he said.While negotiations were ongoing between Pfizer officials and the government, no purchase of a specific number of doses have been announced. Galvez earlier said the country remained in talks with the company but declined to give details as it was now covered by a confidentiality agreement.Health officials earlier said President Rodrigo Duterte approved the government’s pre-payment for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine.MUST READ

'Requirements and standard agreements are common to all countries. They're not specific to the Philippines, and they are not related to...Dengvaxia,' says WHO Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.
World Health Organization (WHO) Philippines Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe denied the Philippines was being asked for specific requirements in its indemnification agreement with vaccine firm Pfizer due to the Dengvaxia dengue controversy.This is contrary to claims made by vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr who earlier said that arrest warrants issued in relation to the Dengvaxia scandal in the Philippines impacted the government’s negotiation efforts with manufacturers.Galvez attributed the delay in vaccine procurement to the Dengvaxia issue. He told reporters, “The situation changed. We have to understand. What happened with the warrants of arrest for Sanofi, it has great implications on our procurement, really.” He added that the arrest warrants announced last February 1 “changed everything.”But In a virtual briefing on Tuesday, February 23, Abeyasinghe clarified the Philippines was instead asked to sign onto a “standard” indemnification agreement similar to those presented to different countries receiving the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.“Let me clarify that the requirements and standard agreements are common to all countries. They're not specific to the Philippines, and they are not related to any issue that happened in the country relating to Dengvaxia or anything else,” he said when asked if the Philippines was being asked for special indemnity requirements.
Abeyasinghe made the statement after the rollout of the Philippines’ COVID-19 vaccination had been delayed due to paperwork on indemnification agreements required by manufacturers as vaccines are still under emergency use authorization worldwide.The Philippines earlier targeted to start its vaccination campaign by February 2021, with initial doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine supplied by the WHO’s COVAX facility.What's the status of delivery now?
Abeyasinghe said the issues raised between Pfizer and the Philippine government included the need for an indemnification law in the Philippines as well as “several minor clauses” in a letter detailing indemnification requirements.Philippine lawmakers were seeking to address the need for legislation on indemnification with the passage of bills creating an indemnification fund for adverse events following immunization. The House of Representatives passed its version of the measure on Monday, February 23, while the Senate passed a counterpart bill on Tuesday.As to requirements listed in a letter between the Philippines and Pfizer, the WHO said Philippine officials received documents on these details Tuesday morning.“So maybe today or tomorrow we will see a resolution of that impasse and maybe there'll be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe said.As for initial AstraZeneca doses coming from the COVAX facility, Abeyasinghe said the Department of Health had supplied “all letters necessary” to access supplies part of an early rollout of the vaccine. AstraZeneca, he added, did not require a further exchange of letters on the indemnification requirement.Abeyasinghe said the WHO remained optimistic it would pin down an initial date of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine for the Philippines this week with doses to be sourced from those manufactured in South Korea.Both Pfizer and AstraZeneca have secured emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration with first doses to be given to frontline health workers in 32 hospitals across Manila, along with two more in Cebu City and Davao City.As more countries across the region started the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines among their populations, health workers and local officials tasked with distributing vaccines said they were ready to start vaccinating people by the government’s targeted February rollout.

Kumaran said discussions are ongoing as Bharat Biotech awaits emergency use authorization (EUA) for Covaxin, its COVID-19 vaccine, from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

“There are ongoing conversations for a supply for Covaxin which can range anywhere from 8 million doses upwards. I don’t think we are in a position to be signing anything yet,” he said in an ANC interview.

Kumaran clarified that formal negotiations have not yet begun as Bharat Biotech only submitted its Phase 3 clinical trial data to the FDA on Tuesday.

“The company has had one or two presentations with the FDA, but the commercial negotiations, which involve signing of a term sheet and then eventually moving to a contract, those are still pending,” he said.

“Once we close the contract, the nature of the vaccine requires at least 45 days for the production to be completed. We could look at 8 to 20 million over the next year and a half, but how much of that will come early is actually the big question,” he added.

Bharat Biotech filed an application for EUA on January 21.

Covaxin showed 81% efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19.

The FDA has so far granted EUA to the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac.—AOL, GMA News

The vaccine was administered by Nurse Chareluck Santos.
“Si Dr. Legaspi ang nanguna sa atin sa laban na ito kaya karapat-dapat lang na siya ang unang tumanggap ng ating bakuna,” PGH spokesperson Dr. Jonas Del Rosario said.

Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also received a shot of Sinovac's vaccine at the PGH.
The ceremony -- one among several symbolic vaccinations scheduled within the day -- was held in a bid to boost public confidence in the vaccination program in light of polls showing low trust in vaccines.  
Several government officials, including Food and Drug Administration (FDA) chief Eric Domingo and testing czar Secretary Vince Dizon also received the Sinovac shot. Dizon received his at Tala Hospital (Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium) in Caloocan City.
Under the vaccination priority list, frontline workers in health facilities should be the first to get inoculated. 
The “symbolic” vaccination followed the arrival of 600,000 Sinovac doses on Sunday afternoon. 
The first batch of vaccines will be rolled out to several hospitals in Metro Manila also on Monday, marking a turning point in the country’s battle against COVID-19.
Aside from PGH, the priority hospitals for vaccination are the Lung Center of the Philippines, Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium (Tala Hospital), PNP General Hospital, Pasig City General Hospital, and the V. Luna Medical Center.
Only 180 of the 1,165 surveyed at the Tala Hospital expressed interest in the Sinovac vaccine. The hospital chief said a contingency plan is in place to avoid wastage. 
The Department of Health has assured health workers that the vaccine is “safe” and “beneficial” for them as it can reduce morbidity and mortality linked to COVID-19. 
Citing data from the Sinovac’s dossier, an epidemiologist also said the Chinese vaccine showed 100% efficacy against severe COVID-19. 
The government aims to secure 148 million doses to vaccinate 70 million Filipinos this year. 
Only the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have been approved for emergency use by the FDA.
The Philippines has recorded 576,352 infections with 534,271 recoveries and 12,318 deaths as of Sunday afternoon. — KBK/RSJ, GMA News

UNICEF, the world's single largest vaccine buyer, is part of the World Health Organization-backed COVAX program to supply COVID-19 shots to emerging economies.
""We have been asking the world for more funding... for UNICEF and our distribution to countries we still need about $1 billion,"" UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore said at Dubai's World Government Summit, held virtually this year.
That funding could be used strengthen health systems in poorer nations and support the distribution of vaccines there, she said.
The COVAX initiative aims to deliver at least 2 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses this year, including 1.3 billion doses to lower income countries.

Dr. Rontgene Solante noted that the Sinovac shot yielded 50.4% efficacy among health workers attending to COVID-19 patients in Brazil, where cases are higher.
“If you are here in the Philippines, in which the attack rate is not as high as that during the trial conducted in Brazil, then it might have a better efficacy here in the Philippines,” he said at a briefing.
Solante also said that immunogenicity, a foreign substance’s ability to provoke an immune response, increased slightly when the interval between the first and second dose was lengthened from 14 days to four weeks.
“So I am banking on that, with this vaccine, since this will be rolled out in the Philippines, we may have a better protection compared to doon sa nakikita natin sa Brazilian study,” he said.

“Gusto po talaga niya Sinopharm,” Roque said during the Palace briefing.
“Eh kaso nga, wala pa pong EUA, kaya ayaw noong mga doktor, mga eksperto,” he added.
EUA is emergency use authorization issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which is needed for a vaccine to be legally administered in the country.

“Wala pa pong application sa 'min,” Domingo said during the Laging Handa briefing. 
“Hindi po namin hinaharang [ang application ng Sinopharm for EUA],” he added.
The FDA however approved the compassionate use of the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for the benefit of Presidential Security Group (PSG) members, the Palace said last week.

PSG commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III confirmed the President’s statement, even saying that they inoculated themselves with the unregistered Sinopharm vaccine.
Roque, however, did not categorically deny Tulfo’s claim that the President had talked to a Sinopharm representative identified as John Boja because the Chief Executive wants to secure their vaccine.
“I am not belying Mon Tulfo. That is his article (The Manila Times column),” Roque said.

Blood taken from people who had been given the vaccine neutralized an engineered version of the virus that contained the same mutations carried on the spike portion of the highly contagious P.1 variant first identified in Brazil, the study conducted by scientists from the companies and the University of Texas Medical Branch found.
The scientists said the neutralizing ability was roughly equivalent the vaccine's effect on a previous less contagious version of the virus from last year.
The spike, used by the virus to enter human cells, is the primary target of many COVID-19 vaccines.
In previously published studies, Pfizer had found that its vaccine neutralized other more contagious variants first identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa, although the South African variant may reduce protective antibodies elicited by the vaccine.

ANGELICA GARCIA,2021-03-01 17:32:00,"One million doses of Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine are expected to arrive in the Philippines in March.
Sinovac Biotech general manager Helen Yang said Monday they are still discussing the shipment with the Philippine government.
“We are discussing with the Philippine government to arrange another one million doses in March. We’re working on that,” Yang said in an interview on ANC.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government will buy a million doses of the Sinovac vaccine worth P700 million within the month.
“Kaya po tayo, mayroon tayong procurement this coming March, mayroon po tayong one million from Sinovac,” Galvez explained during the briefing held on the first day of the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program.

On Sunday, China’s donation of 600,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses from Sinovac arrived at the Villamor Airbase on a Chinese Y-20 Transporter aircraft.
The first batch of vaccines will be rolled out to several hospitals in the National Capital Region, marking a turning point in the country’s battle against COVID-19.
Earlier in the day, University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi became the Philippines' first official recipient of a CoronaVac against COVID-19.
Several government officials, including vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., Food and Drug Administration director general Eric Domingo, and testing czar Secretary Vince Dizon also received the Sinovac shot.
Meanwhile, Yang recommended that the second dose of the Sinovac shot should be taken after 14 to 28 days.
“Some countries do it 28 days but if under emergency, they can also follow 14 days apart,” she said.
“For this, I would recommend to follow the (Food and Drug Administration) recommendation,” she added.
Further, she said in most cases, the side effect is muscle pain.
So far, only the vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac have been approved for emergency use by the FDA.

Voting 225-0-6, lawmakers approved House Bill 8648 or the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021, which also aims to expedite the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines without having to go through the long process of public bidding.
Under the measure is the creation of a COVID-19 National Vaccine Indemnity Fund, which will be used to compensate any individual inoculated through COVID-19 vaccination program, in case of death, permanent disability, or hospitalization confinement.
""The amount of P500 million is hereby authorized to augment the funds of PhilHealth for this purpose which shall be sourced from the contingent fund as provided under Republic Act 11518 or the General Appropriations Act of 2021,"" the bill stated.
""The claim for indemnification for serious adverse event directly arising from the administration of COVID-19 vaccine must be filed within five years from the day of inoculation,"" it said.

The bill said the Inter-Agency Task Force should establish a special task group, composed of medical and vaccine experts, that will be directed to monitor if there will be negative effects of the vaccine.
The bill further states that provinces, cities and municipalities may procure or accept donations only in cooperation with the Department of Health and National Task Force through a multiparty agreement, which shall include the DOH and the relevant supplier or donor of COVID-19 vaccine.
""These LGUs shall procure no more than 50% of their target population for vaccination. Provided, further, that the 50% cap may be adjusted by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases when there is sufficient supply of vaccines as determined by DOH and NTF,"" the bill said.
It also said the provision on advance payment shall apply to procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services.
The measure added that LGUs may directly accept donation of vaccines as long as they have been procured through a multiparty agreement.
There will be a Vaccine Passport Program in the proposed measure, which will be the record of the vaccinations received by a certain individual.
This passport is intended to be digital and will note basic information of the person being vaccinated, the manufacturer of the vaccine, and the date of vaccination, among others.
The proposed measure will also exempt the procurement, deployment and administration of COVID-9 vaccines from import duties, taxes and other fees.

The same condition was reported in Dr. Gregory Michael who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Michael later died from a brain hemorrhage.
Legaspi was said to have woken up with bruises on her limbs and blisters inside her mouth three days after taking the first dose.
The cases have been forwarded to the manufacturers and are currently being investigated, but so far regulators such as the United States Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that rates did not appear higher than usual in the US population.

""We are collecting relevant information to share with the F.D.A. However, at this time, we have not been able to establish a causal association with our vaccine,"" Pfizer was quoted as saying in the article.
Meanwhile, Moderna was likewise quoted as saying that it ""continuously monitors the safety of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine using all sources of data,"" but questions on the platelet disorder were not addressed.
In the same article, the New York Times said Legaspi's daughter -- who requested that her name not be used -- still firmly believed in the need for vaccines moving forward.

Researchers tracked vaccine responses in 11 survivors of mild COVID-19 and 33 never-infected individuals.
In everyone, the vaccines induced the immune system to produce antibodies along with so-called B cells that remember the virus and remain ready to produce new antibodies to fight it, although the magnitude of the B cell response was lower in older people.
Those not previously infected ""benefited from both doses,"" with additional antibody and memory B cell increases after the second shot, researchers reported on Saturday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.
COVID-19 survivors, however, had significant responses to the first dose with no increase in antibodies or memory B cells after the second dose.

Survivors' levels of memory B cells before vaccination correlated strongly with their antibody levels post vaccination, ""indicating that these B cells were the likely source"" of survivors' boosted antibody levels after just a single shot, said coauthor John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania.
This suggests memory B cells will play important roles if antibody levels fall over time, he added. Because memory B cells can be the source of new antibodies with some degree of ""adaptability,"" they might play a role in immunity to variant viruses, he speculated. -- Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.9941999912261963,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['new', 'datum', 'provide', 'clue', 'survivor', 'need', 'dose', 'dose', 'moderna', 'inc', 'vaccine', 'researcher', 'track', 'response', 'survivor', 'mild', 'never', 'infect', 'individual', 'vaccine', 'induce', 'immune_system', 'produce', 'antibody', 'call', 'cell', 'remember', 'virus', 'remain', 'ready', 'produce', 'new', 'antibody', 'fight', 'magnitude', 'cell', 'response', 'lower', 'old', 'people', 'previously', 'infect', 'benefit', 'dose', 'additional', 'antibody', 'memory', 'cell', 'increase', 'second', 'shot', 'researcher', 'report', 'saturday', 'ahead', 'peer_review', 'survivor', 'however', 'significant', 'response', 'first', 'dose', 'increase', 'antibody', 'memory', 'cell', 'second', 'dose', 'story', 'response', 'weak', 'elderly', 'merck', 'drug', 'show', 'promise', 'reduce', 'virus', 'level', 'greece', 'mourn', 'young', 'victim', 'day', 'baby', 'year', 'say', 'early', 'alarm', 'fall', 'deaf', 'ear', 'survivor', 'level', 'memory', 'cell', 'vaccination', 'correlate', 'strongly', 'post', 'vaccination', 'indicate', 'cell', 'likely', 'source', 'survivor', 'boost', 'antibody_level', 'single', 'shot', 'say', 'coauthor', 'wherry', 'university', 'pennsylvania', 'suggest', 'memory', 'cell', 'play', 'important', 'role', 'antibody_level', 'fall', 'time', 'add', 'memory', 'cell', 'source', 'new', 'antibody', 'degree', 'adaptability', 'play', 'role', 'immunity', 'variant', 'virus', 'speculate', 'reuters']",0.959,0.088,0.688,0.224,0.43306277056277065,Positive

The statement was issued after the World Health Organization (WHO) approved two versions of the AstraZeneca/Oxford COVID-19 for emergency use and are available for global distribution.
COVAX also said that in order for the doses to be delivered via the first allocation round, the following critical pieces must be in places:
All facility participants must have given national regulatory authorization for the vaccines in question, a process which can be expedited by issuing special authorizations for use based on granting of WHO Emergency Use Listing.
All facility participants must have signed indemnity agreements with the manufacturers in question in order to receive doses through COVAX.
Advance Market Commitment-eligible economies must have submitted National Deployment and Vaccination Plans through the COVID-19 Partners Platform, that have then been reviewed and validated by COVAX.
COVAX said the bulk of the first round of deliveries can be expected in March.

But for those who have already fulfilled the said criteria, the shipment of may be done by late February.
“As participants fulfil the criteria and finalize readiness preparations, COVAX will issue purchase orders to the manufacturer and ship and deliver doses via an iterative process. This means deliveries for this first round of allocation will take place on a rolling basis and in tranches,” it said.
“Due the high number of doses available as well as the high number of countries getting ready for delivery in Q1 2021, the capacity of supplier and freight forwarders will be under considerable pressure. Shipment timelines will be impacted by logistical preparedness and delivery lead times, which may vary depending on the location of the receiving participant,” it added.
The WHO earlier said the Philippines’ indemnity plan is now in the hands of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Pfizer.
The COVAX Facility is expected to send more than 100,000 doses of Pfizer BioNTech vaccines to the country once the firm signs off on the Philippines indemnification measures.
The country's lack of an indemnification law—a measure ensuring compensation for individuals who develop serious side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine—has delayed the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Philippines.
At a Senate panel hearing last week, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have been delivered to the country as early as February 12 if the Philippines had its own indemnification law.
The country is expected to receive at least 5.6 million doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines within the first quarter of 2021. -- Ma.

Senator Sonny Angara, Finance committee chair, sponsored Tuesday the proposed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act and sought its swift approval.
He said the bill seeks to authorize the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.
It also allows local government units to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through multiparty agreements.
The LGUs will be allowed to make advance payments but they can only purchase vaccines and supplies for up to 50% of their target population. The 50% cap may be adjusted by the IATF depending on the supply.

Angara said, as proposed by Minority Leader Franklin Drilon, LGUs must give due priority to frontline healthworkers, senior citizens, and indigent persons. They will also be required to exercise transparency and report any supply or purchase agreement they will enter.
He added, as recommended by Senator Joel Villanueva, the bill states the LGUs have to submit a masterlist of the names and profiles of their constituents who are eligible to receive vaccines.
“While there is roughly P82.5 billion that has been appropriated in 2021 for our national immunization program against COVID-19, we are adding more to this fund by allowing LGUs to use whatever resources they have to purchase vaccines and related supplies,” the senator said.
“By allowing LGUs to take an active part in the procurement of vaccines, we also increase the volumes that we are purchasing, which in turn would allow the national government, particularly the office of our vaccine czar Sec. Charlie Galvez, to negotiate for more affordable prices,” he added.
Under the bill, private entities, in cooperation with the DOH and NTF, will also be allowed to purchase vaccines for their own use through a multiparty agreement.
The bill also states that purchases of COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies for their storage, transport, and distribution will be exempted from customs duties, value-added tax (VAT), excise tax, donor’s tax, and other fees and charges.
“This is to complement the exemptions provided in the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act or CREATE which is awaiting the signature of the President,” said Angara.
The Finance committee chair said the measure also seeks to establish a COVID-19 National Indemnity Fund, as proposed by the Department of Finance, which shall only be used to compensate any inoculated person who will experience severe adverse effect or worse death.
“This fund will be worth P500 million. And as suggested by Minority Floor Leader Drilon, it will be sourced from the Contingent Fund and shall be administered by PhilHealth,” he said.
The bill also contains provision for the creation of Vaccine Passport Program. Vaccination passports will be issued by the Department of Health to individuals who have been inoculated and will contain basic information about the person, as well as the brand of vaccine used and the date of inoculation.
Angara said since the passports are intended to be digital, the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) will be mandated to develop the needed digital systems and applications. But because of the digital divide in the country, the passports will also be available as printed documents.
“These passports will serve as documentary proof that a person has completed a full round of COVID-19 vaccinations, which could then allow them to go abroad to wherever they are permitted, engage in non-essential domestic travel, to grant them quick passage through local checkpoints, and even access to business establishments,” the senator said.
He said a special task group composed of medical and vaccine experts will be established to conduct post-vaccination monitoring of patients.
“This is to ensure a quick response in case there are any who might experience serious adverse side effects after being vaccinated,” he said.
The bill also authorizes the Health Technology Assessment Council or HTAC to make recommendations to the DOH and PhilHealth about COVID-19 vaccines based on preliminary Phase III clinical trials, but only when the relevant vaccine manufacturer has been issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
“The development of COVID-19 vaccines in such a short amount of time is in itself a huge scientific achievement. But that alone will not end this pandemic.  That alone will not bring things back to normal,” said Angara.
“To achieve that, we will need nothing less than the whole nation acting together. All sectors of society, all levels of government, all our policies, all our regulations, all our systems need to be aligned and properly synced. Every part will need to act harmoniously.  In the end, we won’t just be injecting vaccines. We’ll be injecting hope—which is perhaps the single-most important ingredient to our recovery as a nation,” he added.—AOL, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.9296000003814697,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['set', 'discuss', 'plenary', 'bill', 'seek', 'expedite', 'purchase', 'administration', 'vaccine', 'establish', 'finance', 'committee', 'chair', 'sponsor', 'tuesday', 'propose', 'act', 'seek', 'swift', 'approval', 'say', 'bill', 'seek', 'authorize', 'department', 'health', 'doh', 'force', 'ntf', 'undertake', 'vaccine', 'ancillary_supplie', 'service', 'storage', 'transport', 'distribution', 'also', 'allow', 'local', 'government', 'unit', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'ancillary_supplie', 'service', 'cooperation', 'doh', 'ntf', 'multiparty', 'agreement', 'lgus', 'allow', 'make', 'advance_payment', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'supply', 'target', 'population', 'cap', 'adjust', 'iatf', 'depend', 'supply', 'story', 'philhealth', 'discuss', 'compensation', 'recipient', 'suffer', 'serious_side', 'effect', 'gierran', 'robredo', 'dismiss', 'marcos', 'poll', 'protest', 'truth', 'prevail', 'petitioner', 'ask', 'anew', 'stop', 'implementation', 'anti', 'terror', 'law', 'angara', 'say', 'proposed', 'minority', 'leader', 'franklin', 'lgus', 'give', 'due', 'priority', 'frontline', 'healthworker', 'indigent', 'person', 'also', 'require', 'exercise', 'transparency', 'report', 'supply', 'purchase', 'agreement', 'enter', 'add', 'recommend', 'senator', 'villanueva', 'bill', 'state', 'lgus', 'submit', 'masterlist', 'name', 'profile', 'constituent', 'eligible', 'receive', 'vaccine', 'roughly', 'appropriate', 'national', 'immunization', 'program', 'add', 'fund', 'allow', 'lgus', 'use', 'resource', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'relate', 'supply', 'senator', 'say', 'allow', 'lgus', 'take', 'active', 'part', 'procurement', 'vaccine', 'also', 'increase', 'volume', 'purchase', 'turn', 'allow', 'national', 'government', 'particularly', 'office', 'czar', 'sec', 'charlie', 'galvez', 'negotiate', 'affordable', 'price', 'add', 'bill', 'private_entitie', 'cooperation', 'doh', 'ntf', 'also', 'allow', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'use', 'multiparty', 'agreement', 'bill', 'also', 'state', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'necessary', 'supply', 'storage', 'transport', 'distribution', 'exempt', 'custom', 'duty', 'value', 'add', 'tax', 'vat', 'excise', 'tax', 'donor', 'tax', 'fee', 'charge', 'complement', 'exemption', 'provide', 'corporate', 'recovery', 'tax', 'incentive', 'enterprise', 'act', 'create', 'await', 'signature', 'president', 'say', 'finance', 'committee', 'chair', 'say', 'measure', 'also', 'seek', 'establish', 'national', 'proposed', 'department', 'finance', 'use', 'compensate', 'inoculate', 'person', 'experience', 'severe', 'adverse', 'effect', 'bad', 'death', 'fund', 'worth', 'suggest', 'minority', 'floor', 'leader', 'drilon', 'source', 'administer', 'philhealth', 'say', 'bill', 'also', 'contain', 'provision', 'creation', 'passport', 'program', 'vaccination', 'passport', 'issue', 'department', 'health', 'individual', 'inoculate', 'contain', 'basic', 'information', 'person', 'well', 'brand', 'use', 'date', 'inoculation', 'angara', 'say', 'passport', 'intend', 'digital', 'department', 'information', 'communication', 'technology', 'dict', 'mandate', 'develop', 'need', 'digital', 'system', 'application', 'digital', 'divide', 'country', 'passport', 'also', 'available', 'print', 'document', 'passport', 'serve', 'documentary', 'proof', 'person', 'complete', 'full', 'round', 'vaccination', 'allow', 'go', 'abroad', 'wherever', 'permit', 'engage', 'non', 'essential', 'domestic', 'travel', 'grant', 'quick', 'passage', 'local', 'checkpoint', 'even', 'access', 'business', 'establishment', 'senator', 'say', 'say', 'special', 'task', 'group', 'compose', 'medical', 'expert', 'establish', 'conduct', 'post', 'vaccination', 'monitoring', 'patient', 'ensure', 'quick', 'response', 'case', 'experience', 'side_effect', 'vaccinate', 'say', 'bill', 'also', 'authorize', 'health', 'council', 'htac', 'make', 'recommendation', 'doh', 'philhealth', 'vaccine', 'base', 'preliminary', 'phase', 'relevant', 'manufacturer', 'issue', 'food', 'fda', 'development', 'vaccine', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'huge', 'scientific', 'achievement', 'alone', 'end', 'pandemic', 'alone', 'bring', 'thing', 'back', 'normal', 'say', 'angara', 'achieve', 'need', 'less', 'whole', 'nation', 'act', 'together', 'sector', 'society', 'level', 'government', 'policy', 'regulation', 'system', 'need', 'align', 'properly', 'sync', 'part', 'act', 'harmoniously', 'end', 'inject', 'vaccine', 'inject', 'hope', 'perhaps', 'single', 'important', 'ingredient', 'recovery', 'nation', 'add', 'aol']",0.9858,0.062,0.784,0.153,0.36716791979949875,Positive

Expert answers,JOVILAND RITA,2021-02-23 16:37:00,"A health expert on Tuesday addressed several myths and misconceptions, and also provided advice, on COVID-19 vaccinations.
In a forum organized by the Philippine College of Physicians (PCP) and Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Kathryn Uy Roa said that COVID-19 vaccines were not for everyone.
“This is a fact,” Roa added.
However, she emphasized that the only contraindications against the vaccines were allergic reactions to a COVID-19 vaccine and any of its components.
Patients who experienced an immediate allergic reaction, whether mild like rashes or severe like anaphylaxis, to a vaccine's first dose should not receive the second dose.

“Myth No. 2: ‘I have allergies to other vaccines and injectable medications, therefore I cannot get the vaccine.’ So this is false. You need further evaluation by an allergist,” said Roa.
Those who had an immediate allergic reaction to any other vaccine or injected therapy should be evaluated by an allergist to assess possible allergic reactions to some components of COVID-19 vaccines.
For people with allergies to food and medication, Roa said that they can receive COVID-19 vaccines.
“’I have allergies to food and or medication, therefore I cannot get the COVID-19 vaccines.’ So this is false. These are the special groups who can receive the COVID-19 vaccines.”
Roa added that patients suffering from immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases as well as well-controlled asthma may also get a COVID-19 vaccine.
Pregnant
“’I'm pregnant, therefore I cannot get the COVID-19 vaccines.’ This issue needs to be discussed with a doctor. There's very limited data on the effect of vaccines on pregnant women and their babies,” she said.
Roa noted that no safety concerns were flagged in the small group of women included in the vaccine trials as well as in animal studies.
She advised pregnant women to consider the following in deciding whether or not to get vaccinated against COVID-19:
level of COVID-19 community transmission
patient’s personal risk of contracting COVID-19
risk of COVID-19 to the parent and potential risks to the fetus
efficacy of the vaccine
side effects of the vaccines
lack of data about the vaccine during pregnancy.
For lactating mothers, Roa said that there was limited data on the matter but the vaccine without a live virus was unlikely to pose a risk to a breastfeeding child.
The World Health Organization did not recommend discontinuing breastfeeding among mothers who received a vaccine. — DVM, GMA News",GMA News,1.0,0.8781999945640564,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['health', 'expert', 'tuesday', 'address', 'several', 'myth', 'misconception', 'also', 'provide', 'advice', 'vaccination', 'forum', 'organize', 'college', 'physician', 'pcp', 'society', 'microbiology', 'infectious_disease', 'roa', 'say', 'vaccine', 'fact', 'roa', 'add', 'however', 'emphasize', 'vaccine', 'allergic_reaction', 'component', 'patient', 'experience', 'immediate', 'allergic_reaction', 'mild', 'rash', 'severe', 'anaphylaxis', 'vaccine', 'first', 'dose', 'receive', 'second', 'dose', 'story', 'unicef', 'send', 'syrinx', 'maldives', 'ivory', 'coast', 'covax', 'rollout', 'dfa', 'filipino', 'abroad', 'test', 'positive', 'san_juan', 'make', 'downpayment', 'astrazeneca', 'dose', 'myth', 'allergie', 'vaccine', 'injectable', 'medication', 'therefore', 'get', 'false', 'need', 'evaluation', 'allergist', 'say', 'roa', 'immediate', 'allergic_reaction', 'inject', 'therapy', 'evaluate', 'allergist', 'assess', 'possible', 'allergic_reaction', 'component', 'vaccine', 'people', 'allergy', 'food', 'medication', 'roa', 'say', 'receive', 'vaccine', 'allergy', 'food', 'medication', 'therefore', 'get', 'vaccine', 'false', 'special', 'group', 'receive', 'vaccine', 'roa', 'add', 'patient', 'suffer', 'autoimmune', 'disease', 'well', 'well', 'control', 'asthma', 'also', 'get', 'pregnant', 'm', 'pregnant', 'therefore', 'get', 'vaccine', 'issue', 'need', 'discuss', 'doctor', 's', 'limited', 'datum', 'effect', 'vaccine', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'baby', 'say', 'roa', 'note', 'safety', 'concern', 'flag', 'small', 'group', 'woman', 'include', 'trial', 'animal', 'study', 'advise', 'pregnant', 'woman', 'consider', 'follow', 'decide', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'level', 'community', 'transmission', 'patient', 'personal', 'risk', 'contracting', 'risk', 'parent', 'fetus', 'efficacy', 'side_effect', 'vaccine', 'lack', 'datum', 'pregnancy', 'lactate', 'mother', 'roa', 'say', 'limited', 'datum', 'matter', 'live', 'virus', 'unlikely', 'pose', 'risk', 'breastfeed', 'child', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'recommend', 'discontinue', 'breastfeed', 'mother', 'receive', 'dvm']",-0.5106,0.098,0.824,0.078,0.4282068808384598,Negative

Zubiri congratulated his colleagues, particularly Senator Sonny Angara, over the approval of Senate Bill 2057, which the Senate consecutively approved on second and third reading earlier in the day.
Sponsored by Angara on the Senate floor, the measure seeks to expedite the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines and establish a vaccine indemnity fund.
""I'd like to congratulate all our colleagues because we are probably the first country in the world to legislate vaccine procurement and implementation without a single vaccine yet,"" Zubiri said.

Under the measure, the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) are authorized to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.
It also allows local government units to procure COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through multiparty agreements.
Moreover, a COVID-19 National Indemnity Fund, to be administered by PhilHealth, will also be established under the measure to compensate any inoculated person who will experience permanent disability, hospital confinement, or death.
A P500 million will be authorized to augment the funds of PhilHealth for this purpose, to be sourced from the contingent fund under the 2021 General Appropriations Act.
Zubiri said that with the passage of the measure, the job of procuring the COVID-19 vaccines is now in the hands of the executive branch.
""We are not remiss in our job as legislators. Ginawa na natin ang lahat. Ang bola ay nasa korte na ng ehekutibo,"" he said.
""So we hope now there will be no hindrance to the coming of the vaccines and the implementation of the rollout,"" he added.
The House of Representatives also approved its version of the measure on second reading on Monday.
Zubiri is expecting that the House will adopt the Senate version of the measure so there will no longer be a bicameral conference committee meeting to reconcile the two bills. -NB, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.9958000183105469,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['majority', 'leader', 'welcome', 'passage', 'propose', 'law', 'vaccination', 'procurement', 'administration', 'say', 'jest', 'probably', 'first', 'country', 'approve', 'measure', 'single', 'zubiri', 'congratulate', 'colleague', 'particularly', 'angara', 'approval', 'senate', 'bill', 'consecutively', 'approve', 'second', 'third', 'reading', 'early', 'day', 'sponsor', 'angara', 'senate', 'floor', 'measure', 'seek', 'expedite', 'procurement', 'administration', 'vaccine', 'establish', 'd', 'congratulate', 'colleague', 'probably', 'first', 'country', 'world', 'legislate', 'procurement', 'implementation', 'single', 'yet', 'zubiri', 'say', 'magaling', 'talaga', 'ang', 'legislative', 'sector', 'country', 'add', 'draw', 'laughter', 'senator', 'story', 'okay', 'hasten', 'procurement', 'defense', 'dept', 'get', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'china', 'health', 'worker', 'still', 'get', 'sinovac', 'choose', 'say', 'chief', 'measure', 'department', 'health', 'doh', 'force', 'ntf', 'authorize', 'undertake', 'vaccine', 'ancillary_supplie', 'service', 'storage', 'transport', 'distribution', 'also', 'allow', 'local', 'government', 'unit', 'procure', 'vaccine', 'ancillary_supplie', 'service', 'cooperation', 'doh', 'ntf', 'multiparty', 'agreement', 'moreover', 'national', 'administer', 'philhealth', 'also', 'establish', 'measure', 'compensate', 'inoculate', 'person', 'experience', 'permanent', 'disability', 'hospital', 'confinement', 'death', 'authorize', 'augment', 'fund', 'philhealth', 'purpose', 'source', 'general', 'appropriation', 'act', 'zubiri', 'say', 'passage', 'measure', 'job', 'procure', 'vaccine', 'hand', 'executive', 'branch', 'remiss', 'job', 'legislator', 'ginawa', 'na', 'ang', 'lahat', 'ang', 'bola', 'nasa', 'korte', 'na', 'ng', 'ehekutibo', 'say', 'hope', 'hindrance', 'come', 'vaccine', 'implementation', 'rollout', 'add', 'house', 'representative', 'also', 'approve', 'version', 'measure', 'second', 'reading', 'zubiri', 'expect', 'house', 'adopt', 'version', 'measure', 'long', 'bicameral', 'conference', 'committee', 'meeting', 'reconcile', 'bill', 'nb']",0.9708,0.031,0.82,0.15,0.28775510204081634,Positive

Senator Bong Go, Duterte's former special assistant, earlier said Duterte believed that MGCQ was not in the best interest of the country.
""No vaccine rollout, no MGCQ muna -PRRD,"" Go said in a message to reporters.
Go said the President also told Education Secretary Leonor Briones that he is not ready to allow the resumption of face to face classes.
Duterte was quoted as saying that he cannot, in his conscience, ""allow these things to happen.""
The President also expressed confidence that the Filipino people and the economic managers will understand the situation, Go said.
The National Economic Development Authority has proposed placing the entire Philippines under the MGCQ starting March 1 supposedly to balance the country's response to stop the spread of COVID-19 and the need of Filipinos to start earning and spending.
However, Dr. Guido David of the OCTA Research Team said the government could be taking a costly risk if the entire Philippines would be  placed under MGCQ.
Navotas Mayor Toby Tiangco earlier said that majority of the mayors in Metro Manila are in favor of putting the region under MGCQ next month.

No date has been set for the vaccination although the President is part of the priority population because he is a senior citizen, his spokesperson Harry Roque told a news conference.
“He only has to announce when it will be done and that’s of course in recognition of the fact na nag-aantay ng senyales ang taumbayan kung talaga sila’y magpapabakuna o hindi,” Roque said.
“Ninanais po ng Presidente na lahat ng Pilipino ay magkaroon ng kumpyansa na magpabukana dahil ang bakuna po ang solusyon dito sa pandemiya ng COVID-19.”
Roque said last month that Duterte wanted to be vaccinated in private.

Weeks later, Duterte’s close confidante, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, issued a statement that the 75-year-old President is now willing to take the vaccine publicly as long as there is clearance from his doctors.
US President Joe Biden, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are among the world leaders whose vaccinations were made in public.
The Philippines aims to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos this year with the rollout expected to begin this month. Frontline health workers will be the first to receive the vaccines, according to the government.
A Pulse Asia survey in January said a near majority of Filipino adults are ""not inclined"" to get the COVID-19 vaccine, with safety concerns being the top reason.
While 95% of Filipinos said they are aware vaccines are being developed, 47% said they would not get vaccinated. Only 32% expressed willingness and the remaining 21% said they were ambivalent, according to Pulse Asia.
Eighty-four percent of those who said they would not get vaccinated cited safety concerns as the reason for their unwillingness.  —KBK, GMA News",GMA News,1.0,0.9947999715805054,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['duterte', 'decide', 'vaccinate', 'public', 'encourage', 'filipino', 'take', 'say', 'monday', 'date', 'set', 'vaccination', 'president', 'part', 'priority', 'population', 'senior_citizen', 'roque', 'tell', 'conference', 'announce', 'do', 'course', 'recognition', 'fact', 'nag', 'aantay', 'ng', 'ang', 'taumbayan', 'kung', 'talaga', 'sila', 'magpapabakuna', 'hindi', 'roque', 'say', 'ninanais', 'ng', 'pilipino', 'ng', 'kumpyansa', 'magpabukana', 'bakuna', 'po', 'ang', 'solusyon', 'dito', 'ng', 'roque', 'say', 'last', 'month', 'duterte', 'want', 'vaccinate', 'private', 'story', 'go', 'ask', 'duterte', 'certify', 'proposed', 'indemnification_fund', 'law', 'urgent', 'house', 'panel', 'ok', 'tax', 'exemption', 'vaccine', 'purchase', 'lgus', 'target', 'recipient', 'city', 'register', 'vaccination', 'far', 'week', 'later', 'close', 'confidante', 'issue', 'statement', 'year', 'old', 'president', 'willing', 'take', 'publicly', 'long', 'clearance', 'doctor', 'president', 'indonesian', 'president', 'prime', 'minister', 'world', 'leader', 'vaccination', 'make', 'public', 'aim', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'year', 'rollout', 'expect', 'begin', 'month', 'frontline', 'health', 'worker', 'first', 'receive', 'vaccine', 'accord', 'government', 'survey', 'january', 'say', 'majority', 'filipino', 'adult', 'incline', 'get', 'safety', 'concern', 'top', 'reason', 'filipino', 'say', 'aware', 'vaccine', 'develop', 'say', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'expressed_willingness', 'remain', 'say', 'ambivalent', 'accord', 'percent', 'say', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'cite', 'safety', 'concern', 'reason', 'unwillingness', 'kbk']",0.8126,0.036,0.861,0.103,0.34345238095238095,Positive

According to Lei Alviz's exclusive report on ""24 Oras"", the COVAX Facility is expected to send more than 100,000 doses of Pfizer BioNTech vaccines to the country once the firm signs off on the Philippines indemnification measures.
""We believe that that was the last standing requirement and it should now be reviewed by Pfizer and COVAX and we are hoping for a positive feedback from them,"" WHO country representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said.
There is still no definite date as regards when the initial 117,000 doses will arrive in the country.

The WHO official said the Philippines had requested 900,000 doses of Pfizer's vaccine and low dead space syringes.
Low dead space syringes ensure less wastage per vial. It can make five-dose vials yield one more or six doses.
No law, no delivery
The country's lack of an indemnification law—a measure ensuring compensation for individuals who develop serious side effects after getting a COVID-19 vaccine—has delayed the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine doses to the Philippines.
At a Senate panel hearing last week, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine could have been delivered to the country as early as February 12 if the Philippines had its own indemnification law.
The Philippines is expected to receive at least 5.6 million doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines within the first quarter of 2021, with the initial batch of 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines arriving this month.
Galvez has been calling on Congress to pass an indemnification law, which he said is required by COVAX, the globally-pooled vaccine procurement and distribution effort co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
Indemnification deal
With the law still being crafted in Congress, the Philippine government proposed an  agreement with Pfizer-BioNTech that would ensure compensation for Filipinos who will experience serious side effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
“As reported by Sec. Galvez, our vaccine czar, the indemnification agreement with Pfizer is being reviewed by our team and should be finalized in a few days,” National Task Force Against COVID-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon said in a message to reporters.
“This will allow us to complete the documents needed for the delivery of the 117,000 Pfizer doses from the COVAX facility,” he added.
Bills have been filed in Congress for the creation of an indemnity mechanism but presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said President Rodrigo Duterte would not immediately certify them as urgent.
No certification as urgent
He said that certifying proposed measures as urgent did not guarantee quick passage into law by Congress.
“Ang mas importante ay ang mensahe ng Presidente sa Kongreso na ito po ay urgent at priority ng administration dahil kung wala ito ay baka maantala ang pagdating ng bakuna galing sa Covax facility,” Roque said on Friday.
“Bagamat I was assured na hindi kinakailangan ipasa ‘yung batas, kinakailangan lang na simulan lang ang proseso para mapadala na ‘yung bakuna ng COVAX facility,” he added. -NB, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.8004000186920166,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['indemnity', 'plan', 'hand', 'manufacturer', 'pfizer', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'say', 'accord', 'exclusive', 'report', 'oras', 'covax_facility', 'expect', 'send', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'country', 'firm', 'sign', 'indemnification', 'measure', 'believe', 'last', 'standing', 'requirement', 'review', 'pfizer', 'covax', 'hope', 'positive', 'feedback', 'country', 'representative', 'abeyasinghe', 'say', 'still', 'definite', 'date', 'regard', 'initial', 'dose', 'arrive', 'country', 'hopefully', 'later', 'week', 'late', 'next', 'week', 'give', 'timeline', 'depend', 'manufacturer', 'abeyasinghe', 'say', 'story', 'uk', 'look', 'path', 'lockdown', 'vaccinate', 'oppose', 'risky', 'reopen', 'cinema', 'lgu', 'offer', 'free', 'swab', 'test', 'cinema', 'worker', 'official', 'say', 'request', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'low', 'dead', 'space', 'syrinx', 'low', 'dead', 'space', 'syrinx', 'ensure', 'less', 'wastage', 'vial', 'make', 'dose', 'vial', 'yield', 'dose', 'law', 'delivery', 'countrys', 'lack', 'measure', 'ensure', 'compensation', 'individual', 'develop', 'serious_side', 'effect', 'get', 'delay', 'delivery', 'pfizer', 'dose', 'panel', 'hear', 'czar', 'say', 'pfizer', 'deliver', 'country', 'early', 'february', 'expect', 'receive', 'least', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'first', 'quarter', 'initial', 'batch', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'arrive', 'month', 'galvez', 'call', 'congress', 'pass', 'say', 'require', 'covax', 'globally', 'pool', 'procurement', 'distribution', 'effort', 'co', 'lead', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'gavi', 'alliance', 'coalition', 'innovation', 'indemnification', 'deal', 'law', 'still', 'craft', 'congress', 'government', 'propose', 'agreement', 'pfizer_biontech', 'ensure', 'compensation', 'filipino', 'experience', 'effect', 'receive', 'report', 'sec', 'galvez', 'czar', 'indemnification', 'agreement', 'pfizer', 'review', 'team', 'finalize', 'day', 'force', 'deputy', 'dizon', 'say', 'message', 'reporter', 'allow', 'complete', 'document', 'need', 'delivery', 'pfizer', 'dose', 'covax_facility', 'add', 'bill', 'file', 'congress', 'creation', 'indemnity', 'mechanism', 'presidential_spokesman', 'say', 'duterte', 'immediately', 'certify', 'urgent', 'certification', 'urgent', 'say', 'certify', 'propose', 'measure', 'urgent', 'guarantee', 'quick', 'passage', 'law', 'congress', 'ang', 'ng', 'presidente', 'kongreso', 'na', 'ito', 'urgent', 'priority', 'ng', 'administration', 'dahil', 'kung', 'wala', 'baka', 'maantala', 'ang', 'pagdate', 'ng', 'bakuna', 'galing', 'sa', 'covax_facility', 'roque', 'say', 'friday', 'bagamat', 'assure', 'hindi', 'kinakailangan', 'yung', 'lang', 'na', 'simulan', 'lang', 'ang', 'proseso', 'para', 'mapadala', 'yung', 'bakuna', 'ng', 'add', 'nb']",0.9788,0.062,0.772,0.166,0.31791831357048744,Positive

“Reactions to COVID-19 vaccines may happen but majority are local and systemic side effects that will disappear in the first three days,” Dr. Maria Carmen Ang of the PSAAI said.
“Mild reactions can be managed with antihistamines. Anaphylaxis is rare and should be managed with epinephrine,” she added.
The PSAAI added that even those with bronchial asthma, allergic rhinitis and food and insect allergies can still take the vaccine.

Apart from Moderna, the Philippines has reserved 6 million doses of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Johnson and Johnson, but there is no target delivery date yet, Romualdez said.
Janssen is the lone COVID-19 vaccine which is administered with a single dose.
""'Yung Johnson and Johnson, meron tayong naka-reserve na 6 million pero hindi nila masapat kung kailan nila puwedeng ma-deliver 'yan,"" Romualdez said.

In January, the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration approved the COVID-19 vaccine by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE, and that of AstraZeneca for emergency use.
The country started its COVID-19 vaccination program last March 1, with health workers being the first in line to be inoculated.
This came only a day after 600,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Sinovac donated by the Chinese government arrived on February 28.
This was followed by the 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine donated by European nations and Australia under the global initiative COVAX facility which arrived on March 4.
Another batch of 38,400 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines are expected to arrive later in the day.
On Saturday, the Philippines logged 3,439 new COVID-19 cases and 42 new deaths. It was the second time this week that more than 3,000 cases were recorded, indicating an increasing rate of infection in the country.

Galvez made the announcement days after he disclosed that the lack of Vaccine Indemnification Law which would compensate those who will experience adverse effects from getting COVID-19 vaccines have delayed the arrival of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines from COVAX facility—a global effort funding COVID-19 response in aid of countries in need. 
“Ang recommended po ng DOF (Department of Finance) ay P500 million for indemnification,” he said in a press conference during the Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (C.O.D.E.) Team visit in Davao City.
“We have submitted this [indemnification proposal] to COVAX, and we are still awaiting details from the lawyers of Pfizer for additional requirements,” Galvez added.
The vaccine czar said that the indemnification agreement would have to be inked with the COVAX facility and each COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer supplying the COVAX facility, including Pfizer-BioNTech.

According to Sandra Aguinaldo’s report on “24 Oras,” Goffin said the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, which was supposed to arrive last week, has no connection with the EU’s new export control regulation.
“For the Philippines and many other countries, this export license will not apply for the COVAX Initiative which is very relevant to the Philippines because the first Pfizer vaccine will arrive very soon under the COVAX Initiative,” Goffin said.
The Belgian government earlier disclosed a new procedure that pharmaceutical firms will have to take when requesting a license to export COVID-19 vaccines outside of the EU.
According to the Belgian government, securing an export license will enhance transparency in vaccine delivery and will be required until March 31, 2021.

Goffin said the delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines will not be affected by the new regulation as this was from the COVAX Initiative.
The COVAX initiative is a global collaboration of manufacturers and experts that seeks to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
COVAX is co-led by GAVI vaccines alliance, the World Health Organization, and the CEPI Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. It aims to deliver two billion doses of effective, approved COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021.
However, Goffin said COVID-19 vaccines that will be bought from Pfizer outside the COVAX Initiative will undergo the export control regulation.
“It’s the nature of Belgium and the European Union to have as many countries having access to vaccines because this is a worldwide crisis and we have to address it globally. I can assure you that the European Union, Belgium, are really ready to help countries, including the Philippines, to get out of this mess,” he said.
Belgium is the home of the production facilities of some of the world’s most renowned pharmaceutical companies, including those manufacturing COVID-19 vaccines like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson Janssen. — Ma.

According to the Department of Health, the COVAX facility will provide COVID-19 vaccines to 20 percent of the country’s population but only those for 15 percent will be free. Vaccines for the remaining five percent will be paid by the government.
Galvez, however, assured the public that the decrease in the allocation of free vaccines from the COVAX facility would not be a problem, saying the government could still secure additional doses at a reasonable price.
Pruce said the United Kingdom had funded 548 million pounds into the COVAX facility that will help distribute COVID-19 vaccines to developing countries throughout 2021.

According to Lei Alviz’s report on “24 Oras Weekend” on Sunday, the Philippine Food and Drug Administration found that the Sinovac vaccine had an efficacy rate of 65% to 91% for healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old.
However, the FDA did not recommend the Sinovac jab for senior citizens.
“Unfortunately, most of the vaccines that are currently issued an EUA have little data as far as the elderly are concerned, lalo na ‘yong sa young people. So we really have to generate the evidence to be able to show its efficacy in this particular age groups,” Department of Science and Technology–Philippine Council for Health Research Development Executive Director Jaime Montoya said.

In a letter he read during the visit of National Task Force against COVID-19 in the city, Zamora said he is aware that the priority in the vaccination program are healthcare workers and medical frontliners but he believed that being the first to be inoculated will boost his constituents trust and confidence.
“(I) seek your approval...to be the first person to be vaccinated in the City of San Juan. The undersigned is volunteering in order to increase the trust and confidence of our citizens in the vaccination process and to encourage them to have themselves inoculated as well,” he said.
During the presentation, he said, at present, only 19,494 of their residents registered to receive the vaccine.

He said this is still far from their target of 70% or 85, 526 people to achieve herd immunity.
He further said that he personally feels that through volunteering to be the first to be inoculated and showing people that the vaccine is indeed safe and effective “would be a big boost towards this goal.”
“This will convince more people to get vaccinated and therefore increase the number of registrants before the actual rollout,” said Zamora.
Present during the visit were National Action Plan Against COVID -19 deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon, National Economic and Development Authority Acting Secretary Karl Chua, and Metropolitan Manila Develo(pment Authority chairman Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr.

“The COVID-19 vaccination is just an add on factor where to ease restrictions or not at this point in time where the vaccine will come in tranches and will still have to see if the vaccine can block COVID-19 transmission,” Vergeire said during the Laging Handa briefing.
“Also, we can only reach the potential efficacy rate of the vaccines after two doses, so we have to take that into consideration. Ang way pa rin natin [in deciding] at iyong number of cases, health care utilization rate…the vaccination will be an add on factor,” she added.

The rest of the country, on the other hand, are under modified GCQ.

PANTI,2021-01-29 11:27:00,"At least 56 million of COVID-19 vaccine doses made by American pharmaceutical companies are expected to arrive in the Philippines by May, Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez said Friday.
Romualdez said that these COVID-19 vaccine doses will be delivered to the Philippines under the COVAX facility—a global collaboration of manufacturers and experts that seeks to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
“Since May 2020, we have been reaching out to pharmaceutical companies here to secure immediate access to COVID-19 vaccine supply, a pathway to sustainable supply and even co-manufacturing the vaccine with Philippine entities, and I am happy to report that these [initiatives] have been fruitful,” Romualdez said at a virtual forum of the Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines (FOCAP).
“We secured separate deals with Novavax, Moderna, and Johnson and Johnson for 30 million doses, 20 million doses, and six million doses, respectively, and we see initial delivery as early as May,” he added.
Romualdez said that Philippine diplomats in the US are also working on securing a vaccine supply from Pfizer-BioNTech thru COVAX.

It was the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine which secured the first ever emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration after it was found 92% to 95% effective. The second one given an EUA was British firm AstraZeneca after its COVID-19 vaccine was found 70% effective in preventing COVID-19 after the first dose—an efficacy rate that increases after the second dose.
“On Pfizer, we are working on something and this could be done very soon thru COVAX facility,” Romualdez added.
The Philippine government has already inked a 17 million COVID-19 vaccine doses supply deal with AstraZeneca so far, all funded by the private sector for donation to the Philippine government.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said that the government is eyeing to vaccinate 70 million Filipinos against COVID-19 this year in a best case scenario and that the vaccine rollout is expected to start in March.
Galvez also said that the Philippines will be assured of 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from seven companies namely Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac, Astrazeneca, Novovax, Johnson and Johnson, Gamaleya, and Bharat BioTech.—AOL, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.673799991607666,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['least', 'dose', 'make', 'american', 'pharmaceutical_companie', 'expect', 'arrive', 'ambassador', 'united_state', 'romualdez', 'say', 'friday', 'romualdez', 'say', 'dose', 'deliver', 'covax_facility', 'global', 'collaboration', 'manufacturer', 'expert', 'seek', 'accelerate', 'development', 'production', 'equitable_access', 'test', 'treatment', 'vaccine', 'reach', 'pharmaceutical_companie', 'secure', 'immediate', 'access', 'supply', 'pathway', 'sustainable', 'supply', 'even', 'manufacture', 'entity', 'happy', 'report', 'initiative', 'fruitful', 'romualdez', 'say', 'virtual', 'forum', 'foreign', 'correspondent', 'association', 'focap', 'secure', 'separate', 'deal', 'moderna', 'johnson_johnson', 'dose', 'dose', 'dose', 'respectively', 'see', 'initial', 'delivery', 'early', 'add', 'romualdez', 'say', 'diplomat', 'also', 'work', 'secure', 'supply', 'covax', 'story', 'magalong', 'quit', 'contact_trace', 'czar', 'reject', 'nt', 'extend', 'travel_restriction', 'country', 'case', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'variant', 'passi', 'city', 'iloilo', 'place', 'secure', 'first', 'ever', 'food', 'find', 'effective', 'second', 'give', 'british', 'firm', 'astrazeneca', 'find', 'effective', 'prevent', 'first', 'dose', 'increase', 'second', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'work', 'do', 'soon', 'covax_facility', 'romualdez', 'add', 'government', 'already', 'ink', 'dose', 'supply', 'deal', 'astrazeneca', 'far', 'fund', 'private_sector', 'donation', 'government', 'early', 'say', 'government', 'eye', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'year', 'scenario', 'rollout', 'expect', 'start', 'march', 'galvez', 'also', 'say', 'assure', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'company', 'namely', 'sinovac', 'astrazeneca', 'novovax', 'bharat_biotech', 'aol']",0.9712,0.015,0.811,0.174,0.38027009222661395,Positive

German biotech company CureVac, which began late-stage testing of the vaccine in December and expects to announce interim results this quarter, said it aims to produce up to 300 million doses in 2021 and between 600 million and 1 billion doses in 2022.
Bayer, making the first foray into vaccine manufacturing in its 160-year history, expects to produce 160 million doses of the CureVac shot in 2022 at its Wuppertal site in western Germany, head of pharma Stefan Oelrich told a news conference.
Though the volume target was for next year, Bayer hopes to be able to launch production in 2021, Oerlich said.
""For us, the biggest bottleneck in building the production line is to be able to have the production gear installed in time,"" he told Reuters.

The German group had agreed in January to partner Nasdaq-listed CureVac to help to develop its COVID-19 shot, though Oelrich said Bayer is not currently looking at taking a stake in the business backed by investors Dietmar Hopp, the Gates Foundation, GlaxoSmithKline and the German government.
Bayer is the latest big drugmaker to join the push to remedy a shortfall of COVID-19 vaccines after Novartis and Sanofi both said last week that they would help to produce Pfizer's shot.
Separately, CureVac said it had teamed up with contract drugmaker Rentschler to ramp up production.
Manufacturing processes are being tested at Rentschler's site in Laupheim in south-west Germany, which is expected to produce more than 100 million doses a year, the two companies said.
European governments have faced criticism over supply and production bottlenecks as vaccine makers AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna have all announced cuts to deliveries just when they were expected to ramp up production.
Germany is Europe's largest economy, but many Germans have looked on enviously at the faster pace of COVID-19 vaccination programs in Britain, Israel and the United States.
Keen to show it is taking action, the federal government is due to meet regional leaders, vaccine manufacturers and European representatives later on Monday to discuss how to boost output.

Oxford University said the findings of the pre-print paper, which had not been peer-reviewed, supported Britain's decision to extend the interval between initial and booster doses of the shot to 12 weeks.
Britain has decided to give as many people as possible some protection by lengthening the amount of time between initial shots and booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines.
AstraZeneca has welcomed the move, saying flexibility to extend the time between doses is the best strategy for the shot.
The results, gathered from trials in Britain, Brazil and South Africa, indicated some protection was given after one shot and that immune responses were boosted with a longer interval to the second dose among participants aged 18 to 55 years.

Dr. Razel Nikka Hao, Deputy of COVID-19 Surveillance and Quick Action Unit, said that the 116,000 health workers is just an initial list and that registration is still ongoing.
“At this point, we are in the process of master listing for group A1 or all of the workers in frontline health care services. Since January this year, we have reached out  health care facilities and local governments, to determine sino magpi-fit sa mga criteria, sino itong mga eligible...we are getting the numbers which will guide our operational plans,” Hao said during an online briefing.
Under the government’s COVID-19 vaccination program, workers in frontline health services are on top of the priority list. The limited COVID-19 vaccine supply, however, will further  trim this list based on the COVID-19 burden of the area, the local government unit’s capacity to store and distribute vaccines, and the exposure and mortality risk of individuals.
Based on government records, the NCR remains the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country with 4,602 new COVID-19 cases recorded in the last two weeks.

Some common-cold antibodies might help fight COVID-19
Antibodies to the six coronaviruses that cause common colds cannot ""neutralize"" the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but antibodies to two of them might at least help the body fend off severe illness from the new virus, a small preliminary study suggests.
German researchers studied 60 patients with COVID-19, including 25 who were hospitalized but not critically ill, 19 who required intensive care unit admission, and 25 who did not get sick enough to be hospitalized.
The patients who needed intensive care all had significantly lower levels of antibodies to two seasonal coronaviruses, HCoV OC43 and HCoV HKU1, which the authors said are more closely related to the COVID-19 virus compared to the other human coronaviruses.

While the observation does not prove these antibodies are responsible, ""it is remarkable that the effect of HCoV OC43 and HKU1-specific antibody levels reached statistical significance regarding the need for intensive care therapy"" in such a small study, the researchers said in a paper published on Tuesday in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.
""Further studies should validate this finding and explore the potential to identify persons at risk for severe disease course before a SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" they said.
Vaccine side effects may affect mammograms
Routine mammograms should be done either before the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine or four-to-six weeks after the second dose, the Society for Breast Imaging advises.
The vaccines' temporary side effects can include swollen lymph nodes around the armpits, which could be misread as a possible sign of breast cancer if it turns up on a mammogram.
So-called axillary lymphadenopathy is usually seen in only 0.02%-0.04% of screening mammograms, according to the Society's guidelines.
In trials of the Moderna vaccine, the condition developed in 11.6% of participants after the first dose and in 16% after the second dose.
Researchers testing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine did not routinely ask participants about armpit tenderness and lymph node swelling, but some people reported this side effect, which lasted an average of 10 days.
More subtle effects on lymph nodes that are evident only on X-rays are likely to last longer, the Society said, although it is not clear yet what vaccination-related lymph node changes would look like.
""As more information about the incidence and appearance of axillary lymphadenopathy following COVID-19 vaccination becomes available, it may be appropriate to change the duration of follow-up or final assessment recommendations,"" the Society said. -- Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.9965999722480774,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['follow', 'roundup', 'late', 'scientific', 'study', 'effort', 'find', 'treatment', 'vaccine', 'illness', 'cause', 'virus', 'common', 'cold', 'antibody', 'help', 'fight', 'antibody', 'coronaviruse', 'cause', 'common', 'cold', 'neutralize', 'coronavirus', 'cause', 'antibody', 'least', 'help', 'body', 'fend', 'severe', 'illness', 'new', 'virus', 'small', 'preliminary', 'study', 'suggest', 'german', 'researcher', 'study', 'patient', 'include', 'hospitalize', 'critically', 'ill', 'require', 'intensive', 'care', 'unit', 'admission', 'get', 'sick', 'enough', 'hospitalize', 'patient', 'need', 'intensive', 'care', 'significantly', 'low', 'level', 'antibodie', 'seasonal', 'coronaviruse', 'oc', 'hku', 'author', 'say', 'closely', 'relate', 'virus', 'compare', 'human', 'coronaviruse', 'story', 'large', 'real', 'world', 'study', 'confirm', 'pfizer', 'effective', 'moderna', 'develop', 'booster', 'shoot', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'variant', 'increase', 'production', 'target', 'maker', 'want', 'blanket', 'immunity', 'say', 'galvez', 'observation', 'prove', 'antibody', 'responsible', 'remarkable', 'effect', 'oc', 'hku', 'specific', 'antibody_level', 'reach', 'statistical', 'significance', 'regard', 'need', 'intensive', 'care', 'therapy', 'small', 'study', 'researcher', 'say', 'paper', 'publish', 'tuesday', 'international', 'journal', 'study', 'validate', 'finding', 'explore', 'potential', 'identify', 'person', 'risk', 'severe', 'disease', 'course', 'sars_cov', 'infection', 'say', 'side_effect', 'affect', 'mammogram', 'routine', 'mammogram', 'do', 'first', 'dose', 'week', 'second', 'dose', 'society', 'breast', 'imaging', 'advise', 'vaccine', 'temporary', 'side_effect', 'include', 'swollen', 'lymph', 'node', 'armpit', 'misread', 'possible', 'sign', 'breast', 'cancer', 'turn', 'mammogram', 'call', 'axillary', 'lymphadenopathy', 'usually', 'see', 'screening', 'mammogram', 'accord', 'societys', 'guideline', 'trial', 'moderna', 'condition', 'develop', 'participant', 'first', 'dose', 'second', 'dose', 'researcher', 'test', 'pfizer_biontech', 'routinely', 'ask', 'participant', 'armpit', 'tenderness', 'lymph', 'node', 'swell', 'people', 'report', 'side', 'effect', 'last', 'average', 'day', 'subtle', 'effect', 'lymph', 'node', 'evident', 'ray', 'likely', 'last', 'long', 'society', 'say', 'clear', 'vaccination', 'relate', 'lymph', 'node', 'change', 'look', 'information', 'incidence', 'appearance', 'axillary', 'lymphadenopathy', 'follow', 'vaccination', 'becomes_available', 'appropriate', 'change', 'duration', 'follow', 'final', 'assessment', 'recommendation', 'society', 'say', 'reuters']",0.6486,0.113,0.752,0.135,0.47257846320346325,Positive

Dr. Eric Tayag, director IV of the DOH  Knowledge Management and Information Technology Service said based on the latest information they received, people recovering from the disease will have to delay inoculation for at least six months.
“The latest information we have is that those who are recovering from COVID-19 infection, they have to delay receiving the vaccination and there’s information that this should be at least six months,” he said in a webinar.
“While we have this information, such policies will be evaluated and that there will be announcements if those who had COVID-19 can actually receive the vaccine,” Tayag added.
According to the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, individuals who already contracted COVID-19 and have recovered should still be vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine due to the severe health risks associated with the virus and the fact that reinfection is possible.

In a statement on Thursday, the DOF said the inclusion of COVID-19 vaccine imports in the express lane is upon the recommendation of Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko.
The Finance chief also approved the waiving of filing fees for COVID-19 vaccine applications under the “Mabuhay Lane” and the use of the Tax Exemption System (TES) Online Filing Module in processing the vaccine imports “to further support the government's rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program.”
COVID-19 vaccine tax exemption applications in the Mabuhay Lane, which is under the DOF's Revenue Office, will be processed within 24 working hours, the Finance Department said.
These tax exemption policies will be incorporated in the inter-agency guidelines on the implementation of a One-Stop Shop for International Donations and Government Procured COVID-19 Vaccines that is being prepared by the DOF, Department of Health (DOH), Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Bureau of Customs (BOC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it said.

Tionko, who heads the DOF's Revenue Operations Group (ROG), recommended the inclusion in the “Mabuhay Lane” of COVID-19 vaccine imports, “regardless of the applicable legal basis,” to “allow for the expedited processing of the tax and exemption of such applications.”
Under DOF Department Order (DO) No. 54-2000, the Secretary of Finance is authorized to include additional sectors that may avail of the express service under the Mabuhay Lane.
“We add that the Mabuhay Lane currently processes all Relief Consignment under Section 120 in relation to 121 of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA). The Lane is expected to process all COVID-19 vaccines which may qualify as relief consignment,” Tionko said.
Relief Consignment refers to goods donated to national government (NG) agencies and accredited private entities for free distribution to, or for the use of, victims of calamities.
Under Section 121 of the CMTA, relief consignment imported during a state of calamity and intended for the use of calamity victims shall be exempted from the payment of duties and taxes.

PANTI,2021-01-18 14:26:00,"The Philippine government will negotiate for the most ideal prices of safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines, the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday.
The DOH made the assurance in response to Senator Sonny Angara's statement that the market prices of COVID-19 vaccines released by his office were sourced from documents that the DOH submitted to the Senate during the deliberations of the 2021 proposed national budget.
“The DOH clarifies that the said vaccine prices were indicative market prices based on the rates published by different manufacturers generated for the purpose of estimating the proposed budget for the vaccination program. These are not, in any way, the negotiated prices that the government and the manufacturer agreed on,” the DOH said in a statement.
“The DOH urges the public to trust and respect the process that the country, through vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, is undertaking to ensure that Filipinos are afforded the best vaccines at the most ideal prices.”
The DOH issued the statement after vaccine Galvez, Jr. defended the country’s decision to secure 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Sinovac even if its efficacy rates vary from 50% to 91% after human trials in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey.

Sinovac, based on the DOH’s data submission, also costs more (P3,629 for two doses) than Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (P2,379 for two doses), which already secured emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
In a separate statement, Galvez said the vaccine prices that the government is currently negotiating with the vaccine manufacturers are cheaper than the prevailing market price.
“I can assure you that the price of [Sinovac in] Indonesia and the [Sinovac] price of the others (countries which will also be getting Sinovac] will be almost, hindi po nagkakalayo. I can assure you that in our negotiation, the prices relative to our [Southeast Asian] neighbors are fair and considered the best price,” Galvez said.
Pfizer-BioNTech is the only COVID-19 vaccine which has secured EUA from FDA so far. Other pending EUA applications include that of Sinovac, AstraZeneca and Gamaleya.
Galvez earlier said the government will be securing 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from seven vaccine makers, among them Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac, Astrazeneca, Novovax, Johnson and Johnson, Gamaleya and Bharat BioTech.

In a non-commissioned poll conducted from December 9 to 13 last year, the independent team of experts interviewed 600 respondents aged 18 and above regarding their willingness to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
The survey found that only 25% of people in the capital region were willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19, 29% of whom belonged to socioeconomic Class ABC, 24% to Class D, and 27% to Class E.
Meanwhile, the remaining 75% of respondents were either unsure or unwilling to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
Nearly half or 47% of respondents said they were uncertain about getting inoculated against COVID-19, 52% of whom were from Class ABC, 48% from Class D, and 42% from Class E.

Malacañang previously said COVID-19 hotspots Metro Manila, Metro Cebu, and Davao would be prioritized in vaccination efforts due to their high number of infections. 
Out of the 478,861 cases nationwide as of Monday afternoon, more than 211,000 were registered in Metro Manila, according to the Department of Health. 
Vice President Leni Robredo earlier urged a house-to-house education campaign to allay fears about vaccination and warned that the rollout of a vaccine with a low efficacy rate may dampen public confidence in inoculation. 
President Rodrigo Duterte had also said that the government would not shoulder the cost of COVID-19 vaccines for those belonging to Class ABC since they had the capacity “to buy the medicines for themselves.”

Senate Bill 2057 amended House Bill 8648 or the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021, which will allow the speedy procurement of vaccines without having to go through a long process of public bidding.
Under the measure, the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 are authorized to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines as well as the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.
Another key provision in the bill is the indemnity fund, which will be used to compensate individuals inoculated through the COVID-19 vaccination program in case they experience adverse effects.
The P500 million fund will be sourced from the Contingent Fund of the 2021 national budget and will be managed by PhilHealth.
Also, the measure will authorize the use of a vaccine card for those who will be vaccinated.

The MMR II vaccine, manufactured by Merck and licensed in 1979, works by triggering the immune system to produce antibodies.
Researchers reported on Friday in mBio that among 50 COVID-19 patients under the age of 42 who had received the MMR II as children, the higher their titers -- or levels -- of so-called IgG antibodies produced by the vaccine and directed against the mumps virus in particular, the less severe their symptoms.
People with the highest mumps antibody titers had asymptomatic COVID-19. More research is needed to prove the vaccine prevents severe COVID-19.
Still, the new findings ""may explain why children have a much lower COVID-19 case rate than adults, as well as a much lower death rate,"" coauthor Jeffrey Gold, president of World Organization, in Watkinsville, Georgia, said in a statement.

Cigarette smoke increases cell vulnerability to COVID-19
Exposure to cigarette smoke makes airway cells more vulnerable to infection with the new coronavirus, UCLA researchers found.
They obtained airway-lining cells from five individuals without COVID-19 and exposed some of the cells to cigarette smoke in test tubes. Then they exposed all the cells to the coronavirus.
Compared to cells not exposed to the smoke, smoke-exposed cells were two- or even three-times more likely to become infected with the virus, the researchers reported on Tuesday in Cell Stem Cell.
Analysis of individual airway cells showed the cigarette smoke reduced the immune response to the virus. ""If you think of the airways like the high walls that protect a castle, smoking cigarettes is like creating holes in these walls,"" coauthor Brigitte Gomperts told Reuters.
""Smoking reduces the natural defenses and this allows the virus to enter and take over the cells."" -- Reuters",GMA News,2.0,0.9958999752998352,"say, vaccine, health, dose, first, government, trial, country, world, ng","['people', 'immune', 'system', 'respond', 'strongly', 'measle', 'mumps', 'rubella', 'less', 'likely', 'become', 'severely', 'ill', 'infect', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'new', 'datum', 'suggest', 'mmr', 'ii', 'manufacture', 'license', 'work', 'trigger', 'immune_system', 'produce', 'antibody', 'researcher', 'report', 'friday', 'patient', 'age', 'receive', 'mmr', 'ii', 'child', 'high', 'titer', 'level', 'call', 'igg', 'antibody', 'produce', 'direct', 'mumps', 'virus', 'particular', 'less', 'severe', 'symptom', 'people', 'high', 'mumps', 'antibody', 'titer', 'asymptomatic', 'research', 'need', 'prove', 'prevent', 'severe', 'still', 'new', 'finding', 'explain', 'child', 'much', 'low', 'case', 'rate', 'adult', 'well', 'much', 'low', 'death', 'rate', 'coauthor', 'gold', 'president', 'world', 'organization', 'watkinsville', 'georgia', 'say', 'statement', 'story', 'raptor', 'start', 'season', 'tampa', 'spike', 'number', 'dip', 'concern', 'fade', 'stimulus', 'virus', 'fear', 'welcome', 'immunity', 'study', 'give', 'hope', 'vaccine', 'majority', 'child', 'get', 'first', 'vaccination', 'month', 'age', 'second', 'year', 'age', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'increase', 'cell', 'vulnerability', 'exposure', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'make', 'airway', 'cell', 'vulnerable', 'infection', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'ucla', 'researcher', 'find', 'obtain', 'airway', 'lining', 'cell', 'individual', 'expose', 'cell', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'test', 'tube', 'expose', 'cell', 'coronavirus', 'compare', 'cell', 'expose', 'smoke', 'smoke', 'expose', 'cell', 'even', 'time', 'likely', 'become', 'infected', 'virus', 'researcher', 'report', 'tuesday', 'cell', 'stem', 'cell', 'analysis', 'individual', 'airway', 'cell', 'show', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'reduce', 'immune_response', 'virus', 'think', 'airway', 'high', 'wall', 'protect', 'castle', 'smoking', 'cigarette', 'create', 'hole', 'wall', 'coauthor', 'brigitte', 'told_reuter', 'smoking', 'reduce', 'natural', 'defense', 'allow', 'virus', 'enter', 'take', 'cell', 'reuter']",-0.8047,0.149,0.734,0.118,0.47486060606060604,Negative

AstraZeneca-Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine has been found 70% effective against COVID-19 at first half dose, but it increases to 90% after the second full dose is administered a month after the first dose.
Likewise, AstraZeneca’s price range is cheaper at $3 to $4 compared with American firms Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, which also has COVID-19 vaccines that have over 90% effectivity but cost more due to the requirement of an ultra cold storage.
AstraZeneca, however, has admitted that the initial results of its COVID-19 candidate vaccine still needs to be evaluated following concerns raised by experts that it had to reduce its first dose to half since administering two doses in full only resulted in 62% efficacy.
Likewise, AstraZeneca's human trials in the United Kingdom did not include participants aged 56 years old and above, considered a vulnerable sector of the populations alongside health workers.
AstraZeneca is also bidding to conduct clinical trials of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines.
Montoya and Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire, for her part, said it is too early to say if initial concerns on the results of AstraZeneca's clinical trials in the United Kingdom will affect its bid to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines.

for submitting a “business-as-usual” budget, saying 2021 national budget exposes the government's misplaced priorities.
Last month, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said around P73 billion would be needed to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos and achieve herd immunity.
This could be financed through loans and other bilateral agreements with countries that are developing vaccines, according to him. —KBK, GMA News",GMA News,1.0,0.7656000256538391,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['minority', 'leader', 'franklin', 'friday', 'liken', 'government', 'earmark', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'unfunded', 'check', 'po', 'hindi', 'mag', 'bounce', 'drilon', 'say', 'statement', 'reiterate', 'concern', 'lack', 'definite', 'source', 'fund', 'immunize', 'around', 'filipino', 'propose', 'national', 'budget', 'funding', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'fund', 'remain', 'accord', 'unprogrammed', 'fund', 'funding', 'depend', 'approve', 'loan', 'government', 'exceed', 'non', 'tax', 'revenue', 'target', 'unfortunate', 'uncertain', 'time', 'budget', 'create', 'additional', 'uncertainty', 'make', 'filipino', 'wary', 'future', 'drilon', 'say', 'story', 'egypt', 'receive', 'first', 'batch', 'sinopharm', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'consider', 'approval', 'result', 'publish', 'peer', 'review', 'journal', 'angara', 'chair', 'finance', 'panel', 'assure', 'public', 'unprogrammed', 'fund', 'solid', 'assurance', 'angara', 'drilon', 'say', 'still', 'see', 'health', 'system', 'big', 'question', 'mark', 'fluid', 'plan', 'acquisition', 'funding', 'logistical', 'expense', 'go', 'drilon', 'early', 'call', 'duterte', 'administration', 'submit', 'business', 'usual', 'budget', 'say', 'national', 'budget', 'expose', 'government', 'misplace', 'priority', 'last', 'month', 'finance', 'say', 'around', 'need', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'immunity', 'finance', 'loan', 'bilateral_agreement', 'country', 'develop', 'vaccine', 'accord', 'kbk']",-0.34,0.099,0.812,0.09,0.3034722222222223,Negative

According to JP Soriano’s report on “State of the Nation,” the newspaper article said Luz Legaspi “woke up with bruises on her arms and legs, and blisters that bled inside her mouth.”
Experts, however, said it had yet to be proven that it was the vaccine that caused the disorder.
GMA News has reached out to Legaspi for comment.
Moderna has yet to issue a statement regarding the patient. However, it said it “continuously monitors” the safety of its vaccine.

In the trial of nearly 44,000 volunteers, the level of protection against moderate and severe COVID-19 varied from 72% in the United States, to 66% in Latin America and just 57% in South Africa, from where a worrying variant has spread.
A high bar has been set by two authorized vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which were around 95% effective in preventing symptomatic illness in pivotal trials when given in two doses.
Those trials, however, were conducted mainly in the United States and before new variants emerged.
The top US infectious disease specialist Anthony Fauci said the variations in effectiveness around the world underlined the need to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible to prevent new variants from emerging.

""It's really a wake up call for us to be nimble and to be able to adjust as this virus will continue for certain to evolve,"" Fauci said.
J&J's main goal was the prevention of moderate to severe COVID-19, and the vaccine was 85% effective in stopping severe disease and preventing hospitalization across all geographies and against multiple variants 28 days after immunization.
That ""will potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of COVID-19,"" Paul Stoffels, J&J's chief scientific officer, said of the results, which were based on 468 symptomatic cases.
Seeking approval
J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration next week. It has said it plans to deliver 1 billion doses in 2021 and will produce the vaccine in the United States, Europe, South Africa and India.
Public health officials are counting on the J&J vaccine to increase much-needed supply and simplify immunization in the United States, which has a deal to buy 100 million doses of J&J's vaccine and an option for an additional 200 million.
J&J said the vaccine would be ready immediately upon emergency approval, but Stoffels declined to say how many doses.
""Right now, any protection and additional vaccine is great. The key is not only overall efficacy but specifically efficacy against severe disease, hospitalization, and death,"" Walid Gellad, a health policy associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said.
Michael Breen, Director of Infectious Diseases and Ophthalmology at research firm GlobalData said ""Most countries are still desperate to get their hands on doses, regardless of whether or not the vaccine is considered highly effective. Moderately effective will do just fine for now.""
None of the vaccine recipients in the J&J trial died from COVID-19, compared with 5 in the placebo group, the National Institutes of Health said. Three deaths in the vaccine group overall, but none were determined to be from the virus. That compares with 16 deaths overall in the placebo arm, it added.
Unlike the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, J&J's does not require a second shot weeks after the first or need to be kept frozen, making it a strong candidate for use in parts of the world where transportation and cold storage are an issue.
South African variant
Several studies have emerged this month showing that a South African variant has mutated in areas of the virus that are key targets of vaccines, reducing their efficacy.
""What we are learning is there is different efficacy in different parts of the world,"" Stoffels told Reuters.
In a sub-study of 6,000 volunteers in South Africa, Stoffels said, the J&J vaccine was 89% effective at preventing severe disease. In the South Africa portion of the trial, 95% of cases were infections with the South African variant.
""I am overwhelmed by the fact that this vaccine protected against severe disease even in South Africa,"" said Glenda Gray, the joint lead investigator of the South African vaccine trial.
Gray, who is the chief executive of the South African Medical Research Council, said this is by far the best vaccine for South Africa to fight the mutant strain and can prevent a large number of hospitalizations and deaths.
A mid-stage trial of a Novovax coronavirus vaccine in South Africa also showed lower efficacy, proving to be 60% effective among volunteers who didn't have HIV. In a separate, late-stage trial in Britain it was 89.3% effective.
In the J&J trial, which was conducted in eight countries, 44% of participants were from the United States, 41% from Central and South America and 15% from South Africa. Slightly more than a third of the volunteers were over 60.
J&J's vaccine uses a common cold virus to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response, whereas the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use a new technology called messenger RNA (mRNA). — Reuters",GMA News,2.0,0.4758000075817108,"say, vaccine, health, dose, first, government, trial, country, world, ng","['say', 'friday', 'single', 'dose', 'effective', 'prevent', 'large', 'global', 'trial', 'multiple', 'variant', 'give', 'health', 'official', 'weapon', 'tackle', 'coronavirus', 'trial', 'nearly', 'volunteer', 'level', 'protection', 'moderate', 'severe', 'varied', 'united_state', 'latin', 'america', 'south_africa', 'worry', 'variant', 'spread', 'high', 'bar', 'set', 'authorize', 'vaccine', 'moderna', 'effective', 'prevent', 'symptomatic', 'illness', 'pivotal', 'trial', 'give', 'dose', 'trial', 'however', 'conduct', 'mainly', 'united_state', 'new', 'variant', 'emerge', 'top', 'infectious', 'disease', 'specialist', 'say', 'variation', 'effectiveness', 'world', 'underline', 'need', 'vaccinate', 'many', 'people', 'quickly', 'possible', 'prevent', 'new', 'variant', 'emerge', 'story', 'villar', 'group', 'order', 'vaccine', 'employee', 'public', 'donation', 'promise', 'datum', 'soon', 'saliva', 'test', 'accurate', 'swab', 'test', 'red', 'cross', 'really', 'wake', 'call', 'nimble', 'able', 'adjust', 'virus', 'continue', 'certain', 'evolve', 'fauci', 'say', 'js', 'main', 'goal', 'prevention', 'moderate', 'severe', 'effective', 'stop', 'severe', 'disease', 'prevent', 'hospitalization', 'geography', 'multiple', 'variant', 'day', 'immunization', 'potentially', 'protect', 'hundred', 'million', 'people', 'serious', 'fatal', 'outcome', 'stoffel', 'js', 'chief', 'scientific', 'officer', 'say', 'result', 'base', 'symptomatic', 'case', 'seek', 'approval', 'plan', 'seek', 'authorization', 'food', 'next', 'week', 'say', 'plan', 'deliver', 'dose', 'produce', 'united_state', 'europe', 'south_africa', 'india', 'public', 'health', 'official', 'count', 'increase', 'much', 'need', 'supply', 'simplify', 'immunization', 'united_state', 'deal', 'buy', 'dose', 'js', 'option', 'additional', 'say', 'ready', 'immediately', 'emergency', 'approval', 'stoffel', 'decline', 'many', 'dose', 'right', 'protection', 'additional', 'great', 'key', 'overall', 'efficacy', 'specifically', 'efficacy', 'severe', 'disease', 'hospitalization', 'death', 'gellad', 'health', 'policy', 'associate', 'professor', 'university', 'pittsburgh', 'say', 'breen', 'director', 'infectious_disease', 'ophthalmology', 'research', 'firm', 'globaldata', 'say', 'country', 'still', 'desperate', 'get', 'hand', 'dose', 'regardless', 'consider', 'highly', 'effective', 'moderately', 'effective', 'fine', 'none', 'recipient', 'trial', 'die', 'compare', 'placebo', 'group', 'national', 'institutes', 'health', 'say', 'death', 'group', 'overall', 'none', 'determine', 'virus', 'compare', 'death', 'overall', 'placebo', 'arm', 'add', 'moderna', 'vaccine', 'require', 'second', 'shot', 'week', 'first', 'need', 'keep', 'frozen', 'make', 'strong', 'candidate', 'use', 'part', 'world', 'transportation', 'issue', 'south_african', 'variant', 'several', 'study', 'emerge', 'month', 'show', 'south_african', 'variant', 'mutate', 'area', 'virus', 'key', 'target', 'vaccine', 'reduce', 'efficacy', 'learn', 'different', 'efficacy', 'different', 'part', 'world', 'stoffel', 'told_reuter', 'sub', 'study', 'volunteer', 'stoffel', 'say', 'effective', 'prevent', 'severe', 'disease', 'portion', 'trial', 'case', 'infection', 'south_african', 'variant', 'overwhelmed', 'fact', 'protect', 'severe', 'disease', 'even', 'say', 'gray', 'joint', 'lead', 'investigator', 'trial', 'gray', 'south_african', 'medical', 'research', 'council', 'say', 'far', 'good', 'south_africa', 'fight', 'mutant', 'strain', 'prevent', 'large', 'number', 'death', 'mid', 'stage', 'trial', 'novovax', 'coronavirus', 'also', 'show', 'low', 'efficacy', 'prove', 'effective', 'volunteer', 'do', 'hiv', 'separate', 'late_stage', 'trial', 'britain', 'effective', 'trial', 'conduct', 'country', 'participant', 'united_state', 'central', 'south', 'america', 'slightly', 'third', 'volunteer', 'js', 'use', 'common', 'cold', 'virus', 'introduce', 'coronavirus', 'protein', 'cell', 'body', 'trigger', 'immune_response', 'moderna', 'vaccine', 'use', 'new', 'technology', 'call', 'mrna', 'reuters']",0.8989,0.123,0.715,0.162,0.47423693222200686,Positive

It quoted an AstraZeneca spokesperson as saying in a statement that the ""standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data.”
The study is testing a COVID-19 vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca and University of Oxford researchers at sites including the United States and the United Kingdom, where the adverse event was reported.
The nature of the safety issue and when it happened were not immediately known, although the participant is expected to recover, according to Stat News.
The report said suspension of the trial was having an impact on other AstraZeneca vaccine trials - as well as on clinical trials being conducted by other vaccine makers.
Nine leading US and European vaccine developers pledged on Tuesday to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their experimental vaccines despite the urgency to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
The companies, including AstraZeneca, Pfizer Inc and GlaxoSmithKline, issued what they called a ""historic pledge"" after a rise in concern that safety standards might slip in the face of political pressure to rush out a vaccine.
The companies said they would ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process as they work towards potential global regulatory filings and approvals of the first COVID-19 vaccines."".

Based on the data provided by the office of Senate Committee on Finance chairperson Sonny Angara, P8 billion of which would be under the Department of Health's regular budget.
Another P54 billion for the procurement of vaccines will be under the unprogrammed appropriations.
For its storage, transportation and distribution costs, a total of P21 billion was appropriated. These, however, would be under unprogrammed funds.
Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon has previously said funds for COVID-19 vaccines under unprogrammed appropriations can be considered ""an illusion"" since these can only be tapped if the total government revenues exceed the targets.

""No economist will stake his or her reputation by asserting that we expect to exceed our revenue targets,"" Drilon has said, pointing out the economic quagmire brought about by the pandemic.
The executive branch previously earmarked only P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccines under the National Expenditure Program. This was further increased by the House of Representatives to P8 billion.
After it was revealed during the budget deliberations that there was no fund for contact tracing efforts of the national government for 2021, the Senate allocated P1 billion for the item under the Department of the Interior and Local Government's budget.
""Ang pambansang badyet ay badyet ng pag-bangon, ang pinaka-stratehiya natin para umahon mula sa bigat at hirap ng nakaraang taon,"" Angara said.
""Considering that we’re still in the middle of a global pandemic, much of the increases the committee has made is in the health sector and with regards to our COVID-19 response,"" he added.

In Ivan Mayrina’s “24 Oras” report, the health workers said they would review data from the vaccines’ trials before deciding whether they should get one.
“Hindi naman matter sa’kin ang brand name. It’s more of kung ano ‘yung nagagawa ng vaccine for the person. So kung Sinovac, I would look into it, kung ano ‘yung mga data na available,” Dr. Shanice Esguerra said.
“I would prefer ‘yung brand na safe, effective kasi siyempre as a doctor, our decision-making is more of evidence-based,” Dr. Sam Peralta added.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque earlier sparked controversy when he said that Filipinos could not afford to be “choosy” on a COVID-19 vaccine since there is a long list of people who need to be inoculated.

Several senators later criticized Roque over the “petty” statement.
“It’s not about being choosy. It’s about thinking about your safety, lalo na po kami. Kung ang healthcare providers po, magkaroon ng masamang effect sa kanila ‘yung vaccine na ibibigay ng government, ang maaapektuhan din po is ‘yung general public,” nurse Mark Abolencia said.
The Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, meanwhile, said it was unrealistic under the current situation for Filipinos to expect that they could choose any COVID-19 vaccine they want.
“Maraming demand, maliit ang supply. So habang maliit pa ang kumot, sabi natin, matuto tayo bumaluktot. Hindi kasi ‘yan available na kapag gusto mo, makukuha mo,” Dr. Lulu Bravo said.
The following vaccines are expected to be rolled out in the country this year:
   AstraZeneca (Up to 90% efficacy, depending on dosage)
   Sputnik V (91.40% efficacy)
   Moderna (94.5% efficacy)
   Novavax
   Pfizer-BioNTech (95% efficacy)
   Sinopharm (79.34% efficacy)
   Sinovac (Less than 60% efficacy in Brazil trial, 91.% efficacy in Turkey)
Senator Sonny Angara earlier said the Moderna (P3,904 to P,4504) and Sinovac (P3,629.5) vaccines were the most expensive, while AstraZeneca (P610) and Novavax (P366) were the cheapest.

UNICEF, the UN Children's Fund, said it aims to get 520 million syringes in its warehouses by the end of this year, to guarantee an initial supply in countries ahead of the vaccine.
""The world will need as many syringes as doses of vaccine,"" UNICEF said in a statement.
UNICEF said it was also buying five million safety boxes for used syringes.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide passed 40 million on Monday, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. More than 1.1 million deaths have been recorded across the globe.

""Vaccinating the world against COVID-19 will be one of the largest mass undertakings in human history, and we will need to move as quickly as the vaccines can be produced,"" said UNICEF executive director Henrietta Fore.
""By the end of the year, we will already have over half a billion syringes pre-positioned where they can be deployed quickly and cost effectively.""
The syringes will be used by COVAX, the international coronavirus vaccine procurement, production and distribution pool created by the World Health Organization (WHO).
COVAX is run by the Gavi vaccine alliance, which will reimburse UNICEF for the syringes.
A public-private partnership, Gavi helps vaccinate half the world's children against some of the deadliest diseases on the planet.
Syringes have a five-year shelf life and tend to be shipped by sea, rather than vaccines, which are heat-sensitive and transported more quickly by air freight.
The billion syringes come on top of the 620 million that UNICEF would purchase for other vaccination programs against diseases such as measles and typhoid.
The WHO says 42 vaccine candidates are currently being tested on humans, of which 10 have reached the mass testing third and final stage.
A further 156 are being worked on in laboratories in preparation for human testing.

“Wala naman po,” he said when asked if there is something to be worried about the vaccine considering the side effects that he experienced.

“The first two days po since nabakunahan po ako, medyo hindi masyado maganda 'yung pakiramdam especially doon po sa injection site, which is hindi naman po sobrang sakit pero sobrang bigat po sa braso,” Granada said.

Two recipients of the vaccine reported anaphylactoid reactions, prompting Britain's medicine regulator to advise people with significant allergic reactions not to get the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. —KG, GMA News",GMA News,2.0,0.5579000115394592,"say, vaccine, health, dose, first, government, trial, country, world, ng","['filipino', 'nurse', 'united_kingdom', 'receive', 'say', 'side_effect', 'experience', 'alarming', 'interview', 'tv', 'edward', 'granada', 'say', 'prior', 'vaccination', 'inform', 'possible', 'side_effect', 'wala', 'naman', 'say', 'ask', 'worried', 'consider', 'side_effect', 'experience', 'accord', 'granada', 'experience', 'pain', 'injection', 'site', 'heaviness', 'arm', 'also', 'headache', 'note', 'already', 'recover', 'side_effect', 'first', 'day', 'nabakunahan', 'po', 'hindi', 'masyado', 'maganda', 'yung', 'pakiramdam', 'especially', 'doon', 'po', 'sa', 'injection', 'site', 'po', 'braso', 'granada', 'say', 'story', 'trump', 'first', 'shot', 'pfizer', 'give', 'less', 'hour', 'report', 'allergic_reaction', 'vaccine', 'cause', 'fear', 'expert', 'india', 'speed', 'review', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'vaccine', 'admit', 'skeptical', 'receive', 'first', 'first', 'skeptical', 'time', 'natatakot', 'excite', 'kasi', 'say', 'pag', 'po', 'kung', 'tutuloy', 'ba', 'hindi', 'far', 'naman', 'po', 'ngayon', 'add', 'say', 'patient', 'experience', 'allergic_reaction', 'pre', 'exist', 'allergic', 'condition', 'granada', 'say', 'receive', 'outpatient', 'department', 'area', 'vaccination', 'conduct', 'join', 'line', 'vaccination', 'granada', 'say', 'fill', 'form', 'basic', 'information', 'also', 'receive', 'brochure', 'checklist', 'include', 'question', 'pregnancy', 'medication', 'allergy', 'flu', 'vaccination', 'granada', 'say', 'set', 'receive', 'second', 'shot', 'booster', 'shot', 'filipino', 'medical', 'frontliner', 'pelayo', 'first', 'receive', 'pfizer_biontech', 'uk', 'survivor', 'pelayo', 'say', 'offer', 'vaccinate', 'decide', 'take', 'inject', 'pelayo', 'say', 'inform', 'possible', 'side_effect', 'make', 'sign', 'waiver', 'agree', 'condition', 'pelayo', 'say', 'receive', 'experienced', 'tiredness', 'however', 'pain', 'fever', 'survivor', 'say', 'extremely', 'grateful', 'uk', 'government', 'filipino', 'medical_frontliner', 'give', 'priority', 'dec', 'britain', 'become', 'first', 'country', 'world', 'approve', 'use', 'first', 'person', 'receive', 'keenan', 'vaccinate', 'local', 'hospital', 'coventry', 'central', 'england', 'filipina', 'nurse', 'parsons', 'recipient', 'report', 'anaphylactoid', 'reaction', 'prompt', 'britain', 'medicine', 'regulator', 'advise', 'people', 'significant', 'get', 'kg']",-0.9691,0.156,0.768,0.075,0.46458333333333335,Negative

“‘Di ako papayag magpabakuna dahil marami akong sakit. Baka mamatay pa ‘ko,” Magdalena Morillo said in a “24 Oras” report by Mariz Umali.
“Parang ayaw ko pang mamatay, bata pa ‘ko. Sabagay, 86 na ako. Pero nakakatakot kasi kapag naiturok na ‘yun, hindi na puwedeng ulitin. Hindi na mababawi,” another senior citizen, Janculan Nicolas, said.
Norway earlier reported that the deaths of 23 seniors were “associated” with COVID-19 vaccination. 
Health officials said the deaths appeared to be linked to the side effects of the vaccine. The Norwegian Medicines Agency also said it was possible that it was just a coincidence.

The agency stressed that such incidents are rare and only affect people who are extremely frail or have a severe illness.
Senior citizens’ rights advocate Romulo Macalintal said he was alarmed by the news but was still willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
“Unang una, dapat ding makita natin kung talagang ‘yun nga ang dahilan,” he said.
“Basta’t sinertipikahan na talagang ang isang bakuna ay puwede nang magamit dito sa ating bansa ay hindi naman ako nag-aalala na magpabakuna. Marami na rin akong nakausap na mga senior citizens… handa silang magpabakuna. Sabi nga no’ng iba naman, ang iba pag-aaralan pa nila,” he added.
Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of the Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, urged the public not to be quick to pass judgment on COVID-19 vaccines.
“Maraming edad na 60 pataas. Sabi nga natin, vulnerable sila sa iba’t ibang klase ng sakit… na posibleng mangyari with or without vaccines,” she said.
“So ‘yun ang dapat imbestigahan, kung talagang may relasyon ‘yan sa bakuna. Kasi kung wala naman, bakit mo naman i-be-blame ‘yung bakuna?

Interviewed on GMA News’ Unang Balita, Domingo said that hundreds of vaccines are being developed and some such as those from China, US, London, and Russia are already under the Phase 3 trial.
“Well, nandyan po ang posibilidad. Hindi naman siguro October kundi by end of the year,” he said.
According to Domingo, the Phase 3 trial can be finished in two to three months.
“Kapag may mga nakita tayo, depende sa resulta, makita talaga na safe and effective after the Phase 3, then it’s really possible na before the end of the year meron nang bakuna na magpaparehistro, hindi lang sa Pilipinas kundi sa ibang mga bansa,” he said.

On Wednesday, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said there is still no certainty if vaccine will be available locally by December despite the development in Russia regarding a COVID-19 vaccine
“Hindi pa po natin masabi kasi nasa Phase 3 pa lang ng clinical trials. Makikita po natin kung paano magpo-progress ito,” she said.
On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia became the first country in the world to approve a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, calling it Sputnik V.
Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte said he had accepted Putin's offer to provide the country with a vaccine against COVID-19 and that he is willing to try it for himself during clinical trials.
Citing information from a meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO), Domingo said that there were doubts on how Russia jumped to the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Ang huling update natin ay sa Russia mukhang nasa Phase 2 clinical trial pa lamang at patapos pa lamang. Kaya siguro nagulat din ang buong mundo na biglang kine-claim nila na approved na,” he said.
""Hindi natin alam kung ano 'yung approval process na nangyari sa Russia or baka talagang nag-approve na sila after Phase 2 o kung talagang na-complete nila 'yung Phase 3,’ he added.
Domingo said the FDA will get more information about the approval of the Sputnik V vaccine.
Vergeire also said that government will still subject the Russia-made vaccine against COVID-19 to regulatory procedures before clearing it for clinical trials.
Side effects
Meanwhile, in the same interview, Domingo reminded the public of the possible side effects of these vaccines being developed, saying such would depend on the type of the vaccine.
“Unang-una 'yung mga local side effects: pamamaga sa site ng injection, ‘yung pananakit ng katawan. Merong iba nagkakaroon sila ng mild symptoms: pamimigat ng katawan right after the vaccine,” he said.
Domingo assured the public that the FDA will look into these possibilities before certifying any vaccines against COVID-19. —AOL/KBK, GMA News

Interviewed on CNN Philippines, Mark Tolentino, president and CEO of MKG Universal Trading Corporation, said the price of the vaccine will be cheaper than others considering that Sinopharm is a state-owned company and the procurement will be between the Chinese and the Philippine governments.
“Hindi siya kasing mahal na pinagsasabi ng iba. Based on record, this is the most effective, pinaka-safe, and affordable na vaccine na available as of the present,” he said.
“In Malaysia, the price is $30 (more or less P1,500) per vial. This is the price in the Malaysian government. Iba naman ang Pilipinas kasi it will be subsidized by the Chinese government so possible it should be cheaper,” he added.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. has earlier said that buying Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine will be ""very problematic"" due to its hefty price at $76.

But according to Tolentino, the Sinopharm vaccine in China are actually for free. For private hospitals, the vaccine is sold at 800 Yuan or around P5,800.
“Hindi natin puwedeng i-compare 'yan sa G2G (government-to-government transaction) natin because approximately kapag G2G it should be cheaper because may diplomatic relationship involved,” he said.
“Possible 'yan, i-subsidize po ng Chinese government,” he added.
Tolentino also pointed out that Sinopharm has a higher efficacy rate on Asian recipients at 79%, compared to other vaccines such as those from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna.
Tolentino said that Sinopharm has not applied yet for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines because the government has not expressed its intention yet to negotiate with the Chinese government.
“Sinopharm is not yet applying for emergency use authorization because Sinopharm-China is waiting for the intent of the Philippines to whether or not Philippines would buy Sinopharm vaccines,” he said. —KBK, GMA News",GMA News,4.0,0.6812999844551086,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['sinopharm', 'distributor', 'tuesday', 'say', 'chinese', 'pharmaceutical_firm', 'affordable', 'contrary', 'claim', 'pricey', 'compare', 'vaccine', 'interview', 'mark', 'tolentino', 'president', 'ceo', 'universal', 'trading', 'corporation', 'say', 'price', 'cheap', 'other', 'consider', 'sinopharm', 'state_owne', 'company', 'procurement', 'chinese', 'government', 'hindi', 'siya', 'kasing', 'mahal', 'na', 'pinagsasabi', 'ng', 'iba', 'base', 'record', 'effective', 'pinaka', 'safe', 'affordable', 'na', 'na', 'available', 'present', 'say', 'malaysia', 'price', 'less', 'vial', 'price', 'malaysian', 'government', 'iba', 'naman', 'ang', 'pilipinas', 'kasi', 'subsidize', 'chinese', 'government', 'possible', 'cheap', 'add', 'czar', 'early', 'say', 'buy', 'sinopharm', 'problematic', 'due', 'hefty', 'price', 'story', 'distributor', 'unregistered', 'sinopharm', 'vax', 'dami', 'trust', 'vaccine', 'galvez', 'appeal', 'public', 'conduct', 'vaccination', 'dry', 'run', 'accord', 'tolentino', 'sinopharm', 'actually', 'free', 'private', 'hospital', 'sell', 'yuan', 'hindi', 'natin', 'puwedeng', 'compare', 'yan', 'sa', 'government', 'government', 'transaction', 'natin', 'approximately', 'kapag', 'cheap', 'diplomatic', 'relationship', 'involve', 'say', 'possible', 'yan', 'subsidize', 'po', 'chinese', 'government', 'add', 'tolentino', 'also', 'point', 'sinopharm', 'high', 'efficacy_rate', 'asian', 'recipient', 'compare', 'vaccine', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'moderna', 'tolentino', 'say', 'sinopharm', 'apply', 'yet', 'government', 'express', 'intention', 'yet', 'negotiate', 'chinese', 'government', 'sinopharm', 'yet', 'apply', 'authorization', 'sinopharm', 'china', 'wait', 'intent', 'buy', 'sinopharm', 'vaccine', 'say', 'kbk']",0.7269,0.037,0.892,0.072,0.40364197530864193,Positive

""Drug pusher, wala kayo,"" Duterte, who launched the so-called war on drugs, said.
""'Yun ang utos ko. 'Yan ang gusto ko. Hindi maganda? Hindi talaga maganda. Mga tao, hindi pala tao sila, tingin ko [sa] mga drug pusher, drug lord, aso. Tingin ko sa kanila... hindi ako magtulong sa inyo, sinisira niyo ang Pilipinas, pinapatay niyo ang tao,"" he added.

""Even if you announce that you are an NPA, it's okay. Wala munang... pagamot ka muna, pa-vaccinate ka, para mahusay kang lumaban sa puwersa ko,"" he said.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said 20 million Filipinos will be provided with a COVID-19 vaccine for free. The poorest of the poor will be prioritized as the government commits P20 billion for vaccines at $10 per dose.
Senator Christopher Lawrence ""Bong"" Go, chair of the Senate committee on health, agreed that the marginalized sectors must be prioritized.
""Unahin 'yung mga mahihirap... sila po [ay] most vulnerable. Ibig ko sabihin, sila ‘yung andiyan sa kalye at sila po ‘yung madaling tamaan ng sakit na kadalasan po asymptomatic na hindi nila alam ay tinamaan na sila ng virus dahil hindi sila makapag-test kaya napapabayaan,"" he said in a statement.
Senator Sherwin Gatchalian also stressed it is imperative that a budget is allocated for the COVID-19 vaccine in Congress' deliberations on the 2021 General Appropriations Act.
""My own estimate we will be needing approximately 230 billion to buy 100 million vaccines,"" he said.
""We have to be ready with the money to buy because it’s important that we have the financial capability to buy the vaccine in case it comes already,"" he added.
The Philippines has yet to enter into a final agreement when it comes to the number of anti-COVID-19 vaccines that will be available to Filipinos, according to the Department of Health.
Exercise prudence, learn from Dengvaxia
The Food and Drug Administration is expected to exercise rigor in approving COVID-19 vaccines that will be given to Filipinos, according to Villanueva.
Citing information from the World Health Organization, the senator said six vaccines are in the third phase of clinical trials.
""Not to be overly optimistic, we wish that there will be transparency in the experimental results of these vaccines,"" he said.
""We know the urgency to have a vaccine as soon as possible but there are risks attached to fast-tracking the development of vaccines that normally takes 10 years to produce,"" he added.
Senator Nancy Binay also said the DOH should learn from the Dengvaxia experience.
""When it comes to vaccines, government must take the right approach to public health safety, and provide the highest degree of prudence. Although it is very encouraging to know that there are vaccines being developed, the public needs more information as to how these work and respond, and the potential risks they may have,"" she said.
Binay underscored that immunization is just one aspect of protecting the public's health.
""Pagdating sa prevention, mas mahalaga pa rin ang pagpapatupad ng sensible, basic health protocols tulad ng social distancing, pagsusuot ng face mask, at paghuhugas ng kamay,"" she said.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far issued emergency use authorizations on two COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.

""We have already allocated an initial P500 million for the purchase of vaccines. This is already allotted during our 2021 budget [deliberation],"" Ebrahim said in a Foreign Correspondents Association of the Philippines' online conference.
""We are also looking forward that the national government will extend some assistance to us but on our side, we have some preparations,"" he added.
BARMM's parliament has approved a total of P75.6-billion budget for 2021.
Part of the Bangsamoro region's annual budget is sourced from the block grant from the national government, which is given yearly to the region as mandated under Section 15 of the Bangsamoro Organic Law.

In a press conference, FDA director general Eric Domingo said the vaccination of military personnel using unauthorized vaccines, which are now said to be donated, did not go through the process of clearance.
“The Department of Health [DOH] kasi does accept donations, like for food and drugs. But, usually if they are foreign donations, they go through the Bureau of Internal Health Cooperation,” he said.
“Then, the BIHC of the DOH coordinates with the FDA to get the necessary clearances for them to be able to brought it to the country. In this case, I do not think there was any process that was done,” he added.
According to Health Secretary Duque, these kinds of donations are usually requested.

“These could be donated by outside entity. These will be sent through proper channel,” he added.
On Tuesday, Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said that the vaccines administered to members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) were probably donated, considering the sale and distribution of them are illegal.
""For the PSG soldiers, mostly those who are protecting the President. And let's make it clear no: These vaccines are probably donated by someone who has access to that particular country,” Año said.
“There has been no commercial distribution, more on voluntary on the part of the soldiers,"" he added.
Philippine laws prohibit the manufacturing, importation, exportation, sale, distribution, and non-consumer use of unregistered products, according to FDA.
Violating manufacturers, importers, and distributors will be fined from P500,000 to P5 million.

In her weekly radio show, Robredo lamented how the Dengvaxia scare eroded public trust in vaccination.
“Napakahirap noon kasi taon iyong ginugol para makahanap din ng lunas doon sa sakit na iyon, makahanap ng vaccine—tapos dahil sa irresponsible na pag-iingay… parang iniimpluwensiyahan mo iyong pag-isip ng tao na iyong desisyon na magiging mali,” she said.
In 2017, pharmaceutical company Sanofi warned that its Dengvaxia vaccine could cause severe illness in the long run among patients who had not contracted dengue before vaccination.
Public Attorney’s Office chief Persida Acosta was later accused of initiating public hysteria following Sanofi’s announcement, causing trust in vaccines to plummet.

The private company União Quimica said on Friday that it was bound by a confidentiality agreement not to give any technical or scientific details. It still must obtain approval from Brazil's health regulator Anvisa.
This is the second agreement to produce the Russian vaccine in Brazil, where four other vaccines are already being tested.
The Russian vaccine is being developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Research Institute and marketed by the RDIF, which last month also entered an agreement with the Brazilian state of Paraná to test and produce the vaccine.
The Brazilian state of Bahia has also signed an agreement to conduct Phase III clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine and plans to buy 50 million doses to market in northeastern Brazil.

Senate President Vicente Sotto III said the next hearing will be held on Friday, January 22, at 10 a.m., and tasked Senator Panfilo Lacson to prepare a shortlist of resource persons.
Friday's event will follow two hours-long hearings held last week in which senators pressed officials in charge of securing the shots on the terms of their agreements with vaccine manufacturers.
Amid criticism that the government is partial to vaccines from China, National Task Force Against COVID-19 chief Carlito Galvez Jr. said that they are negotiating with pharmaceutical company Sinovac to get the ""best price.""
Earlier, Senate Finance Committee chairperson Sonny Angara provided a list of available vaccines worldwide that bared Sinovac’s price at P3,629 for two doses, which is higher compared with Pfizer-BioNTech (P2,379); Gamaleya (P1,220);  COVAX Facility (P854);  AstraZeneca (P610); and Novavax (P366).
But on Sunday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that each dose of Sinovac's vaccine would cost more or less P650 only.
""I can assure you that in our negotiation, the prices relative to our neighbors are fair and considered the best price,"" Galvez said on Saturday.
The government has not disclosed the actual price, citing a confidentiality with the manufacturer.
But Lacson, in a privilege speech, said other countries have been open about vaccine prices.
""I could not understand for the life of me why we are being kept in the dark when it comes to our price negotiations with Sinovac, while our neighboring countries could not be more transparent about it,"" he said. 
Earlier in the day, Sinovac Biotech General Manager Helen Yang said the COVID-19 vaccine will be provided to the Philippine government at a reasonable price.
""Definitely we are not the highest expensive ones because the mission for Sinovac is to provide the vaccine at an affordable price,"" Yang said in an interview on CNN- Philippines.
""For [the] Philippines, we do committed to provide a favorable price but unfortunately, I'm not in the position to discuss this confidential information at this moment. But I will be assuring you that this is a very good price that we provided to the Philippines,"" she added. — RSJ, GMA News

The two companies earlier on Monday became the first drugmakers to release successful trial data, saying their vaccine was shown to be more than 90% effective, a major victory in the fight against the pandemic.
""We should be more optimistic that the immunization effect can last for at least a year,"" CEO Ugur Sahin told Reuters.
While it was not yet known how long the protection would last, he said research on recovered patients had shown that those with high antibodies levels to begin with have not experienced a sharp drop in those levels, and the same would likely go for vaccinated people.
Highlighting the logistical challenge of distributing the vaccine, which belongs to a class known as messenger RNA, the arrangement for the first three months would be that the genetic compound would have to be shipped and centrally stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius.

LAGRIMAS,2021-01-18 19:49:00,"Senator Panfilo Lacson on Monday said he suspects an attempt to overprice the vaccine produced by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac.
In a privilege speech, Laccon said that the ""original price"" of Sinovac's product, at P3,629 or $38 for two doses or P1,814 or $19 for one dose, had it pushed through compared to $5 price in Thailand, spells a price difference of P16.8 billion for 25 million doses.
Amid questions on the price and efficacy of Sinovac's vaccine, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said that the Philippines has secured 25 million doses of the product and that 50,000 doses will arrive by February.
COVID-19 response officials later said this was not yet final as experts and the state regulator have yet to approve the product for use in the country.
""That being said, I am not prepared to accuse anyone in particular of corruption,"" Lacson said.

""Rather, it defies logic to suspect at least an attempt to overprice the vaccine. Again, when there is an attempt at overpricing, isn’t it also logical to think na may kikita ng limpak-limpak na salapi?"" he added.
Lacson said it was ""well and good"" if it is true that the government has brought down the cost from around P1,800 to P650 per dose.
""We can say that the Senate, through the Committee of the Whole hearings triggered by Sen. Kiko Pangilinan’s Senate resolution has done its fair share in protecting the public coffers and saving our people billions of pesos in the national vaccination program,"" he said.
He also cited the effort of netizens to demand transparency from officials negotiating with Sinovac.
Earlier, Senate Finance Committee chairperson Sonny Angara provided a list of available vaccines worldwide that bared Sinovac’s price at P3,629 for two doses, which is higher compared with Pfizer-BioNTech (P2,379); Gamaleya (P1,220); COVAX Facility (P854); AstraZeneca (P610); and Novavax (P366).
He explained that these figures came from the Department of Health, which has clarified that these are not yet the negotiated prices.
On Sunday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that each dose of Sinovac's vaccine would cost just around P650.
Officials have not disclosed the actual price, citing a confidentiality agreement with Sinovac.

In a radio interview on Saturday, Angara said it is possible for Congress not to hold the bicameral meeting anymore for Senate Bill 2057 and House Bill 8648, which both provide for the indemnification fund and the speedy COVID-19 vaccine procurement.
Both bills have also been certified as urgent by President Rodrigo Duterte.
""Posible rin 'yung wala nang bicam sapagkat it's a possibility na i-adopt na lang 'yung isang version ng isang Kamara, mas mapapabilis 'yung pagsasabatas nitong Senate Bill 2057, 'yung vaccination act,"" he said.
Senate Bill 2057 seeks to authorize the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to undertake negotiated procurement of COVID-19 vaccines and the ancillary supplies and services for their storage, transport, and distribution.

It also allows local government units to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies and services in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through multiparty agreements.
The LGUs will be allowed to make advance payments but they can only purchase vaccines and supplies for up to 50% of their target population. The 50% cap may be adjusted by the IATF depending on the supply.
A P500-million COVID-19 National Indemnity Fund will also be established under the measure and will only be used to compensate any inoculated person who will experience severe adverse effects or worse, death. 
Angara said the certification of urgency from the President will help in allowing Congress to fast-track the approval of the measure.
Certifying a bill as urgent allows Congress to approve the measure on second and third reading on the same day.
""Maaaring mangyari 'yan (approval) sa Lunes, maaaring sa Martes o sa Miyerkoles,"" Angara said.
""Pero siyempre, 'yun nga, medyo nagmamadali 'yung ating mga local government units sapagkat sila ay nababahala na hindi mapasa ito dahil February 24 ang kanilang deadline dito sa bayaran nila sa AstraZeneca. 'Yun ang kinontrata nila para magbigay ng bakuna sa kanila,"" he added.
If ever the measure is not enacted into law by February 24, Angara said a provision may be included to allow for its retroactive application.
""Ibig sabihin kahit 'yung mga kontrata ay nangyari before naging batas itong Senate Bill 2057, sakop pa rin niya 'yung mga kontrata na pinirmahan before ipasa ang batas,"" he said.

The two companies said they had submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Monday seeking ""Conditional Marketing Authorization (CMA)"" for their vaccine.
The move comes after large-scale tests showed their vaccine was 95 percent effective against Covid-19 and triggered no serious side effects.
If approved by the Amsterdam-based EMA, the vaccine could potentially be rolled out ""in Europe before the end of 2020"", the companies said in a statement.
Pfizer and BioNTech already filed for emergency use authorization with the US Food and Drug Administration on November 20.

If US regulators give the green light, Americans could start getting vaccinated around mid-December.
UK regulators are also screening the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine.
""We have known since the beginning of this journey that patients are waiting, and we stand ready to ship Covid-19 vaccine doses as soon as potential authorizations will allow us,"" Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said.
A fellow frontrunner in the global vaccine race, US biotech company Moderna, said on Monday that it had sought emergency regulatory approval for its Covid-19 shot in both the United States and Europe.
The Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines are both based on a new technology that uses mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) to deliver genetic material to the body that makes human cells create a protein from the virus.
This trains the immune system to be ready to attack if it encounters the novel coronavirus.
But Moderna's vaccine can be kept in long term storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus four degrees Fahrenheit) while Pfizer's requires minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit).
The two vaccines have been developed at breathtaking speed as part of an unprecedented effort to end a pandemic that has infected more than 62 million people worldwide and killed more than 1.4 million.

""In other words, it's best to have whatever vaccine is available as soon as possible. And when there's a new one coming and it's time for you to get that shot, you'll get that shot,"" he added.
Romualdez assured the public that the Philippine government is working to get ""as many vaccines as possible.""

“Ito ay ini-evaluate natin ngayon at mukhang kaunting panahon na lang naman siguro at may ibang requirement na lang ang hinihingi natin para ma-approve natin ang clinical trial na 'to,” he added.
In October, the DOST said the Sputnik V, Janssen, Sinovac, and COVAX-19 have expressed intent to undergo clinical trials in the Philippines.
Aside from these, Philippine Council for Health Research Development executive director Dr. Jaime Montoya noted that more vaccines will have their clinical trials in the country under the World Health Organization Solidarity Trial. -MDM, GMA News",GMA News,4.0,0.5090000033378601,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['manufacturer', 'least', 'potential', 'product', 'conduct', 'clinical_trial', 'accord', 'food', 'drug', 'administration', 'public', 'briefing', 'thursday', 'health', 'undersecretary', 'note', 'advantage', 'conduct', 'clinical_trial', 'pag', 'sa', 'meeting', 'namin', 'kanina', 'department', 'science', 'technology', 'mga', 'lima', 'na', 'yung', 'nag', 'signify', 'ng', 'intention', 'maggawa', 'ng', 'clinical', 'trial', 'dito', 'say', 'yung', 'mga', 'magki', 'clinical', 'trial', 'dito', 'bentahe', 'dahil', 'talaga', 'magiging', 'ng', 'ito', 'ate', 'sa', 'mga', 'pilipino', 'mismo', 'add', 'accord', 'potential', 'vaccine', 'sinovac', 'already', 'clear', 'department', 'science', 'technology', 'currently', 'evaluation', 'fda', 'story', 'tolentino', 'worry', 'sad', 'state', 'fda', 'enforcement', 'unit', 'gordon', 'philhealth', 'pay', 'debt', 'red', 'cross', 'incur', 'new', 'expense', 'sign', 'accord', 'asean', 'country', 'address', 'non', 'tariff', 'measure', 'isa', 'po', 'actually', 'endorse', 'na', 'ng', 'ng', 'dost', 'sa', 'fda', 'ito', 'po', 'yung', 'sinovac', 'say', 'evaluate', 'natin', 'ngayon', 'mukhang', 'kaunte', 'panahon', 'lang', 'naman', 'siguro', 'ibang', 'requirement', 'na', 'hinihingi', 'natin', 'para', 'approve', 'ang', 'clinical', 'trial', 'add', 'october', 'dost', 'say', 'sputnik', 'sinovac', 'covax', 'express', 'intent', 'undergo', 'clinical_trial', 'council', 'health', 'research', 'development', 'executive', 'director', 'note', 'vaccine', 'clinical_trial', 'country', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'mdm']",-0.9136,0.114,0.845,0.04,0.43677685950413214,Negative

""The reopening of businesses should be staggered and based on which LGUs have already implemented their respective COVID-19 vaccine plans,"" Biazon said in a statement.
""This way, we can ensure that the patrons going to these businesses will not be at risk for infection to the coronavirus and become unknowing vectors.""
Biazon issued the statement amid the government's plan to reopen leisure establishments such as cinemas, museums, and video and interactive game arcades -- a plan opposed by several sectors, including local officials.
The lawmaker pointed out that the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IAFT) should synchronize the opening of sectors in the economy with that of the COVID-19 vaccine plan for that specific sector.

""We should identify sectors in the economy to open up, and the reopening should be tied in with a vaccination plan for that sector. This will help boost not just immunity, but more importantly, the confidence of consumers to actually patronize those businesses,” Biazon said.
He said if businesses were opened without a ""confidence-building measure"" such as a concrete vaccination plan, ""the consumer response may not be enough to sustain the overhead cost.""
Biazon added that this could also lead to a surge of COVID-19 infections.
Some mayors in Metro Manila have expressed apprehension on the reopening of leisure establishments, saying it is still risky for the public as the threat of COVID-19 is still there.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque announced that the reopening of traditional cinemas in areas under general community quarantine would be in March pending the release of guidelines on COVID-19 safety protocols. —Anna Felicia Bajo/KBK, GMA News

Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine, and did so before large-scale trials were complete, stirring concerns among scientists and doctors about the safety and efficacy of the shot.
An Emergency Use Listing (EUL) is meant to make a vaccine available globally faster, while a WHO prequalification is a global quality tag that ensures vaccines are safe and effective.
The procedures would allow Sputnik V to be included in the list of medical products that meet leading quality, safety and efficacy standards, RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said in a statement.
The vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Research Institute and marketed by RDIF, is based on a platform of human adenoviral vectors. -- Reuters

PANTI,2021-01-14 12:02:00,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech, FDA Director General Eric Domingo announced on Thursday.
""After thorough review, the FDA is granting EUA to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19. The interim data from the ongoing Phase 3 trial shows the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 95% in the study population and at least 92% among all racial groups. The EUA means the benefits outweigh the known and potential risks,” Domingo said.
""This is effective immediately,"" he added.
Domingo said Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine can be administered to people 16 years old and above.
This decision makes Pfizer-BioNTech’s product as the first ever COVID-19 vaccine which can be legally administered in the Philippines.

Likewise, Domingo said that Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine side effects were found to be transient, mild to moderate, and similar to common vaccine reactions.
“No specific safety concerns were identified,"" he said.
Domingo then clarified that these observations were made during a limited period of two-month long follow up, and that more adverse effects may emerge.
As such, Domingo said the Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 must only be administered by health professionals who have the resources and are trained to recognize and manage such side effects.
“Close surveillance and monitoring is needed after immunization,” he said.
Domingo said that the issuance of the  EUA, however, is not a certificate of product registration and as such, cannot be sold commercially.
According to Domingo, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has been administered on five billion people in the world so far.
Pfizer-BioNTech requires an ultra cold storage of -70 to-80 degrees Celsius, a facility that can only be provided in  Metro Manila as well as in Cebu and Davao cities.
Sinovac
At the same briefing, Domingo said Chinese firm Sinovac has applied for emergency use authorization before the FDA.
“Yesterday, nag-submit ng application ang Sinovac,” Domingo said during a virtual briefing.
Domingo, however, said that Sinovac has yet to complete submission of requirements needed to secure an EUA. — KBK/RSJ, GMA News

Galvez said three more agreements on COVID-19 vaccines were being polished in terms of indemnity provisions to ensure compensation for individuals who develop serious side effects.
“Actually, ‘yun talaga ang medyo tedious kasi talagang ang gusto po talaga ng ibang mga manufacturer full blanket,"" Galvez said in the weekly briefing chaired by President Rodrigo Duterte.
""Absolution?"" Duterte asked. ""Opo, kasama po doon,"" Galvez said.
Galvez said he was wary of willful neglect and malpractice on the part pharmaceutical firms.

“Dapat malaman po ng mamayan at saka ng mga manufacturers na this state cannot waive ‘yung tinatawag na blanket immunity na ang ano po natin na malpractices atsaka willful neglect,” Galvez said.
“Kasi unfair po sa atin na sa isang manufacturer na isu-surrender po natin ‘yun dahil parang pag ka… may mangyari na meron silang malpractices, parang kawawa naman po ‘yung ating mamayan na talagang mahihirapan na makapag-ano po ng indemnity,” he added.
The Senate has approved on second and third reading the measure seeking to expedite the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines and establish a vaccine P500-million indemnity fund.
The House of Representatives has adopted the Senate measure.
Even with an indemnity fund, however,  Galvez said negotiations should be fair.
“Dapat fair and square sa negotiation table. It is fair for us na dapat ilaban natin sa manufacturer na kailangan fair din po sila na kailangan i-maintain din po nila ‘yung specification na required na de-deliver nila sa vaccine is safe and effective,” Galvez said.

Separately, the US also said it was providing $450 million to Regeneron for its experimental COVID-19 treatment and prophylaxis, a combination of two antibodies.
Under the terms of its agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Department of Defense, Novavax agrees to deliver 100 million doses of its vaccine, potentially by the end of the year.
""We are honored to partner with Operation Warp Speed to move our vaccine candidate forward with extraordinary urgency in the quest to provide vital protection to our nation's population,"" said Stanley Erck, the company's president and CEO.
The final stage Phase 3 trial of its vaccine, called NVX-CoV2373, is set to take place this fall.

The Maryland-based company uses insect cells to grow synthesized pieces of the SARS-CoV-2's ""spike protein,"" which the virus uses to invade cells, in order to trigger the human body's immune response. 
It also uses an ""adjuvant,"" a compound that boosts the production of neutralizing antibodies.
In the spring, the company said it had proven the efficacy of a seasonal flu vaccine it had developed using similar technology.
The amount awarded to Novavax by the US is higher than the $1.2 billion given to the Oxford University vaccine that is being developed by AstraZeneca.
Under Operation Warp Speed, the US is aiming to deliver millions of doses of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 in 2021.
Also Tuesday, the US said it was providing New York-state based Regeneron with $450 million to scale up manufacture of its COVID0-19 antibody treatment.
The company, which announced on Monday it was entering late stage human trials, estimates that it could have between 70,000 and 300,000 treatment doses, with the first available by late summer.
The drug, called REGN-COV2, is a combination of two antibodies that block the coronavirus' spike protein.
Regeneron scientists evaluated thousands of antibodies harvested from genetically-modified mice with human immune systems and from humans, identifying the two they found to be most potent, while not competing against each other.
The company uses a multi-antibody strategy to decrease the chances that the virus will mutate in order to evade the blocking action of a single antibody, an approach it detailed in a recent study in Science.
Last year, a triple antibody cocktail developed by Regeneron was shown to be effective against the Ebola virus.  -Agence France-Presse",GMA News,0.0,0.6506999731063843,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['tuesday', 'announce', 'provide', 'funding', 'development', 'manufacture', 'candidate', 'produce', 'biotech', 'firm', 'large', 'amount', 'award', 'speed', 'separately', 'also', 'say', 'provide', 'regeneron', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'prophylaxis', 'combination', 'antibody', 'term', 'agreement', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'hhs', 'department', 'defense', 'novavax', 'agree', 'deliver', 'dose', 'potentially', 'end', 'year', 'honor', 'partner', 'speed', 'move', 'candidate', 'forward', 'extraordinary', 'urgency', 'quest', 'provide', 'vital', 'protection', 'nation', 'population', 'say', 'erck', 'company', 'president', 'ceo', 'final', 'stage', 'phase', 'trial', 'call', 'nvx', 'cov', 'set', 'take', 'place', 'fall', 'story', 'dip', 'day', 'run', 'fear', 'virus', 'surge', 'dubai', 'hotel', 'ready', 'welcome', 'foreign', 'visitor', 'emirate', 'reopen', 'dswd', 'pack', 'food', 'bag', 'day', 'exec', 'tell', 'house', 'panel', 'maryland', 'base', 'company', 'use', 'insect', 'cell', 'grow', 'synthesize', 'piece', 'spike_protein', 'virus', 'use', 'invade', 'cell', 'order', 'trigger', 'human', 'bodys', 'immune_response', 'also', 'use', 'adjuvant', 'compound', 'boost', 'production', 'spring', 'company', 'say', 'prove', 'efficacy', 'seasonal', 'flu', 'develop', 'use', 'similar', 'technology', 'amount', 'award', 'novavax', 'high', 'give', 'oxford_university', 'develop', 'astrazeneca', 'speed', 'aim', 'deliver', 'million', 'dose', 'safe', 'effective', 'vaccine', 'also', 'tuesday', 'say', 'provide', 'state', 'base', 'regeneron', 'scale', 'manufacture', 'antibody', 'treatment', 'company', 'announce', 'monday', 'enter', 'late_stage', 'human', 'trial', 'estimate', 'treatment', 'dose', 'first', 'available', 'late', 'summer', 'drug', 'call', 'regn', 'cov', 'combination', 'antibody', 'block', 'coronavirus', 'spike_protein', 'regeneron', 'scientist', 'evaluate', 'thousand', 'antibody', 'harvest', 'genetically', 'modify', 'mouse', 'human', 'immune', 'system', 'human', 'identify', 'find', 'potent', 'compete', 'company', 'use', 'multi', 'antibody', 'strategy', 'decrease', 'chance', 'virus', 'mutate', 'order', 'evade', 'block', 'action', 'single', 'antibody', 'approach', 'detail', 'recent', 'study', 'science', 'last', 'year', 'triple', 'antibody', 'cocktail', 'develop', 'regeneron', 'show', 'effective', 'virus', 'agence_france', 'presse']",0.9788,0.044,0.799,0.156,0.4719285714285714,Positive

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia had reached a deal with Swedish-British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to receive the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Oxford University.
""The Oxford vaccine is one of the most advanced and promising in the world, and under this deal we have secured early access for every Australian,"" he said.
""If this vaccine proves successful we will manufacture and supply vaccines straight away under our own steam and make it free for 25 million Australians.""
The Oxford vaccine is one of five globally in Phase 3 efficacy trials, and researchers hope to have results by the end of the year.

It is the first such deal for Australia, and Morrison said his government was also in talks with ""many parties around the world"" over other potential vaccines as well as supporting local scientists in their efforts.
The country is yet to reach a final agreement with AstraZeneca on the cost, and a local manufacturer has not been locked in.
However, Australia has signed an Aus$25 million ($18 million) agreement with American medical technology company Becton Dickinson to buy 100 million needles and syringes to administer the doses.
Although none of the coronavirus vaccines under development has proved its efficacy yet in clinical trials, at least 5.7 billion doses have been pre-ordered around the world.

Five vaccines -- three Western and two Chinese -- are in Phase 3 efficacy trials involving thousands of people, including the Oxford vaccine.

AstraZeneca has also signed agreements to provide doses to the US, Europe and Brazil.
Another deal struck by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, would see India manufacture the Oxford vaccine for distribution in 57 low- and middle-income countries.

First shipments of a COVID-19 vaccine created by Western laboratories have often been snapped up by the United States.

Morrison said Australia remained ""committed"" to ensuring early access to the potential vaccine for Pacific countries and regional partners in Southeast Asia.

Earlier this month he called on nations to share potential vaccines, saying any country that discovered one and did not make it available globally ""would be judged terribly by history"".

Australia has recorded almost 24,000 cases of COVID-19 and 438 fatalities to date.

Early in the pandemic it was considered among the most successful at curbing the virus's spread until an outbreak in Melbourne, the country's second-biggest city, that authorities struggled to contain.

The outbreak -- which was traced back to two hotels being used to quarantine travellers returning from overseas -- has ravaged aged-care homes in the city, causing dozens of deaths.

An overnight curfew, mandatory mask-wearing and the shutdown of non-essential businesses now appear to be bringing the virus under control, with the number of new daily cases falling below 300 in recent days. -Agence France-Presse",GMA News,3.0,0.5253000259399414,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['australia', 'secure', 'access', 'promising', 'potential', 'coronavirus', 'prime', 'minister', 'announce', 'tuesday', 'say', 'country', 'manufacture', 'offer', 'free', 'dose', 'entire', 'population', 'prime', 'minister', 'say', 'australia', 'reach', 'deal', 'swedish', 'british', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'astrazeneca', 'receive', 'develop', 'oxford_university', 'advanced', 'promising', 'world', 'deal', 'secure', 'early', 'access', 'australian', 'say', 'prove', 'successful', 'manufacture', 'supply', 'vaccine', 'straight', 'away', 'steam', 'make', 'free', 'australian', 'oxford', 'globally', 'phase', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'researcher', 'hope', 'result', 'end', 'year', 'story', 'ncr', 'contact_trace', 'barely', 'improve', 'mecq', 'magalong', 'sc', 'court', 'gcq', 'area', 'physically', 'open', 'motorcycle', 'rider', 'home', 'gcq', 'area', 'ride', 'san', 'barrier', 'first', 'deal', 'australia', 'morrison', 'say', 'government', 'also', 'talk', 'many', 'party', 'world', 'potential', 'vaccine', 'well', 'support', 'local', 'scientist', 'effort', 'country', 'yet', 'reach', 'final', 'agreement', 'astrazeneca', 'cost', 'local', 'manufacturer', 'lock', 'however', 'australia', 'sign', 'aus', 'agreement', 'american', 'medical', 'technology', 'company', 'becton', 'dickinson', 'buy', 'needle', 'syrinx', 'administer', 'dose', 'none', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'development', 'prove', 'efficacy', 'clinical_trial', 'least', 'dose', 'pre', 'order', 'world', 'vaccine', 'western', 'chinese', 'phase', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'involve', 'thousand', 'people', 'include', 'oxford', 'astrazeneca', 'also', 'sign', 'agreement', 'provide', 'dose', 'europe', 'deal', 'strike', 'gavi', 'alliance', 'see', 'india', 'manufacture', 'oxford', 'distribution', 'low', 'country', 'first', 'shipment', 'create', 'western', 'laboratory', 'often', 'snap', 'united_state', 'morrison', 'say', 'australia', 'remain', 'committed', 'ensure', 'early', 'access', 'potential', 'pacific', 'country', 'regional', 'partner', 'early', 'month', 'call', 'nation', 'share', 'potential', 'vaccine', 'say', 'country', 'discover', 'make', 'available', 'globally', 'judge', 'terribly', 'history', 'australia', 'record', 'almost', 'case', 'fatality', 'date', 'early', 'pandemic', 'consider', 'successful', 'curb', 'viruss', 'spread', 'outbreak', 'melbourne', 'countrys', 'second', 'big', 'city', 'authority', 'struggle', 'contain', 'outbreak', 'trace', 'hotel', 'use', 'quarantine', 'traveller', 'return', 'overseas', 'ravage', 'aged', 'care', 'home', 'city', 'cause', 'dozen', 'death', 'overnight', 'curfew', 'mandatory', 'mask', 'wear', 'shutdown', 'non', 'essential', 'business', 'appear', 'bring', 'virus', 'control', 'number', 'new', 'daily', 'case', 'fall', 'recent', 'day', 'agence_france', 'presse']",0.9913,0.06,0.723,0.217,0.3936710858585859,Positive

The late-stage trials of the experimental vaccine, developed with researchers from the University of Oxford, were suspended this week after an illness in a study subject in Britain, casting doubts on an early rollout.
""On 6 September, the standard review process triggered a voluntary pause to vaccination across all global trials to allow review of safety data by independent committees, and international regulators,"" AstraZeneca said.
It added that safety reviewers had recommended to Britain's Medicines Health Regulatory Authority (MHRA) that it was safe to resume the British trials.
The patient involved in the study had been reportedly suffering from neurological symptoms associated with a rare spinal inflammatory disorder called transverse myelitis.

AstraZeneca, based in Cambridge, said it could not disclose further medical information.
""The Company will continue to work with health authorities across the world and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume to provide the vaccine broadly, equitably and at no profit during this pandemic,"" AstraZeneca said.
It declined to elaborate further on when other global trials were expected to restart.
The Serum Institute of India said it would restart its trials once it had permission from the Drugs Controller General of India.
Brazil's health regulator ANVISA said it was awaiting notice from the British MHRA confirming that resumption of trials has been authorized before resuming in Brazil.
The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is conducting the paused trials, said in a statement that 4,600 of the planned 5,000 volunteers have been recruited and vaccinated without any of them reporting any serious health issues.
Governments around the world are desperate for a vaccine to help end the pandemic, which has caused more than 900,000 deaths and global economic turmoil. The World Health Organization (WHO) had flagged AstraZeneca's as the most promising.
The vaccine is in late-stage clinical trials in the United States, Britain, Brazil and South Africa and additional trials are planned in Japan and Russia.
'Wake-up call'
The pause of the trials came after reports that the United States was aiming for fast-track authorization or approval of a vaccine before November's presidential election.
Leading US and European vaccine developers have pledged to uphold scientific safety and efficacy standards for their experimental vaccines and not bow to political pressures to rush the process.
AstraZeneca has already agreed to supply close to three billion doses to governments across the globe — more than any other vaccine project.
The WHO's chief scientist said the pause in the trials should serve as a ""wake-up"" call that there would be ups and downs in the development of a vaccine.
""Inevitably with such a large trial there will be times when safety issues arise,"" said Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London.

“We need to ensure that all of these vaccines are safe and they are efficacious before we allow it to be sold or procured by the government,” Health Undersecretary Ma. Rosario Vergeire said in a report on State of the Nation with Jessica Soho.
Scientists and medical experts around the world have been working double time to develop a vaccine to end the pandemic, with a promising few entering clinical trials.

President Rodrigo Duterte earlier said he would give preference to the vaccines being developed by Russia and China because other countries are asking for advance payment.

“That’s the one thing that’s wrong with Western companies. Kaya sabi ko we will give preference to Russia and China provided that their vaccine is as good as any other in the market,” Duterte had said.

Russia had said it is open to the possibility of producing locally the anti-COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V for the Philippines.
The country is participating in the phase 3 clinical trials for Sputnik V.
Given the country's scarce funds, President Rodrigo Duterte also said the government will buy the cheapest COVID-19 vaccine that will be available in the market, saying all vaccines have the same effect.

The British drugmaker said it will have as many as 200 million doses by the end of 2020, around four times as many as US competitor Pfizer. Seven hundred million doses could be ready globally as soon as the end of the first quarter of 2021.
""This means we have a vaccine for the world,"" said Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford University vaccine group that developed the drug.
The vaccine on average prevented 70% of COVID-19 cases in late-stage trials in Britain and Brazil but the success rate rose to 90% if the vaccine was administered as a half dose followed by a full dose. The efficacy was 62% if the full dose was given twice, as it was for most study participants.
No serious safety events were confirmed, the company said.

AstraZeneca's shares fell 4%, on track for their worst daily performance in six-months, as investors perceived the efficacy data as disappointing compared with rivals. Pfizer and Moderna , which reported that their vaccines prevented around 95% of cases, had set the bar for success sky-high.
The AstraZeneca shot does, however, have some advantages over offerings from U.S. rivals.
The drug's cost to governments works out at just a few dollars a shot, a fraction of the price of shots from Pfizer and Moderna, which use a more unconventional technology.
It can also be transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, which proponents say would make it easier to distribute, especially in poor countries, than Pfizer's, which needs to be shipped and stored at -70C.
The faster roll-out means both rich and poor countries that had been drawing up plans to ration vaccines can distribute them more widely, helping to eventually halt the social and economic disruption of a pandemic that has killed 1.4 million people.
""The bulk of the vaccine rollout programme will be in January, February, March. And we hope that sometime after Easter things will be able to start to get back to normal,"" said Matt Hancock, health secretary of Britain which has pre-ordered 100 million doses for its 67 million people.
In poor countries, where the logistics of distributing rival vaccines posed a bigger challenge, the effect of a cheaper and easier alternative could be even more pronounced. Zahid Maleque, health minister of Bangladesh, which is buying in 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine made in India, called the findings ""really good news"".
""The big advantage of having the vaccine is that it can be stored, transported and handled at 2-8 degrees Celsius, and we have that storage facility,"" he said.
The World Health Organization's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan called the results ""encouraging"" and said the health body looked forward to seeing the data.
""We welcome the efforts of Oxford/AZ to make the vaccine affordable and easy to store, which will be good for countries and people everywhere.""
""WE'LL BE A LOT HAPPIER""
Nevertheless, there was criticism of AstraZeneca's findings.
Analysts from SVB Leerink, a healthcare-focused investment bank, said AstraZeneca had not yet disclosed enough information about safety events that had forced it to temporarily put a study on hold in the United States.
Leerink noted that only a small number of people had received the smaller first dose. Of 131 cases of COVID-19 in the study, researchers did not say how many had received the smaller initial dose to form the basis for their 90% efficacy finding.
Leerink said it was unlikely the vaccine would be approved for use in the United States, because the data so far did not match requirements set by regulators there. AstraZeneca said it plans to seek approval to modify its U.S. study to get more data on the smaller initial dose.
Some scientists said all three vaccines could prove comparable in the end.
""I think it is a real fool's errand to start trying to pick these three (Pfizer/Moderna/Astra) apart on the basis of snippets of phase 3 data from press releases,"" said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London.
""For the bigger picture, my suspicion is that by the time we are a year down the line, we'll be using all three vaccines with about 90% protection - and we'll be a lot happier.""
Pascal Soriot, Astra's chief executive, said the smaller initial dose was good news, as it meant limited supplies could stretch further to vaccinate more people.
The AstraZeneca vaccine uses a modified version of a chimpanzee cold virus to deliver instructions to cells to fight the target virus, a different approach from Pfizer and Moderna, which rely on new technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA).
AstraZeneca will now prepare regulatory submission of the data to authorities around the world that have a framework for conditional or early approval. It will also seek an emergency use listing from the WHO to speed up availability in poor countries. -- Reuters",GMA News,1.0,0.8780999779701233,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['united_kingdom', 'astrazeneca', 'say', 'monday', 'coronavirus', 'disease', 'much', 'effective', 'give', 'world', 'fight', 'global', 'pandemic', 'new', 'weapon', 'cheaper', 'make', 'easy', 'distribute', 'fast', 'scale', 'rival', 'british', 'drugmaker', 'say', 'many', 'dose', 'end', 'time', 'many', 'competitor', 'pfizer', 'dose', 'ready', 'globally', 'soon', 'end', 'first', 'quarter', 'mean', 'world', 'say', 'pollard', 'director', 'group', 'develop', 'drug', 'average', 'prevent', 'case', 'late_stage', 'trial', 'britain', 'brazil', 'success', 'rate', 'rise', 'administer', 'dose', 'follow', 'full', 'dose', 'efficacy', 'full', 'dose', 'give', 'twice', 'study', 'participant', 'serious', 'safety', 'event', 'confirm', 'company', 'say', 'story', 'talk', 'astrazeneca', 'pfizer', 'sinovac', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'astrazeneca', 'oxford', 'show', 'efficacy', 'astrazeneca', 'start', 'new', 'prevention', 'trial', 'antibody', 'cocktail', 'astrazenecas', 'share', 'fall', 'track', 'bad', 'daily', 'performance', 'six_months', 'investor', 'perceive', 'efficacy', 'datum', 'disappointing', 'compare', 'rival', 'pfizer', 'report', 'vaccine', 'prevent', 'case', 'set', 'bar', 'success', 'sky', 'high', 'astrazeneca', 'shoot', 'however', 'advantage', 'offering', 'rival', 'drug', 'cost', 'government', 'work', 'dollar', 'shoot', 'fraction', 'price', 'shot', 'pfizer', 'moderna', 'use', 'unconventional', 'technology', 'also', 'transport', 'store', 'normal', 'fridge', 'temperature', 'proponent', 'make', 'easy', 'distribute', 'especially', 'poor', 'country', 'pfizer', 'need', 'ship', 'store', 'fast', 'roll', 'mean', 'rich', 'poor', 'country', 'draw', 'plan', 'ration', 'vaccine', 'distribute', 'widely', 'help', 'eventually', 'halt', 'social', 'economic', 'disruption', 'pandemic', 'kill', 'people', 'bulk', 'rollout', 'programme', 'january', 'february', 'march', 'hope', 'sometime', 'easter', 'thing', 'start', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'say', 'health', 'secretary', 'pre', 'order', 'dose', 'people', 'poor', 'country', 'logistics', 'distribute', 'rival', 'vaccine', 'pose', 'big', 'challenge', 'effect', 'cheaper', 'easy', 'alternative', 'even', 'pronounce', 'maleque', 'health', 'minister', 'bangladesh', 'buy', 'dose', 'astrazeneca', 'make', 'india', 'call', 'finding', 'really', 'good', 'big', 'advantage', 'store', 'transport', 'handle', 'storage', 'facility', 'say', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'chief', 'scientist', 'soumya', 'swaminathan', 'call', 'result', 'encourage', 'say', 'health', 'body', 'look', 'forward', 'see', 'datum', 'welcome', 'effort', 'oxford', 'make', 'affordable', 'easy', 'store', 'good', 'country', 'people', 'everywhere', 'well', 'lot', 'happy', 'nevertheless', 'criticism', 'astrazenecas', 'finding', 'analyst', 'svb', 'leerink', 'healthcare', 'focus', 'investment', 'bank', 'say', 'astrazeneca', 'yet', 'disclose', 'enough', 'information', 'safety', 'event', 'force', 'temporarily', 'put', 'study', 'hold', 'leerink', 'note', 'small', 'number', 'people', 'receive', 'small', 'first', 'dose', 'case', 'study', 'researcher', 'many', 'receive', 'small', 'initial', 'dose', 'form', 'basis', 'efficacy', 'finding', 'leerink', 'say', 'unlikely', 'approve', 'use', 'datum', 'far', 'match', 'requirement', 'set', 'regulator', 'astrazeneca', 'say', 'plan', 'seek', 'approval', 'modify', 'study', 'get', 'datum', 'small', 'initial', 'dose', 'scientist', 'say', 'vaccine', 'prove', 'comparable', 'end', 'think', 'real', 'fool', 'errand', 'start', 'try', 'pick', 'pfizer', 'apart', 'basis', 'snippet', 'phase', 'data', 'press', 'release', 'say', 'danny', 'professor', 'immunology', 'imperial', 'college', 'london', 'big', 'picture', 'suspicion', 'time', 'year', 'line', 'well', 'use', 'vaccine', 'protection', 'well', 'lot', 'happy', 'pascal', 'soriot', 'astras', 'chief_executive', 'say', 'small', 'initial', 'dose', 'good', 'mean', 'limited', 'supply', 'stretch', 'vaccinate', 'people', 'astrazeneca', 'use', 'modify', 'version', 'chimpanzee', 'cold', 'virus', 'deliver', 'instruction', 'cell', 'fight', 'target', 'virus', 'different', 'approach', 'pfizer', 'moderna', 'rely', 'new', 'technology', 'know', 'mrna', 'astrazeneca', 'prepare', 'regulatory', 'submission', 'datum', 'authority', 'world', 'framework', 'conditional', 'early', 'approval', 'also', 'seek', 'list', 'speed', 'availability', 'poor', 'country', 'reuters']",0.9837,0.099,0.731,0.169,0.47586755156608096,Positive

""Pag na-approve na 'yan, may vaccine na, ako muna magpa-vaccine para bago ang sambayanang Pilipino, bago ang mahihirap,"" Pacquiao said in an interview on ANC.
He added that he would ""willingly"" do it regardless of which country the vaccine would come from.
The first COVID-19 vaccine that may be available in the country in March 2021 would probably come from China, according to National Task Force Against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr.
The Palace also said President Rodrigo Duterte is willing to get vaccinated once the COVID-19 vaccines secure emergency use authorization from local regulators.

“Teachers are trained to teach, not to administer vaccine,” she added.
In discussions with the Department of Health, the DepEd’s top official said she gave commitment that teachers can assist in educating the public about the COVID-19 vaccine once they become available.
“Ang malaking kontribusyon ng mga teachers ay iyong pagpalaganap ng impormasyon hinggil sa vaccine. But even for that, kailangan silang i-brief nang husto, nang maayos ng malaman nila talaga kung ano benefits o ang protection na maibigay ng vaccine sa mga teachers,” she said.

The proposals have generated fierce debate among scientists. Here is the rationale behind, and criticism of, these alternative strategies:
Why delay the second dose?
In clinical trials, companies tested specific doses of their vaccines at precise time intervals to generate evidence showing how well they work. All COVID-19 vaccines approved, so far, are designed to teach the immune system to recognize and defend against the virus with a first dose, and then provide a second booster dose to reinforce that lesson.
Faced with a fast-spreading pandemic and new, more transmissible coronavirus variants, some countries are hoping to widen immunization by giving some protection to as many people as possible with a first dose, and delaying second doses.

BioNTech warns against delaying second vaccine dose
Maximizing the number of people who have partial immunity ""should reduce the number of severe COVID-19 cases and thus alleviate the burden on hospitals,"" said Michael Head, a global health expert at Britain's University of Southampton.
What about switching between COVID vaccines?
Mixing or switching between COVID-19 vaccines is largely driven by the same aim—vaccinating as many people as possible as the pandemic still rages.
Giving a priming dose of one vaccine and a booster dose of another offers flexibility to offer whichever shots are available, rather than holding shots back so individuals always get both doses of the same vaccine.
Have these strategies been tested in rigorous trials?
No.
None of the late-stage COVID-19 vaccine trials compared these dose-sparing strategies or the effects of mixing vaccine types, said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).
Officials have cited limited evidence from trials that the Pfizer/BioNTech , the Oxford University/AstraZeneca and the Moderna vaccines all confer some protection against COVID-19 after the first dose.
Britain's MHRA health regulator said on Dec. 30 it had found an 80% success rate for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine when two full doses are administered, three months apart, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found.
The UK government's vaccine advisory committee said on Dec. 31 that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine conferred 89% protection from two weeks after the first dose, and that for the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine ""the evidence shows that the initial dose...offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus."" It did not give detailed data.
Moderna reported its vaccine was 80% protective after one dose, with efficacy peaking two weeks after the first shot.
But there is no long-term evidence that any of these vaccines will offer lasting immunity based on just one dose, or how effective they will be if the second dose is delayed.
BioNTech and Pfizer warned on Monday they had no evidence their vaccine would continue to be protective if the second dose was given more than 21 days after the first.
Evans said that ideally ""it is safest and most cautious"" to use vaccines in conditions exactly matching those of their trials, but added: ""In the real world, this is never so.""
Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Friday the United States was unlikely to delay giving second doses.
""We're going to keep doing what we're doing,"" he said.
Likewise, scientists have raised concerns over the idea of mixing two different types of vaccines. Some experts speculate that, because all of the vaccines target the same outer ""spike"" protein of the virus, they could work together to train the body to fight off the virus.
But there is no evidence this approach will work.
""There is literally zero data. It has not been tested, or if it has been tested, the data have not been made available,"" said John Moore, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.
What about reducing the amount of vaccine in each dose?
In the United States, some health officials are considering offering half doses of Moderna's vaccine to individuals aged 18 to 55. There is some clinical trial data backing this strategy.
Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the US vaccine program Operation Warp Speed, told CBS on Sunday that evidence from a Moderna trial showed the half dose induced an ""identical immune response"" to the higher 100 microgram dose in adults aged 55 and under. He said the US government was discussing the issue with Moderna and regulators.
Slaoui said he believed injecting half of the volume of vaccine was ""a more responsible approach that would be based on facts and data.""
Several US scientists agreed, but noted the data was not publicly available. ""It's very fuzzy. I want to see that data,"" said Eric Topol, a genomics expert and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.
So are these strategies safe? And will they work?
It's not clear.
While there is no scientific evidence on the impact of delaying COVID-19 vaccine doses, some experts believe it could be safe to wait and the potential payoff in protecting a larger swath of the population may be worth it.
Others aren't so sure.
""There's just no data,"" said Ian Jones, a professor of virology at Britain's Reading University.
The British Society of Immunology said in a statement on Monday that delaying a second dose by eight weeks ""would be unlikely to have a negative effect on the overall immune response."" It added that it would not expect any extra safety risks from the delay beyond the potential increased risk of disease during the interim between doses.
Some scientists also said that while there was no evidence to support the strategy of mixing vaccine doses from different manufacturers—a method known as heterologous prime-boost—evidence from other vaccines provided some reassurance.
""Based on previous studies which combine different vaccine types, a combination of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines is likely to be safe,"" said Helen Fletcher, a professor of immunology at LSHTM.
Topol called the mix-and-match strategy ""a big mistake"" with ""unpredictable"" results—including the potential for adverse reactions or a significant drop-off in efficacy. ""It makes no sense whatsoever,"" he said.
Some worry about safety issues, particularly with delaying the second dose for several weeks. The gap could allow time for the virus to evolve and develop resistance to the vaccine.
Weak antibody protection could also increase the risk of having an abnormal immune response—such as antibody-dependent enhancement—when people encounter the real virus, Topol said.
How practical is it to prolong dosing time schedules?
Extending the interval poses adherence risks, raising the chance people may forget or fail to return for a second dose.
It also increases the length of time during which they are less than optimally protected, and it could make it harder for health authorities to keep track of who has had which vaccine, when, and how often.
Given these risks, immunology and public health experts say clear communication is imperative to ensure people understand that although dosing schedules may be subject to change, two COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed to give the best protection. — Reuters",GMA News,1.0,0.7416999936103821,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['london', 'chicago',

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/772340/ibp-says-there-is-legal-basis-for-vaccine-transparency-even-under-covid-19-emergency/story/,IBP says there is legal basis for vaccine transparency even under COVID-19 emergency,NICOLE-ANNE C. LAGRIMAS,2021-01-19 11:58:00,"There is ""compelling legal basis"" for government transparency on vaccine procurement even though the country is under a state of public health emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines said Tuesday.
IBP president Domingo Egon Cayosa joined calls for the government to inform Filipinos about the vaccines they intend to purchase, citing provisions of the Constitution and an executive order by President Rodrigo Duterte.
""Transparency is helpful in establishing facts, dispelling doubts and suspicions, countering propaganda, minimizing political posturing, curbing corruption, promoting accountability, nurturing cooperation, and in enhancing trust in our country’s governance,"" Cayosa said in a statement.
He said the policy of public disclosure on transactions involving public interest, coupled with an acknowledgment of the people's right to information, is found in Article II, Section 28, and Article III, Section 7 of the 1987 Constitution.
Cayosa said that the Supreme Court interpreted these provisions as seeking to ""promote transparency in policy-making and in the operations of the government, as well as provide the people sufficient information to exercise effectively other constitutional rights.""

In addition, he said that Duterte signed an executive order on the freedom of information in 2016 which recognizes ""a legal presumption in favor of access to information, public records, and official records.""
""There is compelling legal basis for  transparency, even under the COVID-19 emergency,"" Cayosa said.
""It is good to let the people know more about the COVID-19 vaccines, the decisions to be made for them, and the public funds therefor.  A well-informed citizenry will 'heal as one,' better and faster,"" he added.
Government officials in charge of securing COVID-19 vaccines for the Philippines face mounting demands for transparency amid questions on the price and efficacy of the shots they seek to procure.
Much of the doubt has centered on what critics say is the government's seeming preference for Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac, whose vaccine was reportedly one of the most expensive among other candidate brands.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque claimed that each dose of Sinovac's product would cost just around P650, much lower than the initially reported figure of over P3,600 for two doses.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. said the government is negotiating for the ""best price.""
But authorities have not disclosed the actual price, citing a confidentiality agreement with the manufacturer.

The vaccine, called AZD1222, has been described by the World Health Organization's chief scientist as the leading candidate in a global race to halt a pandemic that has claimed more than 600,000 lives.
More than 150 possible vaccines are in various stages of development with US drugmaker Pfizer and China's CanSino Biologics also reporting positive responses for their candidates on Monday.
The vaccine from AstraZeneca and Britain's University of Oxford did not prompt any serious side effects and elicited antibody and T-cell immune responses, according to trial results published in The Lancet medical journal, with the strongest response seen in people who received two doses.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose government has helped to fund the project, hailed the results as ""very positive news.""

However, the researchers cautioned the project was still at an early stage.
""There is still much work to be done before we can confirm if our vaccine will help manage the COVID-19 pandemic,"" vaccine developer Sarah Gilbert said.
""We still do not know how strong an immune response we need to provoke to effectively protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" she said, adding researchers needed to learn more about COVID-19 and continue late stage trials which have already commenced.
AstraZeneca shares surged 10%, but then gave up most of those gains, to trade 1.2% stronger on the day.
AstraZeneca has signed agreements with governments around the world to supply the vaccine should it prove effective and gain regulatory approval. The company has said it will not seek to profit from the vaccine during the pandemic.
Adrian Hill, the director of Oxford university's Jenner Institute, said early projections that a million doses of the vaccine could be made by September could be an under-estimate, depending on how quickly late-stage trials can be completed.
He added it remained possible that the vaccine could be in use by the end of the year.
Researchers said the vaccine caused minor side effects more frequently than a control group, but some of these could be reduced by taking paracetamol.
AZD1222 was developed by Oxford university and licensed to AstraZeneca, which has put it into large-scale, late-stage trials to test its efficacy. It has also already signed deals to produce and supply over 2 billion doses of the shot.

According to Rida Reyes’ “24 Oras Weekend” report on Sunday, COVID-19 vaccines such as the one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech may have adverse effects on people with severe allergic reactions.
“Kung ang mga allergies naman po ay para lang sa pagkain o kaya allergies sa gamot, kailangan lang ho makahingi ng assessment and certification from their doctor [that] they are very well to receive the vaccine,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said.
The public was also advised against getting the COVID-19 jab and another vaccine for a different illness at the same time.
Philippine Foundation for Vaccination chief Dr. Lulu Bravo said there must be a four-week interval.

According to the survey, 66 percent said they are willing to get the vaccine while 31 percent said they are unwilling.
The probability-based survey was conducted from September 17 to September 20 using mobile phone and computer-assisted telephone interviews of 1,249 adult Filipinos nationwide.  The survey was non-commissioned.
It has a sampling error of ±3% for national percentages, ±6% for Metro Manila, ±5% for Balance Luzon, ±6% for the Visayas, and ±6% for Mindanao.
The area estimates were weighted by the Philippine Statistics Authority medium-population projections for 2020 to obtain the national estimates.

Domingo made the remark in responding to concerns raised by the Bangsamoro Region leaders that the COVID-19 vaccine should have halal certification.
The National Commission on Muslim Filipinos defines ""halal"" in Arabic to mean ""permissible"" and refers to food and non-food products that are lawful for consumption.
Also, based on Shari’ah law, the concept covers other transactions including banking, finance and other activities Islam believers are engaged in.
“We have asked for that information sa ating mga applicant,” Domingo said during the Laging Handa briefing.

“Iyong Pfizer-BioNTech, they are working on Halal certification. Iyong AstraZeneca, meron silang certification na walang animal product o animal source ang kanilang bakuna, but they are still working on their Halal certification,” Domingo added.
So far, the FDA has issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech, and AstraZeneca-Oxford University.
Pfizer-BioNTech showed an efficacy rate of 95% and 92% in its study population and among all races, respectively based on FDA's evaluation.
AstraZeneca, for its part, was found to have a 70% efficacy rate after the first dose—a rating that goes higher depending on the interval of giving the second dose—after FDA scrutiny.
Other COVID-19 vaccine makers with pending EUA application before FDA include Sinovac, Gamaleya, and Bharat BioTech.
Domingo said that only Sinovac has secured Halal certification so far but the FDA is not yet done reviewing the results of its human trials, which the Chinese company only submitted last January 19.

The Federal University of Sao Paulo, which is running the trials, said in a statement that 4,600 of the planned 5,000 volunteers have been vaccinated in Brazil without any of them reporting any serious health issues.
The volunteers have been recruited in Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Salvador in the northeastern state of Bahia where a hospital is conducting the tests.
AstraZeneca paused global trials temporarily last week after an unexplained illness in a participant in Britain.
Brazil has the third worst coronavirus outbreak after the United States and India and has become a sought-out testing ground for COVID-19 vaccines under development in Britain, China and Russia.

“Vaccine recipients under the WHO Solidarity Trial will be recruited from the top 5 - 10 barangays reporting high COVID-19 cases, based on the attack rates per 1000 population per barangay,” de la Peña explained.
Under the resolution, the WHO Solidarity Trial will be the priority assignment of trial zones.
“This notwithstanding, independent trials should nonetheless be considered in such a way that they will not be deprived of trial sites,"" the resolution noted.

DOH spokesperson Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the remark amid persistent questions on the government’s purchase 25 million doses from Chinese firm Sinovac even if its efficacy rate was lower compared to Western counterparts.
“On the question on if we can choose which vaccine to have… it is not an option right now kasi alam naman po natin na limitado po ang ating supplies. Iyong galing sa COVAX, hindi po ito karamihan,” Vergeire said in an interview on ANC.
COVAX is the global collaboration of manufacturers and experts to accelerate the development, production, and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines.
COVAX's vaccine portfolio includes Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.

Hindi magkakaroon ng chance na makapili sila,” Vergeire said.
Aside from limited COVID-19 vaccine supply, Vergeire said that the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines can only be administered in limited areas such as Metro Manila, cities of Cebu and Davao, as well as some parts of Regions 3 (Central Luzon) and 4A (Calabarzon) since these are the only areas equipped with ultra low freezer facilities needed to store Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines.
Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines require -70 to -80 degrees celsius storage.
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said that COVID-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, China’s Sinovac and AstraZeneca are expected to arrive in the country during the first quarter of the year for the vaccination of the health care workers.
Pfizer-BioNTech and AztraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccines have been proven at least 95% and 90% effective after human trials, respectively.
Sinovac, on the other hand, yielded varying efficacy rates after human trials, depending on the location of such clinical trials.
Its efficacy rate reached 50% in Brazil, 65% in Indonesia and 91% in Turkey.
The Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) already granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on Thursday, saying that such vaccine showed 95% efficacy rate in the study population and 92% efficacy rate among all racial groups.
Prior to the Philippine FDA’s stamp of approval on Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, it previously secured EUA in the United Kingdom, United States, Singapore, Canada, among others. -NB, GMA News",GMA News,4.0,0.9962999820709229,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['countrys', 'health', 'worker', 'luxury', 'choose', 'brand', 'inoculation', 'still', 'enough', 'go', 'department', 'health', 'say', 'thursday', 'doh', 'spokesperson', 'rosario_vergeire', 'make', 'remark', 'persistent', 'question', 'government', 'purchase', 'dose', 'chinese', 'firm', 'even', 'efficacy_rate', 'lower', 'compare', 'western', 'counterpart', 'question', 'choose', 'option', 'right', 'kasi', 'alam', 'naman', 'po', 'limitado', 'po', 'ang', 'ate', 'supply', 'iyong', 'galing', 'sa', 'hindi', 'po', 'ito', 'karamihan', 'vergeire', 'say', 'interview', 'anc', 'global', 'collaboration', 'manufacturer', 'expert', 'accelerate', 'development', 'production', 'equitable_access', 'test', 'treatment', 'vaccine', 'covax', 'portfolio', 'include', 'astrazeneca', 'story', 'give', 'vaccine', 'price', 'say', 'palace', 'doh', 'close', 'contact', 'pinoy', 'test', 'positive', 'uk', 'variant', 'coronavirus', 'already', 'isolate', 'test', 'likely', 'impose', 'travel_restriction', 'uae', 'palace', 'iyong', 'commitment', 'ng', 'na', 'initial', 'dose', 'parate', 'sa', 'first', 'quarter', 'comprise', 'entire', 'commitment', 'supply', 'vaccine', 'population', 'kaya', 'iyong', 'ibang', 'brand', 'na', 'nariyan', 'na', 'na', 'willing', 'give', 'iyon', 'ang', 'maibibigay', 'ate', 'health', 'worker', 'hindi', 'magkakaroon', 'ng', 'chance', 'na', 'makapili', 'vergeire', 'say', 'aside', 'limited', 'supply', 'vergeire', 'say', 'vaccine', 'administer', 'limited', 'area', 'metro', 'city', 'cebu', 'well', 'part', 'region', 'calabarzon', 'area', 'equip', 'freezer', 'facility', 'need', 'store', 'vaccine', 'vaccine', 'require', 'storage', 'early', 'say', 'vaccine', 'china', 'sinovac', 'astrazeneca', 'expect', 'arrive', 'country', 'first', 'quarter', 'year', 'vaccination', 'health', 'care', 'worker', 'aztrazeneca', 'vaccine', 'prove', 'least', 'effective', 'human', 'trial', 'respectively', 'sinovac', 'hand', 'yield', 'vary', 'efficacy', 'rate', 'human', 'trial', 'depend', 'location', 'clinical_trial', 'reach', 'brazil', 'indonesia', 'turkey', 'food', 'fda', 'already', 'thursday', 'say', 'show', 'study', 'population', 'racial', 'group', 'prior', 'fda', 'stamp', 'approval', 'pfizer_biontech', 'previously', 'secure', 'singapore', 'among_other', 'nb']",0.6054,0.093,0.794,0.113,0.3351543384152079,Positive

The trials evaluated the efficacy of the two-shot vaccine candidate 14 days after inoculation of participants, including healthcare workers who treat COVID-19 patients.
In Turkey, the vaccine was tested in two stages among health care workers and the general population, and found to have a 91.25% efficacy rate in preventing COVID-19 based on an analysis of 29 cases, the company said.
In early January this year, Brazilian researchers reported interim results from the CoronaVac vaccine trial showing it was 50.4% effective at preventing symptomatic infections.

Interviewed on Unang Hirit, Vergeire said the DOH agrees with the World Health Organization that vaccination of children against COVID-19 requires further research.
“Kasi sa mga bakuna ngayon all over the world, wala pang nakakasubok doon sa mga bata below 16 [years old],” Vergeire said.
“Hihintay muna tayo ng sapat na ebidensya kung saan nasubukan na ang mga bakuna sa mga bata bago po natin mapatupad 'yan dito sa ating bansa.”
WHO representative to the Philippines Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe pointed out on Tuesday that the number of children that contracted COVID-19 is very low.

William Haseltine, a groundbreaking researcher of cancer, HIV/AIDS and human genome projects, said the better approach now is to manage the disease through careful tracing of infections and strict isolation measures whenever it starts spreading.
While a COVID-19 vaccine could be developed, he said, ""I wouldn't count on it.""
Vaccines developed previously for other types of coronavirus had failed to protect mucous membranes in the nose where the virus typically enters the body, he said.
Even without an effective treatment or vaccine, the virus can be controlled by identifying infections, finding people who have been exposed and isolating them, he said. He urged people to wear masks, wash hands, clean surfaces and keep a distance.

China, South Korea and Taiwan have done the best at curbing infections, he said, while the United States, Russia and Brazil have done the worst.
Tests on animals of experimental COVID-19 vaccines had been able to reduce the viral load in organs like lungs although the infections remained, he said.

In a Facebook post, Robredo presented a study by a leading medical journal which showed that 19 countries have  limited their new COVID-19 infections to five or fewer per million population per day.
The Lancet said these 19 countries were Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, China, Myanmar, Malaysia, New Zealand, Uganda, Togo, Pakistan, Latvia, Luxembourg, Uruguay, South Korea, Finland, Cuba, and Rwanda.
“Pinapakita sa table na ‘to na possible naman ma-suppress kahit wala pang vaccine. If 19 countries were able to do it, no reason why we can’t. Kaya natin ‘to,” Robredo said in a Facebook post.
President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday criticized Robredo after she said on several occasions that the government could have done more to prevent the spread of COVID-19. He said that a vaccine was needed to control the virus.

The Lancet said COVID-19 “can and should” be suppressed through non-pharmaceutical interventions such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, banning mass gatherings, and protecting the vulnerable population.
The study also observed “moderate transmission” of COVID-19 in the Philippines with 37.5 new infections and 0.5 new deaths per million per day in August.
“This study was done using August data. Our September numbers are getting better compared to our August numbers,” Robredo said.
“But, perhaps, it would even be better if we set weekly or monthly targets. Para naman ‘yung assessment natin would depend on how near we are to our targets and we make sure that all our efforts are focused on achieving those targets,” she added.
The Vice President earlier said that periodic assessments of the country’s COVID-19 response is better than extending the state of calamity to 2021.
Malacañang later countered that periodic assessments were already being performed regularly.

Variant in Brazil more likely to reinfect survivors
A coronavirus variant circulating in Brazil is likely able to reinfect people who survived infections with earlier versions of the coronavirus, new data suggest.
The variant that emerged in Brazil, called P.1, carries a mutation that is already known to make a variant prevalent in South Africa harder to treat with antibodies and harder to prevent with available vaccines.
New data suggest that in many recovered patients, immunity to earlier versions of the virus will not afford immunity to P.1.

Researchers tested the neutralizing ability of antibodies in plasma samples taken from survivors of COVID-19 caused by earlier versions of the virus.
The plasma ""had 6-fold less neutralizing capacity"" against the P.1 variant than against earlier virus versions, the researchers reported on Monday ahead of peer-review on a preprint server belonging to The Lancet journal.
""Lower neutralization capacity of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and partial immunity against new variants suggests that reinfection could occur in convalescent or even vaccinated individuals,"" the authors said.
In a separate paper posted on Wednesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review, some of the same researchers estimated that among every 100 survivors of COVID-19 due to earlier virus versions, 25-to-60 could become reinfected if exposed to the P.1 variant because their antibodies could not protect them.
As of Thursday, according to the US Centers for Disease Control of Prevention, there have been 13 cases of COVID-19 due to P.1 in the United States.
COVID-19 vaccine antibodies pass into breast milk
COVID-19 antibodies induced by vaccines from Pfizer Inc/BioNTech and Moderna Inc can pass into breast milk, a small study suggests, although it is not clear yet how long the antibodies will be present.
Six breastfeeding mothers who planned to receive both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines provided researchers with milk samples before and after vaccination, with the last sample collected two weeks after the second shot.
None of the women had been infected with the coronavirus.
A week after the first shot, all of the women had COVID-19 antibodies in their breast milk.
Antibody levels fell slightly afterward and then sharply increased after the second shot.
The two vaccines were similarly effective in inducing the antibodies, although antibody levels varied from woman to woman, the research team reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review.

Some of the industries hit hardest by travel curbs, social distancing and lockdowns rebounded on hopes that the world may return to normal, after pharma giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their vaccine candidate was 90 percent effective in preventing Covid-19.
A vaccine is seen as the best hope to break the cycle of deadly virus surges and severe restrictions across much of the world since Covid-19 first emerged in China late last year and unleashed devastation on the global economy.
""Bombed-out sectors such as aviation, travel, leisure, big oil... time-warped back to 2019 with giant rallies,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst from OANDA.
Wall Street and European markets soared after the announcement, and Asian markets continued the rally on Tuesday, with worst-hit sectors such as airlines, travel, entertainment and energy getting a boost.

""We are a significant step closer to providing people around the world with a much-needed breakthrough to help bring an end to this global health crisis,"" Pfizer chairman Albert Bourla said.
Pfizer and BioNTech's candidate is one of more than 40, but no other has yet made similar claims about effectiveness.
The companies said they could pass the final hurdles for a US rollout later this month, and could supply up to 50 million doses globally this year and up to 1.3 billion next year.
The scientific community reacted positively, with top US expert Anthony Fauci describing the results as ""extraordinary"" and World Health Organization boss Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus hailing the news as ""encouraging"".
But others pointed out that data from the ongoing trial was still needed for review, including the ages of the participants.
The Pfizer candidate uses the ""messenger RNA"" method to fight the virus, but a major disadvantage of such vaccines is that they need to be stored in specialist deep freezers as opposed to refrigerator-level temperatures required for some other types of prophylactics.
Experts have raised concerns about the capacity of poorer nations, especially in warm climates, to set up safe supply chains for such a vaccine.
There was some bad news too. Brazil's health regulator announced Monday it had suspended clinical trials of a Chinese-developed vaccine -- one of the most advanced candidates -- after an ""adverse incident"" involving a volunteer recipient.
Its maker Sinovac said it was confident in the safety of the vaccine.
'A very dark winter'
The coronavirus has infected close to 51 million people worldwide, with more than 1.2 million deaths.
The United States remains the hardest-hit nation at more than 10 million cases and nearly 240,000 deaths, and the pandemic was one of the top issues for voters in the presidential election this month.
Joe Biden, who had slammed President Donald Trump's handling of the crisis, spared no time in announcing a Covid-19 taskforce after he was declared the winner of the election.
""We're still facing a very dark winter,"" he said. ""The bottom line: I will spare no effort to turn this pandemic around once we're sworn in.""
Trump had clashed repeatedly with his own government experts, often refusing to back restrictions or even wear a mask in public. After the Pfizer announcement, he claimed -- without evidence -- that the news was delayed until after the election to damage him.
There was a separate breakthrough when the US Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted emergency approval to a synthetic antibody treatment for Covid-19 developed by the pharma company Eli Lilly.
Bamlanivimab, which was shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and emergency room visits, is the first major drug to be approved that was designed specifically for the coronavirus.
'Out of control'
The vaccine news will be of particular relief to people in Europe -- the current focal point of the pandemic and the region subject to the most widespread restrictions.
Italy was edging closer to a full lockdown, with experts warning of pressure on hospitals.
""There is no doubt that the situation is largely out of control,"" said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases department at Milan's Sacco hospital.

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/healthandwellness/750175/why-polio-vaccine-is-important-for-children-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story/,Why polio vaccine is important for children amid COVID-19 pandemic,JANNIELYN ANN BIGTAS,2020-08-06 20:06:00,"Polio vaccine is important for children even as the world addresses an already big health issue which is the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
In an interview with GMA News Online, UNICEF Philippines immunization specialist Dr. Carla Ante-Orozco said the polio virus was “an important issue that must be addressed even amid the COVID-19 pandemic.”
She said even before the COVID-19 pandemic, there’s already a polio outbreak in the country.
After polio reemerged in the Philippines in 2019 with 16 confirmed cases, Ante-Orozco said health experts had been fearing an increase as the response to its outbreak had to be suspended due to COVID-19.
Ante-Orozco said the global pandemic was “overstretching health systems” and the longer it continued “the more that essential health services, including vaccination services are disrupted.”

According to Ante-Orozco, many children are not vaccinated amid the lockdown, adding up to the number who have missed their routine immunization in the past years.
Given this situation, “there has been an accumulation of susceptible children that are at high risk for polio and other vaccine preventable diseases.”
Ante-Orozco stressed that “protecting our children from diseases is everyone’s responsibility, parents, government officials, civil society, corporations, media—all of us have a role in immunization.”
“Immunization is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to protect children’s lives and futures,” she said.
Ante-Orozco said that through vaccines, many were able to survive without seeing their family or friends die or suffer life-long disability from smallpox or polio.
What do parents need to know about poliovirus?
According to Ante-Orozco, polio is an infectious disease initiated by the poliovirus, which causes lifetime paralysis and death.
It is transmitted mainly through fecal routes or much less frequently by contaminated water or food.
“For example, if someone touches human waste contaminated with the virus, and then eats food without washing their hands properly, the virus could enter the body through the mouth,” said Ante-Orozco.
Polio affects mainly children under the age of 5 years old, although Ante-Orozco said it also occasionally infected adults.
She said there’s no known cure for polio and the only way to protect your children from it was through vaccination.
Ante-Orozco said if a population was not sufficiently immunized, the weakened poliovirus would continue to circulate, which is one of the factors that caused its reemergence.
Additionally, she noted that the longer poliovirus was allowed to survive, “the more changes it undergoes.”
“The polio outbreak in the Philippines is confirmed to be from a circulating poliovirus type 1 and type 2,” she said.
She said this was alarming since wild poliovirus type 2 was certified as globally eradicated in 2015.
Ante-Orozco warned that “poorly conducted immunization activities, when too few children have received the required 3 doses of polio vaccine, leave them susceptible to poliovirus, either from vaccine-derived or wild polioviruses.”
She said only “full immunization protects them from both forms of the virus.”
What do parents need to know about the polio vaccine? Is it safe?
According to Ante-Orozco, the oral polio vaccine or OPV is safe and effective even for newborn babies.
“It is the only proven protection against polio,” she said.
Citing the World Health Organization (WHO), Ante-Orozco said more than 18 million people had been protected from polio-caused paralysis in over 50 years of administering the oral polio vaccine.
She said the vaccine was safe and it was “essential to administer multiple doses of oral polio vaccine to children.”
The immunization specialist noted how the vaccine was designed to be administered multiple times to ensure full protection of a child.
“Each additional dose further strengthens a child’s immunity level against polio,” Ante-Orozco added.
Where can parents get their children vaccinated?
Ante-Orozco said caregivers and parents could take their children to be vaccinated in health centers or wait for UNICEF’s Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio vaccination teams to go to their homes.
For parents worried due to COVID-19, Ante-Orozco assured that their health workers were trained on infection prevention and control during polio vaccination campaigns.
She said the workers were equipped with personal protective equipment (PPE) to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
According to UNICEF, the total coverage for all 6 regions in Mindanao for the Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio mass immunization campaign is about 95.7% or 3.3 million children vaccinated.
Meanwhile, in Central Luzon, UNICEF said the total coverage of children vaccinated was 70.34% or 322,393 children.
They have also conducted campaigns in Basilan (67.5%) and Sulu (70.5%), which are their lowest coverages.
According to UNICEF, vaccination campaigns are still ongoing in Region 3 and 4A.
UNICEF noted that childhood immunization coverage had declined in recent years from 87% in 2014 to 68% in 2019.
What else can parents do to protect their children from poliovirus?
While vaccines are the only prevention and protection against poliovirus, Ante-Orozco said they always “remind families to wash their hands regularly with soap and water, use a toilet, consume food that is fully cooked, and drink safe water.”
“If the safety of your water is in doubt, boil it, ensuring it is bubbling vigorously for at least one minute before allowing it to cool,” she addes.
Additionally, Ante-Orozco said “cleaning one’s surroundings and practicing good personal hygiene are added measures that can prevent infection.”
The immunization specialist stressed that “all children, no matter where they live or their circumstances, have the right to survive and to access the best available healthcare—and we each have the responsibility to help them realize these rights.” – RC, GMA News",GMA News,4.0,0.9983000159263611,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['polio',

Interviewed on Dobol B sa News TV, FDA director general Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo noted the review on the vaccine will take two to four weeks to come up with a decision.
“Ang FDA, sinusuri niya lahat ng data. Kailangna maipakita po sa amin 'yung data, findings, tsaka 'yung scientific na mga information about the vaccine to assure na safe siya at tsaka effective siya,” he said.
“Hindi naman po ibig sabihin porke na-approve na, e approve na po sa lahat. Porke approve na siya sa Russia, e automatic approval dito,” he added.
On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia became the first country in the world to approve a COVID-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing, calling it Sputnik V, after the world's first satellite successfully launched into space by Russia in 1957.

Palace: FDA to ensure COVID-19 vaccine is safe before Duterte gets it 
Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte said he had accepted Putin's offer to provide the country with a vaccine against COVID-19 and that he is willing to try it for himself  during clinical trials.
Citing information from a meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO), Domingo said that there were doubts on how Russia jumped to the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Ang huling update natin ay sa Russia mukhang nasa Phase 2 clinical trial pa lamang at patapos pa lamang. Kaya siguro nagulat din ang buong mundo na biglang kine-claim nila na approved na,” he said.
""Hindi natin alam kung ano 'yung approval process na nangyari sa Russia or baka talagang nag-approve na sila after Phase 2 o kung talagang na-complete nila 'yung Phase 3,’ he added.
Domingo said the FDA will get more information about the approval of the Sputnik V vaccine.
However, ""Defeat COVID-19 Ad Hoc Committee"" chairperson and former Health secretary Iloilo 1st District Rep. Janette Loreto-Garin said that Russia only released limited information about the vaccine.
“Mahirap po kasi dahil walang transparency sa kanilang scientific data 'yung Sputnik V,” she said in a separate interview on Dobol B sa News TV.
“Kung titingnan mo very limited kasi 'yung kanilang information na nire-release,” she added.
Garin, who is also a vaccinologist, said Russia claimed to start the Phase 3A of the clinical trial on Wednesday, August 12, and to mass manufacture in September. For Garin, this is impossible.
She noted that Phase 3A clinical trial usually encompasses 10,000 to 30,000 subjects. According to her, 80 to 90 percent of trials usually fail at this stage.
Garin said the mass manufacture of vaccines can start  six to eight months after the completion of Phase 3 clinical trial. In emergency cases like the pandemic, three to four months of process is possible.
Based on the plan of Russia, the entire process is reduced to a month, which, Garin said, never happened before.

""That is an acceptable level pero pag binigyan ka ng second dose, it give you your optimal, 'yung maximum effect ng bakuna makukuha mo,"" she added.
Individuals who already received the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine can still be infected but with less severe symptoms, Vergeire said, citing expert studies.

The experimental vaccine, which has been licensed to AstraZeneca, produced an immune response in early-stage clinical trials, data showed on Monday, preserving hopes it could be in use by the end of the year.
""The end of the year target for getting vaccine rollout, it's a possibility but there's absolutely no certainty about that because we need three things to happen,"" Sarah Gilbert told BBC Radio.
She said it needed to be shown to work in late-stage trials, there needed to be large quantities manufactured and regulators had to agree quickly to license it for emergency use.
""All of these three things have to happen and come together before we can start seeing large numbers of people vaccinated,"" she said.

This was stated in the copy of the law released by the Palace on Monday afternoon but was signed by President Rodrigo Duterte last February 26.
The measure reads, “public officials and employees, contractors, manufacturers, volunteers and representatives of duly authorized private entities who are duly authorized to carry out and are actually carrying out the COVID-19 vaccination program will be immune for suit and liability under Philippine laws with respect to all claims arising out of, related to, or resulting from the administration or use of a COVID-19 vaccine under the COVID-19 vaccination program except arising willful misconduct and gross negligence.”
Likewise, the measure provides for a P500 million indemnity fund for the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) which would enable the state-run health insurance firm to grant financial compensation in case of death, permanent disability, or hospital confinement of an individual who was inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine.
The same measure also mandates the Department of Health to issue a COVID-19 vaccine card, subject to the provisions of the Data Privacy Act.

“To fast track the process, the DOH may delegate the processing and issuance of vaccine cards to LGUs and private entities, subject to the guidelines promulgated by DOH,” the law read.
“The issuance of vaccine card is intended to be digital, but will remain accessible through other means such as printed cards.”

The company's shares, which have more than quadrupled this year on hopes of its vaccine working, surged another 18% to $15.77 early trading.
""We saw antibody responses that do many of the things we would want to see in an eventual vaccine,"" said Dr. David Weiner, director of the vaccine and immunotherapy center at the Wistar Institute, which has collaborated with Inovio. ""We are able to target things that would prevent the virus from having a safe harbor in the body.""
There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, with governments, drugmakers and researchers working on around 100 vaccine programs. Experts predict a safe and effective vaccine could take 12 to 18 months to develop.
Inovio began human testing of its vaccine in April. Many other drugmakers including Moderna Inc, Pfizer Inc , Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi and AstraZeneca Plc are also in various stages of vaccine development.

On Monday, Moderna said its experimental COVID-19 vaccine produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers, according to very early data, putting it at the front in the race.
Inovio said preliminary results from its human trial are expected in June. The 40 healthy participants in the Phase 1 trial are given two shots, four weeks apart, of the vaccine, called INO-4800, and then followed for two weeks.
""We are already seeing safety data and it has been benign,"" Dr. Katherine Broderick, head of research and development at Inovio, told Reuters. ""Some people have slight redness of the arm.""
Both Moderna and Inovio are using newer technology that focuses on specific genes on the outer ""spike"" portion of the virus.
Inovio's vaccine was designed using its DNA medicine platform, while Moderna's vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. Both companies have no approved drug in the market.
Inovio has been severely criticized by Citron Research, with the short seller slapping a target price of $2 on the company's stock.
Once the preliminary data is in, Inovio expects to approach the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization to move into a Phase 2/3 trial, which could happen in July or August.
Inovio said the latest animal study results, published in the journal Nature Communications, validate its DNA medicines platform.
It plans to test the vaccine in larger animals including rabbits and monkeys, and undertake ""challenge"" studies in mice, ferrets and monkeys, Broderick said.
""Challenge"" studies involve intentionally giving the virus to an animal and then seeing if the vaccine prevents infection.
Inovio's vaccine efforts are funded by a global coalition and the company has said it can manufacture 1 million doses by the end of the year for additional trials and emergency use. -- Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.9944000244140625,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['immunotherapy', 'company', 'inovio', 'pharmaceutical', 'say', 'experimental', 'prevent', 'coronavirus', 'infection', 'produce', 'protective', 'antibody', 'response', 'mouse', 'guinea', 'pig', 'companys', 'share', 'quadruple', 'year', 'hope', 'work', 'surge', 'early', 'trading', 'see', 'antibody', 'response', 'many', 'thing', 'want', 'see', 'eventual', 'say', 'dr', 'david', 'weiner', 'director', 'immunotherapy', 'center', 'wistar', 'institute', 'collaborate', 'inovio', 'able', 'target', 'thing', 'prevent', 'virus', 'safe', 'harbor', 'body', 'currently', 'approve', 'treatment', 'vaccine', 'disease', 'cause', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'government', 'drugmaker', 'researcher', 'work', 'program', 'expert', 'predict', 'safe', 'effective', 'take', 'month', 'develop', 'inovio', 'begin', 'human', 'testing', 'many', 'drugmaker', 'include', 'moderna', 'inc', 'pfizer', 'inc', 'sanofi', 'astrazeneca', 'plc', 'also', 'various', 'stage', 'development', 'story', 'hugh', 'jackman', 'robert', 'hand', 'social', 'medium', 'account', 'health', 'expert', 'business', 'model', 'survive', 'post', 'pandemic', 'federal', 'reserve', 'michigan', 'hit', 'flooding', 'pandemic', 'monday', 'moderna', 'say', 'experimental', 'produce', 'protective', 'antibody', 'small', 'group', 'healthy', 'volunteer', 'accord', 'early', 'datum', 'put', 'front', 'race', 'inovio', 'say', 'preliminary', 'result', 'human', 'trial', 'expect', 'june', 'healthy', 'participant', 'phase', 'trial', 'give', 'shot', 'week', 'apart', 'call', 'ino', 'follow', 'week', 'already', 'see', 'safety', 'datum', 'benign', 'dr', 'katherine', 'head', 'research', 'development', 'inovio', 'told_reuter', 'people', 'slight', 'redness', 'arm', 'moderna', 'inovio', 'use', 'new', 'technology', 'focus', 'specific', 'gene', 'outer', 'spike', 'portion', 'virus', 'inovio', 'design', 'use', 'dna', 'medicine', 'platform', 'use', 'messenger_rna', 'mrna', 'technology', 'company', 'approve', 'drug', 'market', 'inovio', 'severely', 'criticize', 'citron', 'research', 'short', 'seller', 'slap', 'target', 'price', 'company', 'stock', 'preliminary', 'datum', 'inovio', 'expect', 'approach', 'food', 'drug_administration', 'authorization', 'move', 'phase', 'trial', 'happen', 'inovio', 'say', 'late', 'animal', 'study', 'result', 'publish', 'journal', 'nature', 'communication', 'validate', 'dna', 'medicine', 'platform', 'plan', 'test', 'large', 'animal', 'include', 'rabbit', 'monkey', 'undertake', 'challenge', 'study', 'mice', 'ferret', 'monkey', 'broderick', 'say', 'challenge', 'study', 'involve', 'intentionally', 'give', 'virus', 'animal', 'seeing', 'prevent', 'infection', 'inovio', 'effort', 'fund', 'global', 'coalition', 'company', 'say', 'manufacture', 'dose', 'end', 'year', 'additional', 'trial', 'reuters']",0.9761,0.019,0.847,0.134,0.3455515748619197,Positive

Setad, a giant state-affiliated conglomerate controlled by Iran's supreme leader, said production of the vaccine developed by one of its companies, Shifa Pharmed, could reach 12 million doses per month, six months after a successful trial ends.
The first volunteers to take the vaccine were officials of the conglomerate and the daughter of its head, in an apparent effort to boost public confidence in the vaccine.
""The message of this act was that we do not see ourselves apart from the people, and we brought our family first to test this vaccine,"" Health Minister Saeed Namaki said, according to state broadcaster IRIB.
Iran has been the worst-hit country in the Middle East by the global COVID-19 pandemic. It complains that its ability to buy vaccines is hampered by US financial sanctions, reimposed after the Trump administration abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement. Food and medicine are exempt from the sanctions, but banks have been discouraged from financing Iranian deals.

Speaking on “The Mangahas Interviews,” IBP President Domingo Cayosa said the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines is “everybody’s concern.”
“Any contract, whether private or government, ay hindi niya puwedeng baguhin o i-violate ang mga nasa batas o nasa Konstitusyon. It is the contract that must adjust to the Constitution and the laws,” he said.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. has repeatedly maintained that he cannot reveal the prices of the COVID-19 vaccines secured so far due to confidentiality disclosure agreements with manufacturers.
The IBP earlier said that there was a “compelling legal basis” for transparency on vaccine procurement.

“Naiintindihan natin si Secretary Galvez. Maaaring totoo na merong non-disclosure [agreement], but kung hihimayin natin ‘yung non-disclosure, it’s more on the negotiation, not the actual price,” Cayosa said.
“Kung pagpipilitan ‘yun, ‘yung confidentiality daw, that provision, in many cases decided by the Supreme Court, ay void ‘yun. Contrary to public policy. So hindi puwedeng magtago sa likod no’n,” he added.
Cayosa also said that the government can disclose the vaccine prices to authorities who are questioning the procurement, such as lawmakers.
President Rodrigo Duterte earlier ordered Galvez to provide Senate President Vicente Sotto III with details of the vaccine deals that the country has entered into after lawmakers grew skeptical at the vaccine czar’s insistence on keeping mum on costs.
Sotto later confirmed that Galvez was bound by confidentiality agreements.
“Malinaw din po ang karapatan ng mamamayang Pilipino na malaman ang katotohanan at mga dokumento at records doon sa mga matters of public interest.

PCHRD executive director Dr. Jaime Montoya made the remark during the House panel deliberations on the proposed budget of the Department of Science and Technology for 2021.
During the hearing, House appropriations panel vice chair Ruffy Biazon asked if the Philippines' participation in clinical trials will allow it to get priority in the distribution of these COVID-19 vaccines once they are proven effective.
Montoya, in response, assured that an effective COVID-19 vaccine will be available to Filipinos, but there is no assurance on when this will be available.
""Basta ang isang vaccine developer ay naggawa ng clinical trial sa isang bansa, they will make that vaccine available. Ang tanong lang is kaagad ba? Alam natin na itong panahon ng COVID-19, lahat ng bansa ay nag-uunahan na makakuha ng bakuna,"" he said.

""Ang kasiguraduhan lang po niyan, sigurado magkakaroon tayo. Depende na sa negosasyon na maaaring gagawin ng ating pamahalaan sa mga vaccine ng developer ng mga bakuna na magiging successful kung paano tayo mauuna sa pila,"" he added.
Back in May, the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) approved the DOST's recommendation that the Philippines participate in the clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines.
The collaborating organizations for the clinical trials include the Adimmune Corporation, Acedemia Sinica, the Chinese Academy of Science - Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, and SinoPharma - Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Beijing Institute.
The Philippines also joined the upcoming Phase 3 clinical trials for Russian COVID-19 vaccine Sputnik V running from October 2020 to March 2021, with Russia expected to shoulder the costs.
But even if the country is a participant of these clinical trials, DOST Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña said it does not mean that the Philippines is committing to purchase vaccines from these developers.
""Kung ang bakuna na ito ay okay, 'yung isang bakuna ay okay din, hindi naman tayo puwedeng patali habang nagki-clinical trials,"" he said.
""Kung bibili tayo sa kanila, obligado sila dahil dito nila ginawa 'yung trials. Pero hindi tayo magco-commit na bibili tayo sa kanila kahit dito ginawa trial. Dahil tayo ay magko-compare pa rin. Dadaan 'yan sa procurement process,"" he added.
Dela Peña said the IATF has already approved the DOST's recommendation to create a sub-technical working group (TWG) for vaccine procurement.
""Doon sa vaccine procurement, DBM (Department of Budget and Management) na ang magche-chair ng sub-TWG at pitong ahensya ang kasali. Pero magsasabi pa rin kung ilan at alin ang bibilhin ay DOH (Department of Health),"" he added. —KG, GMA News",GMA News,2.0,0.5163000226020813,"say, vaccine, health, dose, first, government, trial, country, world, ng","['availability', 'effective', 'depend', 'negotiation', 'government', 'developer', 'even', 'country', 'participant', 'clinical_trial', 'council', 'health', 'research', 'development', 'phcrd', 'say', 'wednesday', 'pchrd', 'executive', 'director', 'montoya', 'make', 'remark', 'house', 'panel', 'deliberation', 'propose', 'budget', 'department', 'science', 'technology', 'hear', 'house', 'appropriation', 'panel', 'vice', 'chair', 'ruffy', 'biazon', 'ask', 'participation', 'clinical_trial', 'allow', 'get', 'priority', 'distribution', 'vaccine', 'prove', 'effective', 'montoya', 'response', 'assure', 'effective', 'available', 'filipino', 'assurance', 'available', 'basta', 'ang', 'isang', 'developer', 'ay', 'ng', 'clinical', 'trial', 'sa', 'isang', 'bansa', 'make', 'available', 'ang', 'tanong', 'lang', 'kaagad', 'alam', 'itong', 'panahon', 'ng', 'nag', 'uunahan', 'na', 'makakuha', 'ng', 'bakuna', 'say', 'story', 'doh', 'low', 'cost', 'sole', 'factor', 'procure', 'doh', 'back', 'ban', 'home', 'quarantine', 'prevent', 'community', 'transmission', 'extreme', 'lockdown', 'impose', 'residential', 'compound', 'muntinlupa', 'ang', 'po', 'tayo', 'depende', 'na', 'negosasyon', 'na', 'maaare', 'gagawin', 'ng', 'ate', 'pamahalaan', 'sa', 'mga', 'ng', 'developer', 'ng', 'mga', 'bakuna', 'na', 'magiging', 'successful', 'kung', 'paano', 'tayo', 'mauuna', 'sa', 'pila', 'add', 'back', 'inter_agency', 'management', 'approve', 'dost', 'recommendation', 'participate', 'clinical_trial', 'vaccine', 'collaborate', 'organization', 'clinical_trial', 'include', 'adimmune', 'corporation', 'acedemia', 'sinica', 'chinese', 'academy', 'science', 'guangzhou', 'institute', 'biomedicine', 'health', 'wuhan', 'institute', 'biological', 'product', 'beijing', 'institute', 'also', 'join', 'upcoming', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'russian', 'sputnik', 'run', 'october', 'march', 'russia', 'expect', 'shoulder', 'cost', 'even', 'country', 'participant', 'clinical_trial', 'dost', 'secretary', 'say', 'mean', 'commit', 'purchase', 'vaccine', 'developer', 'kung', 'bakuna', 'okay', 'yung', 'isang', 'bakuna', 'din', 'tayo', 'puwedeng', 'clinical_trial', 'say', 'kung', 'bibili', 'tayo', 'sa', 'obligado', 'sila', 'dahil', 'dito', 'ginawa', 'yung', 'trial', 'hindi', 'tayo', 'magco', 'commit', 'na', 'bibili', 'tayo', 'sa', 'kahit', 'dito', 'ginawa', 'trial', 'dahil', 'tayo', 'magko', 'compare', 'dadaan', 'yan', 'sa', 'procurement', 'process', 'add', 'say', 'iatf', 'already', 'approve', 'dost', 'recommendation', 'create', 'sub', 'technical', 'working', 'group', 'twg', 'procurement', 'procurement', 'dbm', 'department', 'budget', 'management', 'na', 'chair', 'ng', 'sub', 'pitong', 'kung', 'ilan', 'alin', 'ang', 'bibilhin', 'ay', 'doh', 'department', 'health', 'add', 'kg']",0.926,0.047,0.847,0.106,0.4345588235294118,Positive

PANTI,2021-01-20 14:06:00,"The Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) can store more than one million doses of COVID-19 vaccines requiring ultra low storage, the Department of Health (DOH) said on Wednesday. 
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the announcement a day after Deputy Chief Implementer Vince Dizon of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 said the government is already negotiating with 28 private companies to ensure proper storage of COVID-19 vaccines to preserve their efficacy.
“RITM has five ultra low freezers for COVID-19 vaccines which can accommodate -20 to -80 degrees Celsius storage requirement,” the DOH official said in an online briefing. 
“Each ultra low freezer can store up to 230,200 doses or 46,240 vials,” she added.
In addition, Vergeire earlier said the DOH's 17 regional offices have equipment that can store vaccines requiring the 2 to 8 degrees Celsius storage temperature.

“We have this existing capacity of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius storage which [preservation] can last up to three months,” she said. 
Likewise, Vergeire said DOH has enough portable transport boxes for vaccine deployment because existing national immunization programs are being done house-to-house, especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The DOH official, however, said the Health department does not have refrigerated trucks for vaccine deployment and such service is being contracted whenever the need arises, as in previous national immunization efforts. 
Vergeire earlier said the deployment of vaccines requiring ultra low cold storage of -20 to -80 degrees Celsius such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna will be limited to highly-urbanized areas such as Metro Manila, the cities of Cebu and Davao, and some parts of Central Luzon and Calabarzon since these are the only areas equipped with ultra low storage facilities. 
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. for his part, assured the public that the country will be securing 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from seven vaccine makers so far, namely, Pfizer-BioNTech, Sinovac, AstraZeneca, Novovax, Johnson and Johnson, Gamaleya and Bharat BioTech. 
Only Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration so far. The FDA found it 95% and 92% effective on study population and among all races, respectively—a requirement before a vaccine can be administered in the country.
Galvez said that 70 million Filipinos will get a COVID-19 vaccine within the year in a best case scenario, and that the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination will start by February. —KG, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.5537999868392944,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['ritm', 'store', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'require', 'storage', 'department', 'health', 'doh', 'say', 'wednesday', 'health', 'rosario_vergeire', 'make', 'announcement', 'day', 'deputy', 'vince_dizon', 'force', 'say', 'government', 'already', 'negotiate', 'private', 'company', 'ensure', 'proper', 'storage', 'vaccine', 'preserve', 'efficacy', 'ritm', 'freezer', 'vaccine', 'accommodate', 'storage', 'requirement', 'doh', 'official', 'say', 'online', 'briefing', 'freezer', 'store', 'dose', 'vial', 'add', 'addition', 'vergeire', 'early', 'say', 'regional', 'office', 'equipment', 'store', 'vaccine', 'require', 'storage', 'temperature', 'story', 'robredo', 'get', 'public', 'say', 'spox', 'fund', 'enough', 'vaccine', 'say', 'dizon', 'sotto', 'word', 'yet', 'galvez', 'deal', 'exist', 'capacity', 'storage', 'preservation', 'last', 'month', 'say', 'likewise', 'vergeire', 'say', 'doh', 'enough', 'portable', 'transport', 'box', 'deployment', 'exist', 'national', 'immunization', 'program', 'do', 'house', 'house', 'especially', 'pandemic', 'doh', 'official', 'however', 'say', 'health', 'department', 'refrigerate', 'truck', 'deployment', 'service', 'contract', 'whenever', 'need', 'arise', 'previous', 'national', 'immunization', 'effort', 'vergeire', 'early', 'say', 'deployment', 'vaccine', 'require', 'limit', 'highly', 'urbanized', 'area', 'metro', 'city', 'cebu', 'davao', 'part', 'calabarzon', 'area', 'equip', 'part', 'assure', 'public', 'country', 'secure', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'maker', 'far', 'namely', 'sinovac', 'astrazeneca', 'novovax', 'secure', 'authorization', 'food', 'far', 'find', 'effective', 'study', 'population', 'requirement', 'administer', 'country', 'galvez', 'say', 'filipino', 'get', 'year', 'scenario', 'rollout', 'vaccination', 'start', 'kg']",0.8979,0.0,0.927,0.073,0.46950980392156855,Positive

Tuberculosis vaccine may limit COVID-19 deaths
A tuberculosis vaccine routinely given to children in countries with high rates of that bacterial disease might be helping to reduce deaths from COVID-19, researchers reported on Thursday in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
After accounting for differences in factors that might affect vulnerability to the virus - such as income, education, health services and age distribution - the researchers found that countries with higher rates of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccinations for tuberculosis had lower peak mortality rates from COVID-19.
A good example was Germany, which had different vaccine plans before East Germany and West Germany were unified in 1990, the researchers said. COVID-19 mortality rates among senior citizens are nearly three times higher in western Germany than in eastern Germany, where more older people received the vaccine as infants, they found.

Weekly dorm screenings would not contain COVID-19 outbreaks
Avoiding coronavirus outbreaks in college dormitories would require screening tests for residents at least every three days, according to Yale University researchers. Weekly screening would not be sufficient, they concluded.
Their calculations, based on a computer model of 5,000 students and an 80-day semester, accounted for students' on-campus exposures to the virus as well as imported infections from students traveling, wandering about town to restaurants and bars, or from visitors.
Frequent testing would interrupt transmission of the virus only if infected students are isolated, the researchers said.
""Students must comply with infection control, social distancing, test scheduling and (if testing positive) isolation requirements for the repeat testing system to work effectively,"" the researchers said in a paper posted online on Thursday ahead of peer review.
Also, the tests must be reliable, testing laboratories must guarantee timely results, and efficient communications and supports must be in place so students who test positive can be isolated quickly, they said.
The researchers said universities must be prepared to close their residence halls if repeated testing fails to contain the spread of the pathogen on campus.
Molecular study finds multiple types of COVID-19
There are many ""flavors"" of COVID-19, according to new data that may someday allow coronavirus treatments to be targeted at the specific molecular changes making a person sick.
To learn more about why only some coronavirus patients become severely ill, researchers studied patients' ""blood transcriptome,"" the complete set of genes that are activated in immune cells in the blood.
They found at least five different types of immune response against the coronavirus - not just ""mild"" and ""severe,"" according to a paper posted online ahead of peer review. ""In other words, there are different flavors of the disease,"" just as there are different types of cancer, study co-author Dr. Joachim Schultze of the University of Bonn told Reuters.
Understanding the molecular mechanisms at work in a given patient could help doctors tailor the therapy to target those mechanisms, Schultze said.
The findings also helped his team predict which drugs would likely benefit COVID-19 patients.
One ""prominent"" candidate cited was the steroid dexamethasone, which has already been proven effective in some COVID-19 patients. Another ""surprising"" discovery they cited involved granulocytes, a type of white blood cell.
""Granulocytes, cells that are not really known to be major players in the fight against viruses, play a major role in severe COVID-19 disease,"" Schultze said. The new findings ""will help us to find better therapies and also will guide vaccine development,"" he added.
Months later, recovering patients still have symptoms
More evidence is emerging that severe COVID-19 has lingering after-effects. Nearly 90% of recovering COVID-19 patients discharged from a hospital in Rome were still not back to normal an average of two months after becoming ill, researchers said.
Doctors there studied 143 adults who had been hospitalized on average for two weeks. Most had been diagnosed with pneumonia, and one in five had needed help to breathe.
An average of 60 days after their first coronavirus symptoms, 87.4% still reported at least one symptom - particularly fatigue and shortness of breath - and 55% had three or more, researchers reported on Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
About one in four still had joint pain, and about one in five had chest pain. Roughly 44% said their quality of life was worse now than before they got sick. The researchers did not have information on patients' pre-COVID-19 medical problems and did not compare this relatively small group to patients discharged for other reasons.
But they said their findings suggest more research is needed on the long-lasting effects of coronavirus infection. -- Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.8662999868392944,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also,

PANTI,2021-02-19 09:50:00,"Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said Friday that COVID-19 vaccine makers are pushing for indemnity agreement due to the Dengvaxia experience, citing vaccine czar Carlito Galvez’s earlier claims.
Roque made the remark when reporters pressed him on the arrival date of COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines after the delay.
“Alam niyo po talagang ang sinabi sa atin ng COVAX facility eh darating yung kanilang Pfizer  eh dapat sa gitna ng Pebrero. Pero naantala nga po bakit? Tapatan na po, ang Pfizer ang siya ring gumawa ng Dengvaxia na bakuna na naging dahilan kung bakit nakasuhan hindi lang ang mga opisyales ng gobyerno kundi opisyales ng Pfizer,” Roque said in a PTV 4 interview, referring to the 117,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech under COVAX facility that he said should have arrived middle of February.
Roque mistakenly referred to Dengvaxia maker Sanofi Pasteur and not Pfizer, which he later corrected.
“Kaya humihingi sila ng indemnity agreement dahil ang kanilang bakuna ay covered ng EUA (emergency use authorization), at hindi pa ng general use authorization. Gumalaw naman po ang ating pamahalaan, ang Kongreso ay bumubuo ng isang batas na nagsasabi na gobyerno na ang magbabayad ng danyos para sa lahat ng magkakaroon ng side effects. Na-certify naman ito kahapon as urgent ng ating Presidente, kaya inaasahan n ating magiging batas ito,”  he said.

The Dengvaxia controversy started in November 2017 when Sanofi-Pasteur announced that their vaccine posed a risk to those who were not infected by dengue prior to being injected with the vaccine.
However, the announcement only came after the vaccine had been administered to over 700,000 children and even policemen.
At least 100 vaccinated individuals have died of unconfirmed causes after receiving Dengvaxia doses, and health officials have ruled that that fatalities cannot be directly linked to the vaccine.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Sanofi returned P1.16 billion to the Department of Health for the unused doses of vaccine.
In correcting himself, Roque still insisted that Pfizer is seeking indemnity for its COVID-19 vaccines because of Sanofi-Pasteur’s Dengvaxia experience.
“Lilinawin ko, mukhang mali ang sinabi ko kanina. Ang manufacturer ng dengvaxia ay Sanofi hindi Pfizer. Pero alam nyo po puro Europeans yan naguusap-usap po yan. Kaya nga po parang naging mas maingat ang Pfizer bilang isang kapwa European manufacturer ng Sanofi pagdating sa pagsusuplay ng EUA,” Roque added.
However, Pfizer is an American company, and not European.
Later, Roque said that COVID-19 vaccines, which are approved for emergency use, are not similar to Dengvaxia that had been approved for general use.
“Uulitin ko po ang sinabi ng mga dalubhasa. Sinabi ni dating [Health] Secratary [Esperanza] Cabral, ang Dengvaxia po eh dumaan sa proseso, hindi lang sa Pilipinas kung hindi sa buong mundo at sa WHO (World Health Organization). Ito ay binigyan ng GUA (general use authorization) hindi lang po EUA, at ito po ay desisyon ng WHO at ng lahat ng dalubhasa sa daigdig na ligtas ang Dengvaxia para gamitin sa dengue,” Roque said.
“Pero ang nangyari dito sa Pilipinas, hindi pa naman napapatunayan na ang mga namatay dahil sa Dengvaxia. Nagkaroon lang ng pagkatakot, kaya nga po ngayon umaapela kami: unang una Pilipinas pakinggan po natin ang mga dalubhasa, epidemiologist, specialista, mga vaccinologist at lahat naman sila nagsasabi na bagamat EUA, eh mas marami ‘yung benepisyo na makukuha natin sa mga bakuna laban sa COVID-19 kaysa dun sa kanilang posibleng mga side effects,” Roque added. —GMA News",GMA News,4.0,0.84170001745224,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['say', 'friday', 'maker', 'push', 'indemnity', 'agreement', 'due', 'dengvaxia', 'experience', 'cite', 'galvez', 'early', 'claim', 'roque', 'make', 'remark', 'reporter', 'press', 'arrival', 'date', 'delay', 'alam', 'niyo', 'po', 'talagang', 'ang', 'sinabi', 'sa_atin', 'ng', 'covax_facility', 'darate', 'yung', 'pfizer', 'gitna', 'ng', 'naantala', 'bakit', 'ang', 'pfizer', 'ang', 'siya', 'ring', 'gumawa', 'ng', 'dengvaxia', 'na', 'bakuna', 'na', 'nag', 'dahilan', 'kung', 'bakit', 'hindi', 'lang', 'ang', 'mga', 'opisyale', 'ng', 'gobyerno', 'opisyale', 'ng', 'pfizer', 'roque', 'say', 'interview', 'refer', 'dose', 'covax_facility', 'say', 'arrive', 'middle', 'february', 'roque', 'mistakenly', 'refer', 'dengvaxia', 'maker', 'sanofi', 'later', 'correct', 'kaya', 'humihingi', 'ng', 'indemnity', 'agreement', 'dahil', 'ang', 'bakuna', 'cover', 'ng', 'authorization', 'hindi', 'ng', 'general', 'gumalaw', 'naman', 'po', 'ang', 'ate', 'pamahalaan', 'kongreso', 'ng', 'isang', 'bata', 'na', 'nagsasabi', 'na', 'gobyerno', 'ang', 'magbabayad', 'ng', 'para', 'ng', 'side_effect', 'certify', 'naman', 'ito', 'kahapon', 'urgent', 'ng', 'ate', 'presidente', 'kaya', 'inaasahan', 'ate', 'magiging', 'bata', 'ito', 'say', 'story', 'warn', 'ease', 'community', 'quarantine', 'case', 'new', 'virus', 'strain', 'find', 'japan', 'report', 'palace', 'duterte', 'likely', 'place', 'entire', 'mgcq', 'march', 'dengvaxia', 'controversy', 'start', 'november', 'sanofi', 'pasteur', 'announce', 'pose', 'risk', 'infect', 'dengue', 'prior', 'inject', 'however', 'announcement', 'come', 'administer', 'child', 'even', 'policeman', 'least', 'vaccinate', 'individual', 'die', 'unconfirmed', 'cause', 'receive', 'dengvaxia', 'dose', 'health', 'official', 'rule', 'fatality', 'directly', 'link', 'admit', 'wrongdoing', 'sanofi', 'return', 'department', 'health', 'unused', 'dose', 'correct', 'roque', 'still', 'insist', 'pfizer', 'seek', 'indemnity', 'vaccine', 'sanofi', 'pasteur', 'dengvaxia', 'experience', 'mali', 'ang', 'sinabi', 'ang', 'manufacturer', 'ng', 'dengvaxia', 'sanofi', 'hindi', 'alam', 'nyo', 'po', 'puro', 'european', 'po', 'kaya', 'nga', 'po', 'naging', 'maingat', 'ang', 'pfizer', 'european', 'manufacturer', 'ng', 'sanofi', 'pagdating', 'sa', 'pagsusuplay', 'ng', 'roque', 'add', 'however', 'pfizer', 'american', 'company', 'european', 'later', 'roque', 'say', 'vaccine', 'approve', 'similar', 'dengvaxia', 'approve', 'general', 'use', 'uulitin', 'po', 'ang', 'sinabi', 'ng', 'mga', 'sinabi', 'ni', 'date', 'health', 'secratary', 'cabral', 'dengvaxia', 'sa', 'proseso', 'hindi', 'lang', 'sa', 'pilipinas', 'kung', 'hindi', 'sa', 'buong', 'mundo', 'sa', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'binigyan', 'ng', 'general', 'use_authorization', 'hindi', 'lang', 'po', 'po', 'ay', 'desisyon', 'ng', 'ng', 'daigdig', 'na', 'dengvaxia', 'para', 'gamitin', 'sa', 'dengue', 'roque', 'say', 'pero', 'ang', 'dito', 'sa', 'pilipinas', 'hindi', 'naman', 'napapatunayan', 'na', 'ang', 'mga', 'dahil', 'dengvaxia', 'nagkaroon', 'lang', 'ng', 'kaya', 'nga', 'po', 'ngayon', 'kami', 'pilipinas', 'po', 'ang', 'mga', 'epidemiologist', 'specialista', 'mga', 'vaccinologist', 'lahat', 'naman', 'nagsasabi', 'bagamat', 'marami', 'yung', 'benepisyo', 'na', 'makukuha', 'mga', 'bakuna', 'laban', 'kaysa', 'dun', 'mga', 'side_effect', 'roque', 'add']",-0.9923,0.147,0.821,0.032,0.2927272727272728,Negative

Britain secured 30 million doses of the experimental BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, and a deal in principle for 60 million doses of the Valneva vaccine, with an option of 40 million more doses if it was proven to be safe, effective and suitable, the ministry said.
With no working vaccine against COVID-19 yet developed, Britain now has three different types of vaccine under order and a total of 230 million doses potentially available.
""This new partnership with some of the world's foremost pharmaceutical and vaccine companies will ensure the UK has the best chance possible of securing a vaccine that protects those most at risk,"" business minister Alok Sharma said.
Financial terms were not disclosed.

The deals follow a previously announced agreement with AstraZeneca for the firm to produce 100 million doses of its potential vaccine being developed in partnership with the University of Oxford.
Britain said it was the first such deal which Pfizer and BioNTech had agreed for the supply of their vaccine, which is being tested in early to mid stage trials.
The firms are aiming to make up to 100 million doses by the end of this year and potentially more than 1.2 billion doses by end of 2021, if the vaccine is successful.
It uses the so-called messenger RNA approach, in contrast to the more traditional, inactivated whole virus vaccine being developed by Valneva.
Valneva's potential vaccine is still in pre-clinical trials, and the company is aiming to move into clinical trials by the end of 2020.
Britain also said on Monday it had secured treatments containing COVID-19-neutralising antibodies from AstraZeneca to protect people who can't be vaccinated. — Reuters",GMA News,0.0,0.948199987411499,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['london', 'britain', 'sign', 'deal', 'secure', 'dose', 'possible', 'vaccine', 'alliance', 'pfizer', 'inc', 'biontech', 'french', 'group', 'valneva', 'business', 'ministry', 'say', 'secure', 'dose', 'experimental', 'biontech', 'pfizer', 'deal', 'principle', 'dose', 'valneva', 'option', 'dose', 'prove', 'safe', 'effective', 'suitable', 'ministry', 'say', 'work', 'yet', 'develop', 'britain', 'different', 'type', 'order', 'total', 'dose', 'potentially', 'available', 'new', 'partnership', 'world', 'foremost', 'pharmaceutical_companie', 'ensure', 'uk', 'good', 'chance', 'possible', 'secure', 'protect', 'risk', 'business', 'minister', 'alok', 'say', 'financial', 'term', 'disclose', 'story', 'active', 'case', 'galvez', 'admit', 'gap', 'contact_trace', 'say', 'govt', 'address', 'galvez', 'eye', 'quarantine', 'facility', 'expansion', 'isolation', 'critical', 'care', 'case', 'deal', 'follow', 'previously', 'announce', 'agreement', 'astrazeneca', 'firm', 'produce', 'dose', 'potential', 'develop', 'partnership', 'university', 'oxford', 'say', 'first', 'deal', 'agree', 'supply', 'test', 'early', 'mid', 'stage', 'trial', 'firm', 'aim', 'make', 'dose', 'end', 'year', 'potentially', 'dose', 'end', 'successful', 'use', 'call', 'approach', 'contrast', 'traditional', 'inactivated', 'whole', 'virus', 'develop', 'valneva', 'potential', 'still', 'pre', 'clinical_trial', 'company', 'aim', 'move', 'clinical_trial', 'end', 'also', 'say', 'monday', 'secure', 'treatment', 'contain', 'neutralise', 'antibody', 'astrazeneca', 'protect', 'people', 'nt', 'vaccinate', 'reuters']",0.9876,0.038,0.715,0.246,0.5727272727272729,Positive

Early tests of COVID-19 vaccines yield promising results
Results from trials of two potential COVID-19 vaccines yielded initial signs of efficacy with no serious adverse side effects, according to early data released on Monday.
One was a UK study of the candidate being developed by Oxford University and British drugmaker AstraZeneca.
The other was a Chinese study of a vaccine from CanSino Biologics. Both vaccines use a modified, harmless common cold virus known as an adenovirus to deliver genetic instructions to cells for inducing an immune response against the novel coronavirus.

The genetic components include a copy of a ""spike"" protein found on the surface of the novel coronavirus so that the immune system will recognize and attack the actual virus.
In both trials, according to reports in The Lancet, ""showing"" just the coronavirus spike protein to the body was enough to trigger the immune system to produce antibodies and germ-fighting T cells to battle the coronavirus.
The trials used healthy volunteers who were not directly exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19.
The studies just assessed immune responses to the vaccines, along with safety. Much larger trials will be needed to prove these vaccines to be safe and effective in preventing infection by the virus.
Inhaled interferon may help hospitalized COVID-19 patients
Treatment with an inhaled form of interferon significantly reduced the risk of worsening illness in hospitalized COVID-19 patients and improved their odds of recovery, according to preliminary data from a mid-stage trial released by Synairgen Plc on Monday.
In the trial not yet available for peer review, 101 patients received the experimental treatment, called SG001, or a placebo.
Patients who got SNG001 had a 79% lower risk of developing severe disease requiring ventilation or death.
They were also more than twice as likely to have recovered within 28 days of starting treatment.
Breathing difficulty was also markedly reduced in patients who received SNG001, the company said.
Interferon is a naturally occurring protein that regulates the body's antiviral responses.
""There are reasons to believe it could well be an effective treatment, but these results, while encouraging, should not be taken to mean that the treatment is so dramatic that everyone should be given it,"" said Stephen Evans, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study.  -- Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.9965000152587891,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['follow', 'brief', 'roundup', 'late', 'scientific', 'study', 'effort', 'find', 'treatment', 'vaccine', 'illness', 'cause', 'virus', 'early', 'test', 'vaccine', 'yield', 'promising', 'result', 'result', 'trial', 'potential', 'vaccine', 'yield', 'initial', 'sign', 'efficacy', 'serious_adverse', 'side_effect', 'accord', 'early', 'datum', 'release', 'uk', 'study', 'candidate', 'develop', 'oxford_university', 'british', 'drugmaker', 'astrazeneca', 'chinese', 'study', 'cansino_biologic', 'vaccine', 'use', 'modify', 'harmless', 'common', 'cold', 'virus', 'know', 'adenovirus', 'deliver', 'genetic', 'instruction', 'cell', 'induce', 'novel_coronavirus', 'story', 'doh', 'ask', 'complete', 'report', 'bucor', 'follow', 'death', 'high', 'profile', 'bilibid', 'inmate', 'duterte', 'ask', 'mass', 'testing', 'pinoy', 'possible', 'duque', 'say', 'brazil', 'set', 'test', 'chinese', 'coronavirus', 'genetic', 'component', 'include', 'copy', 'spike_protein', 'find', 'surface', 'immune_system', 'recognize', 'attack', 'actual', 'virus', 'trial', 'accord', 'report', 'lancet', 'show', 'coronavirus', 'spike_protein', 'body', 'enough', 'trigger', 'immune_system', 'produce', 'antibody', 'germ', 'fighting', 'cell', 'battle', 'coronavirus', 'trial', 'use', 'healthy', 'volunteer', 'directly', 'expose', 'virus', 'cause', 'study', 'assess', 'immune_response', 'vaccine', 'safety', 'much', 'large', 'trial', 'need', 'prove', 'vaccine', 'safe', 'effective', 'prevent', 'infection', 'virus', 'inhale', 'interferon', 'help', 'hospitalize', 'patient', 'treatment', 'inhale', 'form', 'interferon', 'significantly', 'reduce', 'risk', 'worsen', 'illness', 'hospitalize', 'patient', 'improve', 'odd', 'recovery', 'accord', 'preliminary', 'datum', 'mid', 'stage', 'trial', 'release', 'synairgen', 'monday', 'trial', 'yet', 'available', 'peer_review', 'patient', 'receive', 'experimental', 'treatment', 'call', 'sg', 'placebo', 'patient', 'get', 'sng', 'low', 'risk', 'develop', 'severe', 'disease', 'require', 'ventilation', 'death', 'also', 'twice', 'likely', 'recover', 'day', 'start', 'treatment', 'breathing', 'difficulty', 'also', 'markedly', 'reduce', 'patient', 'receive', 'sng', 'company', 'say', 'interferon', 'naturally', 'occur', 'protein', 'regulate', 'bodys', 'antiviral', 'response', 'reason', 'believe', 'well', 'effective', 'treatment', 'result', 'encourage', 'take', 'mean', 'treatment', 'dramatic', 'give', 'say', 'stephen', 'london', 'school', 'hygiene', 'involve', 'study', 'reuters']",-0.8176,0.144,0.743,0.113,0.4710119047619048,Negative

""We are ready to share our technologies... If you will establish such basis for production of any vaccine, you can use it in the future,"" she added.

President Rodrigo Duterte has accepted Russian President Vladimir Putin's offer to provide the country with a vaccine against COVID-19, even offering himself as participant during clinical trials.
Malacañang also said the Philippines was ready to work with Russia in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The Philippines stands ready to work with Russia on clinical trials, vaccine supply and production, and other areas deemed practicable by relevant Philippine and Russian agencies to address this global health emergency,” the Palace said through the Office of the Presidential Assistant on Foreign Affairs.
Vladislav Mongush, first secretary at the Russian Embassy in the Philippines, said the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) and the Russian Direct Investment Fund have already started exchanging information regarding the vaccine.
""Let's give your experts some time to review and analyze the documents that Gamaleya Research Institute provided,"" he said.
""So we think that conducting clinical trials is the best way for the Philippine side to prove and to see the effectiveness of the vaccine. We think this is the best way and the safest of course,"" he added.
However, the availability of the vaccine in the Philippines will still depend on how well the Russian and Philippine authorities would cooperate, Mongush said.
""We are ready to move as fast as possible due to the conditions here and due to the speed of work of your Philippine scientists,"" he said.
""I think Philippine authorities should also review the documents for state registration of these vaccines and give approval for the use of that vaccine,"" he added.
PCHRD executive director Dr. Jaime Montoya earlier said around 10,000 Filipinos will join the third and final phase of clinical trials for Sputnik V vaccine.
He added that the vaccine cannot be registered in the Philippines until after the Phase 3 trial is completed. -NB, GMA News",GMA News,1.0,0.9526000022888184,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['russia', 'open', 'produce', 'locally', 'anti', 'official', 'embassy', 'say', 'thursday', 'minister', 'counsellor', 'deputy', 'head', 'mission', 'russian', 'embassy', 'say', 'russia', 'propose', 'option', 'acquire', 'provide', 'participate', 'clinical_trial', 'last', 'put', 'local', 'manufacturer', 'open', 'cooperation', 'production', 'believe', 'quite', 'important', 'share', 'opportunity', 'possibility', 'partner', 'say', 'virtual', 'hearing', 'house', 'committee', 'people', 'participation', 'ready', 'share', 'technology', 'establish', 'basis', 'production', 'use', 'future', 'add', 'story', 'log', 'new', 'case', 'lowest', 'sanchez', 'negative', 'bucor', 'employee', 'infect', 'workplace', 'get', 'add', 'compensation', 'ecc', 'duterte', 'accept', 'russian', 'president', 'vladimir', 'putin', 'offer', 'provide', 'country', 'even', 'offer', 'participant', 'clinical_trial', 'also', 'say', 'ready', 'work', 'russia', 'fighting', 'pandemic', 'stand', 'ready', 'work', 'russia', 'clinical_trial', 'supply', 'production', 'area', 'deem', 'practicable', 'relevant', 'russian', 'agency', 'address', 'global', 'health', 'emergency', 'palace', 'say', 'office', 'presidential', 'assistant', 'vladislav', 'mongush', 'first', 'secretary', 'russian', 'embassy', 'say', 'council', 'health', 'research', 'development', 'pchrd', 'russian', 'direct', 'investment', 'fund', 'already', 'start', 'exchange', 'information', 'regard', 'let', 'give', 'expert', 'time', 'review', 'analyze', 'document', 'institute', 'provide', 'say', 'think', 'conduct', 'clinical_trial', 'good', 'way', 'side', 'prove', 'see', 'effectiveness', 'think', 'good', 'way', 'safe', 'course', 'add', 'however', 'availability', 'still', 'depend', 'russian', 'authority', 'cooperate', 'mongush', 'say', 'ready', 'move', 'fast', 'possible', 'due', 'condition', 'due', 'speed', 'work', 'scientist', 'say', 'think', 'authority', 'also', 'review', 'document', 'state', 'registration', 'vaccine', 'give', 'approval', 'use', 'add', 'pchrd', 'executive', 'director', 'early', 'say', 'filipino', 'join', 'third', 'final', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'sputnik', 'add', 'register', 'phase', 'trial', 'complete', 'nb']",0.9666,0.057,0.778,0.164,0.36557486631016045,Positive

According to a report on “24 Oras News Alert” on Tuesday, the go-signal from the FDA is needed before any clinical trial could proceed.
Science and Technology director Dr. Jaime Montoya clarified that those who will participate in the clinical trial will undergo a detailed selection process.
He said areas with high transmission of COVID-19 will be prioritized. There will also be a zoning wherein each vaccine will be assigned to a certain area.
Once an area is chosen, authorities will then select residents who will undergo the trials.

In an interview with dzMM on Saturday, Dela Rosa said the public should not make an issue on the early COVID-19 inoculation of some PSG members, as it was their personal decision to protect President Rodrigo Duterte from contracting the novel coronavirus.
""Hindi pa nga established kung talagang epektibo ang bakuna na yan dahil hindi pa approved sa FDA pero sila ay nagpabakuna na. Edi nagpapasalamat tayo sa kanila at ginawa nila ang sarili nila na guinea pig diyan sa eksperimento na yan,"" he said.
""Kung maganda ang resulta, edi thank you. Kung pangit, kawawa naman sila at sinugal nila ang buhay nila para sa bakuna na yan,"" he added.
PSG commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III admitted that his unit acquired the COVID-19 vaccine for free, and the President was only made aware that they have been inoculated after it was done.

He nevertheless took full responsibility on the matter, but refused to disclose the source of the vaccine.
Dela Rosa believes, though, that the PSG did not violate any law for receiving a COVID-19 vaccine even as no vaccine has yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
""Nasayo na yan, kung gusto niyo magpabakuna o hindi. Wala namang batas na nagbabawal sa inyo na bawal kayo magpabakuna. So bahala na sila kung ano ang desisyon nila diyan,"" he said.
""When it comes to self-preservation, when your life is a stake, it brings out the best and the worst in us. Kaya kanya-kanyang decision-making na yan,"" he added.
Republic Act 9711 or the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009, nevertheless, explicitly prohibits the ""manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertising"" of any unregistered health product.
In the end, Dela Rosa said he himself would be willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, so long as it is ""with the highest efficacy.""
""Maganda sana kung yung magandang brand, nandito na sa atin at sigurado tayo. Kung available yun, merong Pfizer, kung available na sa public yan, edi pupuntahan natin yung pinakamaganda,"" he said.
""Buhay mo yan e. Bahala na kung magka-utang-utang tayo, hahanap ng pera para makabili lang ng with highest efficacy na vaccine. Doon ako pupunta kung available na,"" he added. #

Speaking to reporters after the Rizal Day ceremony in Manila, Lorenzana said the arrival of the first vaccine against COVID-19 to the country is expected in May of next year ""at the earliest.""
He also said the unregistered vaccine used on Presidential Security Group (PSG) personnel was not enough to cover medical frontliners, who complained about the alleged prioritization of soldiers in the vaccine efforts.
""Ito naman kasing dumating, ilang tao lang sa PSG, wala pang 300 'yan eh, so kung sila ay nagtatampo na 'yung PSG [na-prioritize], 'di naman siguro sapat kahit 500 o 1,000, hindi sapat para mabigyan lahat ng frontliners,"" said Lorenzana, who chairs the National Task Force on COVID-19.

Galvez made the statement at a Senate hearing two days after he signed a term sheet with the Serum Institute of India for some 30 million doses of the vaccine Covovax.
The Covovax vaccine is currently in the third-stage trials carried out in the United Kingdom with 15,000 subjects, as well as in the United States and Mexico with 30,000 subjects. It also underwent trials in Australia, South Africa, and India.
The vaccine is set to arrive in the country by the third quarter of 2021.
Galvez said 30 million doses are already ""locked in"" and may be increased by another 10 million. Another term sheet for some 60 million more doses may be signed this week, he said.

Galvez also said that the Philippines will get 25 million doses of a Chinese vaccine ""on time.""
Amid criticism that the government has taken so long to procure a vaccine, Galvez said that the first delivery of a vaccine to the country is expected on February 20.
This means, he said, that the first COVID-19 vaccination in the Philippines will be in the last week of February.
""The supply and demand is very volatile. The delivery is on general terms, tinatawag na indicative dates. The indicative dates, it might fall early, or delivery will be late by one week or two weeks. Safe to say, we will be having maybe last week of February,"" he said.
The Philippines has allocated P73.2 billion for the procurement of the vaccines for 60 million Filipinos. Galvez, during the day's Senate hearing, said the bulk of the supply will come from US drug maker Novavax.

“To simulate first the COVID rollout, we will be using the measles vaccination using COVID protocols and guidelines that we’re trying to finalize. Using that, we can see also what gaps to address with regards to inoculation proper,” Joseph Juico, co-chair of the city’s Vax to Normal Task Force, told GMA News on Tuesday.
The city is training with the Department of Health for the program. The simulation will cover not just the actual vaccination on site, but also other logistical concerns.
“This is not just for site simulation but also vaccine chain, supply chain simulation, data encoding simulation for those that will be vaccinated. That’s in partnership with a third party private component. And they would also be our partners for the monitoring of patients, adverse events, and so on,” Juico said.
The task force has already identified six of 24 proposed vaccination sites: the Project 6 Tennis Court in District 1; the Batasan Hills National High School and the National Government Center covered court in District 2; the Aguinaldo Elementary School in District 3; the Doña Josefa High School and the Diosdado Macapagal Elementary School in District 4; the Kaligayahan Activity Center and the Fairview covered court in District 5; and the Emilio Jacinto Elementary School and the Culiat High School in District 6.

The city has also identified two possible storage areas for the COVID-19 vaccines: the JC Vaccine Storage along Edsa and the Quezon City Health Department warehouse near the Amoranto Stadium.
When asked about the challenges the local government is facing in the COVID vaccination program, Juico identified manpower as the number one issue.
“Per vaccine site, we need about 22 to 23 people per site. That’s a mix of doctors, nurses, allied personnel. You’re talking about security, you’re talking about marshals. And then you have to populate all of the 24 ideal sites that we would like to put. Second is data gathering talaga. Getting the people to the actual site. That’s another challenge.

Malacañang earlier this month released the list of specific priority groups for vaccination against COVID-19, with frontline healthcare workers at the top of the list, followed by senior citizens, and persons with co-morbidities.

At present only Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca have secured the emergency use authority (EUA) in the Philippines, with supplies expected in the first quarter of the year.
However, President Rodrigo Duterte in December said several Filipinos — including members of the military, particularly the Presidential Security Group — received COVID-19 vaccines from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm even without approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Indemnification
Meanwhile, Drilon said Congress was open to passing a measure that would indemnify COVID-19 vaccines from possible side effects given the immediate need for such medicines.
""Isa sa pinag–uusapan yung tinatawag nating indemnification at payag naman ang Kongreso na sagutin ng pamahalaan ito dahilan sa hinihingi ito ng mga manufacturers na kailangan wala silang liability. Ito ay dahilan sa hindi pa naman fully licensed ito kaso dahil sa pandemic kailangan na. Payag naman po ang Kongreso na magkaroon na sasagutin ang indemnification kung anuman ang danyos o yung mga side effects dahil sa bakuna,"" he said.
Another way was to put a free and harmless clause that would dictate that the national government will hold the manufacturers free and harmless from any claim.
""Ang sinasabi ng manufacturers ay sige idi-distribute namin dahil ito’y kailangan ngunit ayaw naming sagutin yung possible responsibilities from this vaccination. Iyan naman ay payag ang Kongreso diyan kung iyan ang kailangan,"" he said. — DVM/KG, GMA News",GMA News,2.0,0.9966999888420105,"say, vaccine, health, dose, first, government, trial, country, world, ng","['put', 'law', 'guideline', 'prioritization', 'safeguard', 'politic', 'lawmaker', 'say', 'minority', 'leader', 'franklin', 'reiterate', 'prioritization', 'put', 'law', 'ensure', 'guideline', 'strictly', 'follow', 'vulnerable', 'give', 'precedence', 'batas', 'na', 'gagawin', 'ake', 'ilalagay', 'yung', 'guideline', 'prioritization', 'adminsitration', 'ilalagay', 'yung', 'guideline', 'para', 'mabawasan', 'ang', 'opportunity', 'play', 'politic', 'drilon', 'say', 'dzbb', 'wala', 'akong', 'sinasabing', 'ngunit', 'na', 'lagyan', 'ng', 'guideline', 'bigyan', 'ng', 'preference', 'yung', 'frontliner', 'yung', 'mga', 'mahihirap', 'lalo', 'na', 'yung', 'nasa', 'ps', 'yung', 'economic', 'worker', 'yung', 'involve', 'sa', 'ng', 'ekonomiya', 'add', 'early', 'month', 'release', 'list', 'specific', 'priority_group', 'vaccination', 'frontline', 'healthcare_worker', 'top', 'list', 'follow', 'senior_citizen', 'person', 'co', 'morbidity', 'story', 'uk', 'eye', 'next', 'phase', 'rollout', 'get', 'jab', 'pnp', 'report', 'case', 'germany', 'partially', 'close', 'border', 'criticism', 'present', 'astrazeneca', 'secure', 'authority', 'supply', 'expect', 'first', 'quarter', 'year', 'however', 'duterte', 'december', 'say', 'several', 'filipino', 'include', 'member', 'military', 'particularly', 'presidential_security', 'group', 'receive', 'vaccine', 'chinese', 'pharmaceutical', 'company', 'even', 'approval', 'food', 'fda', 'indemnification', 'meanwhile', 'drilon', 'say', 'congress', 'open', 'pass', 'measure', 'indemnify', 'vaccine', 'possible', 'side_effect', 'give', 'immediate', 'need', 'medicine', 'uusapan', 'yung', 'tinatawag', 'nating', 'indemnification', 'payag', 'naman', 'ang', 'kongreso', 'na', 'sagutin', 'ng', 'pamahalaan', 'ito', 'dahilan', 'sa', 'hinihingi', 'ito', 'ng', 'mga', 'manufacturer', 'kailangan', 'wala', 'silang', 'liability', 'dahilan', 'sa', 'hindi', 'naman', 'fully', 'licensed', 'ito', 'dahil', 'sa', 'pandemic', 'kailangan', 'payag', 'naman', 'po', 'ang', 'kongreso', 'na', 'magkaroon', 'na', 'sasagutin', 'ang', 'indemnification', 'kung', 'yung', 'mga', 'side_effect', 'dahil', 'sa', 'say', 'way', 'put', 'free', 'harmless', 'clause', 'dictate', 'national', 'government', 'hold', 'manufacturer', 'free', 'harmless', 'claim', 'ang', 'sinasabi', 'ng', 'manufacturer', 'distribute', 'namin', 'dahil', 'ito', 'kailangan', 'ngunit', 'ayaw', 'name', 'sagutin', 'yung', 'possible', 'vaccination', 'iyan', 'naman', 'payag', 'ang', 'kongreso', 'diyan', 'kung', 'iyan', 'ang', 'kailangan', 'say', 'dvm', 'kg']",0.9468,0.038,0.853,0.109,0.38903508771929823,Positive

In a press release Monday, Mayor Lino Cayetano said the national government's allotment for Taguig City would come first before the procurement of the city government. He said the vaccine from the national government would be allotted for healthcare workers and members of the vulnerable sector.
""The national government’s allotment will come first. We expect it during the first quarter but that will be for medical frontliners and the vulnerable sectors so we have already been preparing our vaccination sites and vaccination protocols,” Cayetano said.
“We want, however, all Taguigeños to have access to the COVID vaccine. All LGU procurement of vaccines, we are told will come after the national government allotment and that will be sometime during the last quarter of 2021,” he added.
The city government allotted a total of P1 billion for its inoculation program. Cayetano said the city has been planning for the vaccination of its residents since September 2020.

""Following the advice of our scientists and experts, we are looking at all available options and continue to be aggressive in our preparation and research into other vaccines and new technologies to help end COVID-19,” Cayetano said.
“We have one of the best public immunization programs in the country and the DOH has cited Taguig in the past years for this,” he added.
He also said Taguig is working on a rollout plan for vaccines that need sub-zero temperatures like Pfizers’ BNT162b2.
“This is why we prepared for several vaccines, we want to be ready to execute based on what it’s immediately available. The goals in vaccination remain to be able to inoculate all Taguigeños safely and immediately,"" Cayetano said.

During the Senate hearing on the government's immunization plan against the novel disease, Galvez explained that the Philippine government will be charged for violation of the confidentiality disclosure agreement if it discloses the costs of the vaccines under negotiation with different manufacturers.
""Once we are proven that we have specifically stated the exact price, the volumes or the contract can be terminated,"" he said.
""So, basically you don't want to divulge the real price, so, you’re lying to the public?"" Poe asked.
""Yes, ma’am. Ang ano po talaga, ma’am... itong tinatawag nating special price is included in the NDA (non-disclosure agreement),"" Galvez said in response.

It was not clear if Galvez's ""Yes, ma'am"" reply was in reference to the first part of Poe's question (""You don't want to divulge the real price"") or the second part (""You're lying to the public?"").
But the senator said she found it disturbing that the vaccine czar openly admitted that he was lying to the public.
Galvez, however, denied that he did.
""I'm not lying to the public considering that I am saying that in order to correct the impression of the public that we are overpricing. We’re just saying the indicative price of not more than P700,"" he said, referring to the cost of the vaccine developed by Chinese firm Sinovac.
""Okay but with all due respect, I thought I asked you that you basically lied to the public and you said yes,"" Poe replied.
Galvez assured the senators that the vaccine price will be disclosed to the public once the supply agreements have been signed.
Senate President Vicente Sotto III adjourned the hearing on Friday and said he expects Galvez to keep the upper chamber posted on the developments in the vaccine procurement.

However, they point out an ethical concern in the process in which the vaccines have been developed by scientists.
""As pastors, we have to call attention to one ethical concern. We have learned that some of the COVID-19 vaccines were manufactured using cells obtained from the remains of an aborted female fetus who was killed in 1973,"" the bishops said in a statement.
""The perennial teaching of the Church must be repeated: Deliberately procuring abortion, even if it is for the purpose of obtaining material for vaccines, is morally unacceptable.

Quoting a statement issued by the Vatican, the bishops said ""when ethically irreproachable COVID-19 vaccines are not available (e.g. in countries where vaccines without ethical problems are not made available to physicians and patients, or where their distribution is more difficult due to special storage and transport conditions, or when various types of vaccines are distributed in the same country but health authorities do not allow citizens to choose the vaccine with which to be inoculated) it is morally acceptable to receive COVID-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process.""
With the scientific breakthrough as vaccines have been tested and currently distributed around the globe, the bishops also commended the scientists.
""We thank our scientists who have once more applied their expertise to the welfare of human beings and to their protection from the dreaded scourge of disease.

Abeyansinghe said that the arrival of the vaccines in the country is a “testament to the strength of collaboration, cooperation, and compassion.”
“It is a testament to the power of working together towards a common goal in the spirit of partnership, equity, and solidarity,” he said.
Meanwhile, the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) said the pandemic has become a child rights crisis that must be ended as fast as possible.
“The longer the pandemic goes on, the more intense the impact on people, especially on children’s health, rights to education, nutrition, protection, and mental health,” UNICEF Philippines Representative Oyunsaikhan Dendevnorov said in a statement.
“COVID-19 vaccination should be part of a larger strategy to strengthen health systems for children and families in the Philippines for the long-term,” she added.
President Rodrigo Duterte personally welcomed the arrival of the vaccines at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on Thursday evening.
Also present in the event was Senator Christopher “Bong” Go, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. and Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles.
Officials earlier said that there was still no date for the rollout of AstraZeneca vaccine pending experts' recommendation on which sector would best benefit from the doses.

The Defense secretary was reported to have received the vaccine on Friday despite Health Secretary Francisco Duque III's advice against it due to his old age.
Lorenzana previously said that Duque told him there were other vaccines appropriate for his age of 72 such as AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

""Unfortunately, as [the virus] spreads it can also mutate,"" he said in an interview.
""Every time it mutates, it's almost like another click of the dial so to speak where we can see another variant, another mutation that can have an impact on its ability to fend off antibodies or to have a different kind of response not only to a therapeutic but also to a vaccine,"" he added.
Last week, Johnson & Johnson said it asked US health regulators to authorize its single-dose COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, and added it will apply to European authorities in the coming weeks.
The drugmaker's application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) followed its Jan. 29 report in which it said the vaccine had a 66% overall efficacy at preventing moderate-to-severe disease.

Gorsky told CNBC the company was ""extremely confident"" that it will meet its target to deliver 100 million doses of its coronavirus vaccine to the United States by the end of June.

The partnership will make the MCF8 — a mobile, hybrid container that allows for the proper freezing, transport, storage, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines — available in the country starting the first quarter of 2021.
""Vaccine manufacturers, governments, hospitals, and local communities are facing significant challenges in transporting, storing, and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine options due to the requirement of maintaining a constant temperature from -20°C down to -80°C in order to retain their effectiveness. Currently, very few options are available to handle the distribution requirements of these vaccines,"" Enrico Klauer, chief executive officer of MECOTEC, said in an emailed statement.
""Through our partnership with DMI, we aim to help equip the Philippines with an effective solution that addresses these concerns as the local distribution of COVID-19 vaccines are on the horizon,"" he added.
According to the firm, the MCF8 has ISO container sizes of 20 to 40 feet that meet current transport standards for truck, railway, ship, and air, which can store up to a million vaccination doses in one 40-foot container and up to 500,000 doses in a 20-foot container.

In a ""Dobol B sa News TV"" interview, Energy Undersecretary Wimpy Fuentebella said the department has three power supply backups to allow for uninterrupted safe storage operations, as well as distribution flow of COVID-19 vaccines.
""Ito ay pareho sa ginawa natin noong SEA Games kung saan meron tayong tatlong backup para masiguro na talagang hindi magkakaroon ng interruption,"" he said.
""Ito [power supply] ay manggagaling sa NGCP (National Grid Corporation of the Philippines) dahil meron tayong ancillary services, ito ay yung sa buong sistema natin,"" he added.
Apart from this, Fuentebella said they also have standby power supply in the facilities of distribution utilities such as the Manila Electric Company and other electric cooperatives.

Likewise, he said, ""All hands should be on deck. Ibig sabihin ay naka-standby ang ating technical personnel na nakatututok kung saan itinalaga ng IATF or ng local government unit yung pagro-rollout ng bakuna."" 
But Fuentebella admitted there may be instances where unscrupulous individuals may cause power interruptions.
What the DOE can do, he said, is to anticipate these instances and pre-position power supply facilities in vulnerable areas.
""Ang ginagawa natin sa Task Force Energy Resiliency at sa Power Bureau, we are anticipating kung ano ang pwedeng mangyaring problema and then we try to come up with strategies tulad ng pre-positioning, paglalagay ng mga gamit doon sa areas na medyo problematic,"" Fuentebella pointed out.
""Maihahalintulad natin sa bagyo. Alam natin kung saan tatama ang bagyo, nakapwesto na yung mga gamit at mga tao sa mga itinalagang pwesto para mabilis tayong makaresponde,"" he added.
British Ambassador Daniel Pruce on Friday said the Philippines will receive nearly 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, mostly of the AstraZeneca brand, stressing that the Philippines was among countries the Global Vaccine Alliance (GAVI) identified as the first recipients of vaccines from the COVAX facility.
The COVAX facility is a global initiative that seeks equal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines for countries across the globe.

Teresita Ang See, a Chinese-Filipino, said the vaccinations started as early as November last year but she had no idea how the Chinese-developed vaccine was brought into the Philippines.
She said most of the Chinese nationals who received the vaccine work for Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs).
“Okay lang sa akin na mabakunahan sila because we don’t have much control [over] them. Wala tayong basis to touch base with them, especially the POGO workers,” Ang See said on Tapatan sa Aristocrat forum.
“I’m glad that they are being vaccinated because it protects us also if they’re protected.”
Ang See said these Chinese nationals had confidence in the vaccine.
Sought for comment, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque and Philippine Ambassador to China Jose “Chito” Sta. Romana said they could not confirm the veracity of Ang See’s statement.
“Wala po akong impormasyon,” Roque said at a press briefing even as he welcomed the vaccinations.
“Kung totoo man eh di mabuti. [We have] 100,000 less possible carriers of COVID-19,” he said.
Sta. Romana, for his part, said: “Unless they came back to China and had the vaccination here in China, as to whether they were brought out of China, I cannot confirm or deny. I certainly don’t know.”
The Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009 prohibits the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, and distribution, among others, of ""any health product that is adulterated, unregistered or misbranded.""
Those convicted of the crime will be sentenced to one to 10 years of imprisonment or a fine of P50,000 to P500,000, according to the law.
Earlier, President Rodrigo Duterte said some Filipino soldiers, who were later identified as members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG), got the vaccine — even though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved any COVID-19 vaccine for use in the Philippines.

The simulation was overseen by members of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, the National Task Force Against COVID-19, as well as the Philippine National Police.
The exercises started at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport where the “vaccines” were unloaded and underwent Customs clearance. The “vaccines” were then transported to the RITM for inspection.
After the inspection at the RITM, the “vaccines” will be transported to healthcare facilities.
The hospitals that will receive the first batch of vaccines are spread out across Metro Manila, Cebu, and Davao.

In one study of 59 healthcare workers who recovered from COVID-19 and received one of the vaccines, antibody levels after the first shot were higher than levels usually seen after two doses in people without a history of COVID-19.
In a separate study, researchers found that 41 COVID-19 survivors developed ""high antibody titers within days of vaccination,"" and those levels were 10 to 20 times higher than in uninfected, unvaccinated volunteers after just one vaccine dose.
""The antibody response to the first vaccine dose in individuals with pre-existing immunity is equal to or even exceeds"" levels found in uninfected individuals after the second vaccine dose, the authors of that paper said.
""Changing the policy to give these individuals only one dose of vaccine would not negatively impact on their antibody titers, spare them from unnecessary pain and free up many urgently needed vaccine doses,"" they said. -- Reuters

LAGRIMAS,2021-01-07 15:20:00,"A near majority of Filipino adults are ""not inclined"" to get the COVID-19 vaccine, with safety concerns being the top reason, the latest Pulse Asia survey results show.
While 95% of Filipinos said they are aware vaccines are being developed, 47% said they would not get vaccinated. Only 32% expressed willingness and the remaining 21% said they were ambivalent, according to Pulse Asia.
Eighty-four percent of those who said they would not get vaccinated cited safety concerns as the reason for their unwillingness.
A smaller percentage, 7%, worried the vaccines might not be free, another 5% believed inoculation is not required to combat the disease, and 4% said the vaccines might be expensive, Pulse Asia reported on Thursday.
In Luzon, 46% said they would not get vaccinated. Fifty-five percent of respondents in Visayas had the same sentiment, as did 46% and 56% of those surveyed from Classes D and E.

Conducted from November 23 to December 2, the survey is based on a sample of 2,400 adults. It has a ± 2% error margin at the 95% confidence level.
British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca and American company Pfizer have both applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) for their COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines.
Two of China’s COVID-19 vaccine makers—Sinopharm and Sinovac—will seek emergency use approval from the FDA this week, according to Manila’s Ambassador to Beijing, Jose Santiago “Chito” Sta. Romana.
Concern about contracting COVID-19
The Pulse Asia survey also showed that 94% of Filipino adults were worried about contracting COVID-19. The figures were ""essentially the same"" across geographic areas and socioeconomic classes.
 
The larger part of those who are worried—74%—reported being ""very much worried,"" while the remaining 20% were ""somewhat worried,"" according to Pulse Asia.
Only 3% said they were not worried and the remaining 3% said they cannot say whether they were worried or not.
To avoid getting infected, 71% of Filipinos said they cleaned their hands regularly and 66% said they use face masks.
Pulse Asia also reported that 32% said they stay at home unless a trip outside is necessary, 30% said they observe social distancing, 20% said they use face shields and avoid crowded places.
The polling firm also recorded smaller percentages of people saying they pray (14%), avoid people who are sick (13%), take vitamins (13%), cover their nose and mouth when sneezing or coughing (9%), avoid domestic travel (7%), consult a doctor or healthcare provider when not feeling well (4%), and avoid international travel (1%).
In addition, Pulse Asia said 58% of Filipino adults lost their job or source of income and 44% said their income decreased as an effect of the pandemic.

PANTI,2021-02-11 13:14:00,"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the compassionate use of the COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinopharm for the benefit of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) members, Malacañang said Thursday.
At a press briefing, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the compassionate use will cover 10,000 doses.
“It (getting Sinopharm) was a decision of PSG,” Roque said.
Roque, however, did not provide further details on how the PSG will procure the vaccines, saying he does not have that information.
Pressed why Sinopharm was the PSG’s choice, Roque pointed to the delayed delivery of COVID-19 vaccines Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca which were scheduled to arrive in the country mid February via the COVAX facility—a global effort which raised resources to fund COVID-19 response initiatives, including COVID-19 vaccines.

“I think the answer is obvious ‘no, wala tayong nakukuhang supply pa sa ngayon ng Pfizer at saka ng AstraZeneca, naantala nga po iyong pagdating na inaasahan natin na mid-February at ngayon inaasahan natin either third or fourth week,” Roque said.
A vaccine needs to secure an emergency use authorization from the FDA for it to be legally administered in the Philippines. Sinopharm has yet to apply for an EUA before the FDA.
The FDA, however, can allow the use of the vaccine without EUA approval provided that the vaccine secured a compassionate use permit.
Some members of PSG, however, have already received COVID-19 shots that were donated to them as early as September or October last year, according to PSG commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III in December.
Durante made the admission after President Rodrigo Duterte claimed during a televised address that some members of the military received shots of COVID-19 vaccine supposedly manufactured by  Sinopharm.
Last January 27, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the probe on PSG members getting inoculated with unregistered COVID-19 vaccine has hit a blank wall after their queries went unanswered by the PSG.
Illegal vaccination probe
In a separate statement sent to GMA News Online on Thursday, Domingo clarified that the issuance of compassionate use for Sinopharm does not absolve the PSG of possible liability over their admission that they vaccinated themselves with an unregistered Sinopharm vaccine in September and October last year.
“[The compassionate use permit is] for future use. The investigation is still being pursued,” Domingo said.
Likewise, Domingo underscored that the FDA’s issuance of permit for compassionate use is not tantamount to FDA’s stamp of approval.
“The PSG applied and complied with all requirements for the CSP. It was granted yesterday and the PSG Hospital takes full responsibility for the vaccines and will report utilization and outcomes to FDA,” Domingo pointed out.
“The CSP (compassionate special permit) is for future use and the permit is for one time importation,” Domingo added.
The PSG, Domingo said, applied for the CSP permit for Sinopharm last January 18.
Ultimately, Roque said that the PSG deserves to get the COVID-19 vaccine immediately because such is necessary to protect the President.
“Kaya nga po compassionate use dahil kinakailangan mabakunahan na iyong ibang miyembro pa ng PSG dahil nga po sa kanilang trabaho na nagbibigay seguridad sa ating Presidente,” Roque said. — KBK/RSJ, GMA News

PANTI,2020-12-31 12:11:00,"Saying 2021 would be a year of ""healing, recovery, and bouncing back,"" Malacañang on Thursday assured the public that the government is on track in its bid to vaccinate the population against COVID-19.
“We are indeed on track and this gives us a sense of optimism,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a New Year message.
For 2021, Roque said the government is hoping “to see an end to the pandemic and continue the pursuit for a stronger and healthier Philippines, which would only be realized if the government and citizens would work together to achieve this goal.”
In expounding on the efforts to secure vaccines, Roque said the government has identified geographical and sectoral priorities for vaccination.
“Negotiations and discussions with vaccine manufacturers are ongoing, and tripartite agreements with the government, the private sector, and allied governments are now rolling,” he added.

Roque said the earliest roll out of a vaccine is expected in the first quarter of next year.
“Together and united, we will heal and recover as one,” Roque added.
Philippine authorities have only been able to secure only one COVID-19 vaccine supply deal -- with AstraZeneca, which is good for 2.6 million doses or good for one  million people.
The AstraZeneca deal, however, was funded by the private sector and will only be donated to the Philippine government.
The government's vaccine efforts however was rocked by controversy recently when it was learned that some military members of the Presidential Security Group have already been administered with an unregistered COVID-19 vaccine.
The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced if not shut down businesses, decimating employment and mass transport, due to the ban on mass gathering and social distancing required to prevent COVID-19 transmission.
PSG Commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III said the vaccine was a donation and given to them for free, but he refused to identify the source. The Food and Drug Administration is already looking into the matter.
This comes amid reports of clandestine vaccination operations against COVID-19 in the National Capital Region, which is now being investigated by the National Bureau of Investigation.
The Philippines has registered 472,532 COVID-19 cases as of December 30, 2020. Of this number, 439,509 recovered while 9,230 died.

The result is based on interim analysis of data from its Phase III clinical trial, but the firm did not give details such as the number of infections in the trial.
President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines said over the weekend that many Filipinos, including some from the military, have already received a COVID-19 vaccine from Sinopharm even as it has yet to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Thousands of variants have been documented as the virus mutates, including the so-called British, South African and Brazilian variants which appear to spread more swiftly than others.
British Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim Zahawi said it was very unlikely that the current vaccines would not work against the new variants.
""Its very unlikely that the current vaccine won't be effective on the variants whether in Kent or other variants especially when it comes to severe illness and hospitalization,"" Zahawi told Sky News.
""All manufacturers, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Oxford-AstraZeneca and others, are looking at how they can improve their vaccine to make sure that we are ready for any variant—there are about 4,000 variants around the world of COVID now.""

While thousands of variants have arisen as the virus mutates on replication, only a very small minority are likely to be important and to change the virus in an appreciable way, according to the British Medical Journal.
The so called British variant, known as VUI-202012/01, has mutations including a change in the spike protein that viruses use to bind to the human ACE2 receptor—meaning that it is probably easier to catch.
""We have the largest genome sequencing industry—we have about 50% of the world's genome sequencing industry—and we are keeping a library of all the variants so that we are ready to respond—whether in the autumn or beyond—to any challenge that the virus may present and produce the next vaccine,"" Zahawi said.
Vaccine race
The novel coronavirus—known as SARS-CoV-2—has killed 2.268 million people worldwide since it emerged in China in late 2019, according to Johns Hopkins University of Medicine.
Israel is currently far ahead of the rest of the world on vaccinations per head of population, followed by the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, Bahrain, the United States and then Spain, Italy and Germany.
Britain on Thursday launched a trial to assess the immune responses generated if doses of the vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca are combined in a two-shot schedule.
The British researchers behind the trial said data on vaccinating people with the two different types of vaccines could help understanding of whether shots can be rolled out with greater flexibility around the world. Initial data on immune responses is expected to be generated around June.
The trial will examine the immune responses of an initial dose of Pfizer vaccine followed by a booster of AstraZeneca's, as well as vice versa, with intervals of four and 12 weeks.
Both the mRNA shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech and the adenovirus viral vector vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are currently being rolled out in Britain, with a 12-week gap between two doses of the same vaccine. — Reuters",GMA News,2.0,0.5250999927520752,"say, vaccine, health, dose, first, government, trial, country, world, ng","['london', 'world', 'face', 'variant', 'virus', 'cause', 'prompt', 'race', 'improve', 'vaccine', 'britain', 'say', 'thursday', 'researcher', 'begin', 'explore', 'mix', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'shot', 'thousand', 'variant', 'document', 'virus', 'mutate', 'include', 'call', 'british', 'south_african', 'brazilian', 'variant', 'appear', 'spread', 'swiftly', 'other', 'british', 'deployment', 'minister', 'say', 'unlikely', 'current', 'vaccine', 'work', 'new', 'variant', 'unlikely', 'current', 'effective', 'variant', 'variant', 'especially', 'come', 'severe', 'illness', 'hospitalization', 'zahawi', 'tell', 'sky', 'manufacturer', 'moderna', 'astrazeneca', 'other', 'look', 'improve', 'ready', 'variant', 'variant', 'world', 'story', 'ex', 'doh', 'chief', 'public', 'do', 'let', 'dengvaxia', 'issue', 'discourage', 'take', 'taguig', 'eye', 'vaccinate', 'non', 'resident', 'case', 'hit', 'new', 'infection', 'thousand', 'variant', 'arise', 'virus', 'mutate', 'replication', 'small', 'minority', 'likely', 'important', 'change', 'virus', 'appreciable', 'way', 'accord', 'british', 'call', 'british', 'variant', 'know', 'vui', 'mutation', 'include', 'change', 'spike_protein', 'virus', 'use', 'bind', 'human', 'ace', 'receptor', 'mean', 'probably', 'easy', 'catch', 'large', 'genome', 'sequencing', 'industry', 'world', 'genome', 'sequencing', 'industry', 'keep', 'library', 'variant', 'ready', 'respond', 'autumn', 'challenge', 'virus', 'present', 'produce', 'next', 'say', 'race', 'know', 'sars_cov', 'kill', 'people', 'worldwide', 'emerge', 'china', 'late', 'accord', 'hopkins', 'university', 'medicine', 'currently', 'far', 'ahead', 'rest', 'world', 'vaccination', 'head', 'population', 'follow', 'united', 'arab', 'emirate', 'united_kingdom', 'bahrain', 'spain', 'italy', 'germany', 'britain', 'thursday', 'launch', 'trial', 'assess', 'generate', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'pfizer', 'astrazeneca', 'combine', 'shot', 'schedule', 'british', 'researcher', 'trial', 'say', 'data', 'vaccinate', 'people', 'different', 'type', 'vaccine', 'help', 'understand', 'shot', 'roll', 'great', 'flexibility', 'world', 'initial', 'datum', 'immune_response', 'expect', 'generate', 'june', 'trial', 'examine', 'initial', 'dose', 'pfizer', 'follow', 'booster', 'astrazenecas', 'well', 'vice', 'versa', 'interval', 'week', 'mrna', 'shoot', 'develop', 'adenovirus', 'viral', 'vector', 'develop', 'oxford_university', 'astrazeneca', 'currently', 'roll', 'week', 'gap', 'dose', 'reuters']",0.9473,0.058,0.808,0.134,0.4154459511077158,Positive

China approved its first COVID-19 vaccine for general public use on Thursday, a shot developed by an affiliate to state-backed Sinopharm, after the developer said the vaccine showed 79.34 percent efficacy based on an interim analysis of late-stage clinical trials.
That rate is lower than the 86 percent rate for the same vaccine reported by the United Arab Emirates on Dec. 9.
Countries have certain differences in their standards and procedures in diagnosing patients, and the final results of COVID-19 case identification were different, Yang Xiaoming, chairman at Sinopharm unit's CNBG, told Global Times, a tabloid published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party.
""Therefore, there were differences between the comprehensive multi-country data we reviewed and the protection rate data previously evaluated by the UAE and Bahrain,"" Global Times quoted Yang as saying in a report published on Thursday.

The vaccine, developed by CNBG's unit Beijing Biological Products Institute, along with another candidate from a Wuhan-based unit of CNBG, are being tested in Phase III clinical trials outside China.

“If this turns out to be a good vaccine, it will be easier for us to make authorization,” Domingo said.
The COVID-19 vaccine developed by Johnson and Johnson earlier secured approval from the Vaccine Experts panel and the Ethics Review Board.

This makes AstraZeneca, a British pharmaceutical firm, the second company to secure an EUA in the Philippines after Pfizer BioNTech.
Domingo said AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, which it developed with Oxford University, has posted an efficacy rate of 70% after first dose.
“All conditions for EUA are present, and the benefit of using the vaccine outweighs potential risk,” Domingo said during the day's Laging Handa briefing.
“The interim data, taken in its entirety, showed an efficacy rate of 70% after the first dose. Tumataas ito pagkatapos bigyan ng second dose, depende rin sa length of time kung kelan ibinigay iyong second dose,” he added.

Domingo also said that AstraZeneca initially showed it is very effective in preventing severe COVID-19 infection.
“Iyong data ng AstraZeneca showed it is very good in preventing severe COVID-19, halos 100% rin. Kaya lang maliit pa ang datos nila, at maa-update pa ‘yan. So iyong 70% [na efficacy after first dose], kahit may nagkasakit [ng COVID-19], hindi grabe,” he added.
Domingo said that the two doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine can be administered four to 12 weeks apart on individuals aged 18 years and above. The vaccine can only be administered by the vaccine providers determined by the Department of Health.
The FDA Chief, however, clarified that close monitoring and surveillance is still needed after immunization.
AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccin has posted an efficacy rate of 90% after human trials ahead of the Philippine FDA evaluation. Human trials abroad showed that it is 70% effective after two standard doses, but it improved to 90% after the first dose was reduced to half.
Domingo, however, said that AstraZeneca’s vaccine’s potential to reach a higher efficacy rate was not dependent on the amount of doses administered.
“Tuloy tuloy pa po ang clinical trials [for AstraZeneca’s vaccine], but currently it does not depend on half dose then standard dose, or standard dose then [another standard dose]. It is more [dependent] on the time difference between first and second doses,” he said.
As for adverse effects of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, Domingo said they were transient and mild to moderate, similar to a regular vaccine.
“Ang pananakit doon sa lugar ng injection, konting sinat, konting sakit na ulo...that can all be easily managed. Walang special na precaution up to date kasi walang specific safety concerns na naidentify,” Domingo said.
The Philippines has already inked a supply deal for 17 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca so far, a number that is good for around 8.5 million individuals since it is administered in two doses. These AstraZeneca doses, however, are expected to arrive only by June this year.
AstraZeneca, which only requires a standard storage temperature of 2°C to 8°C, has already secured an EUA in the United Kingdom whose regulatory authority is considered a Stringent Regulatory Authority (SRA) by the World Health Organization.
An Executive Order issued by President Rodrigo Duterte in November 2020 has allowed the FDA to issue an EUA on COVID-19 vaccines within 21 days since the vaccine-maker submitted its EUA application, provided that such vaccine already secured an EUA from other regulatory bodies classified as SRA by WHO.

A vaccine needs to secure an EUA from the FDA for it to be legally administered in the Philippines.

However, several residents were hesitant about receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
Seventy-year-old tricycle driver Roberto Atchico said government officials such as President Rodrigo Duterte should go first.

“Ano ba ‘yun, hindi maganda ‘yun, ‘di ba? Dapat sila. Sabi nga, ‘Good teacher, good follower.’ Kailangan sila ang mauna, tayo ang susunod,” he added.
Vendor Rose Dalisay also had qualms about COVID-19 vaccines.
“Hindi, kasi po baka hindi match ‘yung katawan ko doon sa bakuna. May posibilidad na baka magkasakit ako,” she said.
“Nakakatakot e, ang daming nagbabakuna, may mga balita na naaano. Natatakot ako lalo na ‘pag sa bata,” a mother added.
Other residents were more inclined to get inoculated.
“Kung totoong effective ang bakuna pang-COVID, puwede,” Edwin Martin said.
“Pwede rin para makagala gala na rin po. ‘Di na rin po kasi kami nakakagala e, tagal na rin e,” Angelo Perez, a teenager, added.

“Araw-araw po kaming nag-e-ensayo o nagsi-simuluate para pagdating ng aktwal na bakuna, hindi na ho mangangapa ang ating mga health workers, ang ating mga vaccinators,” Mayor Francis Zamora said.
San Juan already ordered 100,000 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines and it targets to inoculate 70% of its population.

PANTI,2020-12-29 14:20:00,"Malacañang on Tuesday urged the public not to think ill of the unregistered COVID-19 vaccine given to some members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG), saying it was a donation and hence no public funds were used.
At a news briefing, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque was tight-lipped on the specific details regarding the administration of the vaccine to the soldiers that was first bared by President Rodrigo Duterte.
“Wala pong bayad ang pagturok sa PSG. Huwag nating masamain dahil para ito sa ikabubuti ng kalusugan ng Presidente,” Roque said.
The vaccine was given to PSG personnel despite an existing law that prohibits “manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertising/sponsorship of any health product that is adulterated, unregistered or misbranded.”
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) director general Eric Domingo said they are already looking into the inoculation of PSG personnel reportedly using unregistered vaccine manufactured by Chinese firm Sinopharm.

Roque, however, maintained that such initiative is legal because the vaccine was a donation and not paid for by the government.
Pressed if he maintains such position considering that the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act prohibits public officials from accepting donations, Roque said the vaccine “is not of much value.” 
Philippine authorities have so far only been able to secure one COVID-19 vaccine supply deal with AstraZeneca, which is good for 2.6 million doses or for one  million people. The deal was funded by the private sector and will only be donated to the Philippine government.
The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced if not shut down businesses, decimating employment and mass transport, due to the ban on mass gathering and social distancing required to prevent COVID-19 transmission.
As of December 28, 2020, the Philippines has 470,650 COVID-19 cases. Of this number, 438,780 recovered while 9,124 died.

Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque, Jr. then said that the President will get the COVID-19 vaccine in private like England’s Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh—members of the Royal Family.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said that intensified information drive on benefits of getting a COVID-19 vaccine can increase vaccine confidence from an existing 60% to as much as 85%.
Only Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has secured an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration so far.
In granting EUA, the FDA said that Pfizer-BioNTech has been found 95% and 92% effective on study population and among all races, respectively—a requirement before a vaccine can be administered in the country.
Back in November 2018, vaccine confidence in the country nosedived from 92% to 33% after officials of Sanofi Pasteur—manufacturer of anti-dengue vaccine dengvaxia—announced that their vaccine posed a risk to those who were not infected by dengue prior to being injected with the vaccine.
The announcement, however, only came after the vaccine has already been administered to over 700,000 children and even policemen.
There were at least 100 individuals who died after receiving the dengvaxia vaccine, but health officials have ruled that their deaths cannot be directly linked to the vaccine.

“What’s more important to me is the seal of approval of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). If it’s approved by the FDA, which went through tedious analysis prior to the grant of authorization for emergency use, I’m okay with it,"" Gatchalian said.
""I’m okay with any brand of anti-COVID-19 vaccine. I’m not brand conscious. I put my trust in the FDA,” he added.
A total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, just about a week after the FDA granted it emergency use authorization.
FDA director general Dr. Eric Domingo said Sinovac’s efficacy ranged from 65.3% to 91.2% but only reached 50.4% among health workers with COVID-19 exposure.
This makes it not recommended for health workers, he added.
“This should be administered by vaccination providers and to prevent COVID-19 in clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old,” Domingo had said.
However, Domingo clarified on Tuesday that health workers can still choose to get vaccinated with Sinovac since they merely made a recommendation on which groups it is not suited for.
Prior to the vaccination drive on Monday, a nationwide survey conducted by OCTA Research group showed that only 19% of adult Filipinos want to get a COVID-19 vaccine while 46% said they do not want to be vaccinated against the illness.
But Gatchalian believes this could change as more and more Filipinos will likely to receive Sinovac COVID-19 shots in the coming days.

Interviewed on Super Radyo dzBB, Domingo said the regulatory enforcement unit has yet to submit a report but pointed out they are looking into more details about the vaccination.
“Gusto ko po talaga malaman 'yung detalye kung paano po ang nangyari,” said Domingo, also undersecretary of the Department of Health.
“Saan ba nanggaling ang bakuna? Kung ano ba 'yung assurance natin na totoong bakuna 'yun at na-handle siya properly bago itinurok sa mga, allegedly, sundalo,” he added
Domingo said they will also ask the Philippine Army and Presidential Security Group (PSG) information on the personnel who received the unregistered vaccine.

“Dahil ang Army po ang mismong nagsabi, na ito pong head ng Philippine Army is mukhang nagsabi na merong nabakunahan so at least siya po maaari naming hingan ng impormasyon tsaka sa PSG,” he said.
Asked about Cabinet members who allegedly received the vaccine as claimed by Interior Secretary Eduardo Año, Domingo said he is not privy about it.
Domingo said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III also does not know who among the Cabinet officials have received the vaccine, and that he is not one of them.
On Saturday, President Rodrigo Duterte said some military personnel have already received a COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese manufacturer Sinopharm, which has no approval yet from the FDA.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines, after an internal inquiry, said those who received the vaccine were members of the Presidential Security Group.
Domingo said Sinopharm has yet to contact the FDA regarding possible application.
“Ang Sinopharm po kasi hindi pa lumalapit sa FDA. Wala pa po silang application na kahit ano dito sa Pilipinas tapos wala po silang representative dito sa Pilipinas,” he said.
Domingo added that the FDA will try to communicate with the Chinese manufacturer through the Chinese Embassy.
Domingo also said he finds it shocking than an unregulated vaccine has been reportedly used on military personnel and Cabinet members.
“Ito naman po ay ginagawa kasi natin to assure 'yung safety and quality po ng bakuna na gagamitin o ng gamot,” he said.
“Kaya nga po nakakagulat naman na may nangyaring ganoon na hindi man lang natin po nalaman sana man lang nasigurado po natin na na-handle properly and that it goes through a proper mean,” he added.
Domingo said the process of acquiring the vaccine could have been made legal only if the manufacturer applied for a “compassionate special permit,” which is issued to medicines for emergency and research purposes. The same permit was given to potential COVID-19 medicine Remdesivir for a clinical trial in the Philippines.
Philippine laws prohibit the manufacturing, importation, exportation, sale, distribution, and non-consumer use of unregistered products, according to FDA.

Researchers are racing to establish whether the vaccines currently being rolled out across the globe are effective against the so-called 501Y.V2 variant, identified by South African genomics experts late last year in Nelson Mandela Bay.
""This lineage exhibits complete escape from three classes of therapeutically relevant monoclonal antibodies,"" the team of scientists from three South African universities working with the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) wrote in a paper in bioRxiv, a website that publishes scientific research prior to its being peer-reviewed and submitted to journals.
""Furthermore, 501Y.V2 shows substantial or complete escape from neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma,"" they wrote, adding that their conclusions ""highlight the prospect of reinfection ... and may foreshadow reduced efficacy of current spike-based vaccines.""
The 501Y.V2 variant is 50% more infectious than previous ones, South African researchers said this week. It has already spread to at least 20 countries since being reported to the World Health Organization in late December.

It is one of several new variants discovered in recent months, including others first found in England and Brazil.
The variant is the main driver of South Africa's second wave of COVID-19 infections, which hit a new daily peak above 21,000 cases earlier this month, far above the first wave, before falling to about 12,000 a day.
Convalescent blood plasma from previous patients has not been shown to be effective when administered to severely ill patients requiring intensive care for COVID-19, but it is approved in several countries as an emergency measure.
British scientists and politicians have expressed concern that vaccines currently being deployed or in development could be less effective against the variant.
The paper said it remained to be seen how effective current vaccines were against 501Y.V2, which would only be determined by large-scale clinical trials. But results showed the need for new vaccines to be designed to tackle the evolving threat, it said. -- Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.9961000084877014,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['johannesburg', 'new', 'variant', 'identify', 'evade', 'antibody', 'attack', 'treatment', 'use', 'blood', 'plasma', 'previously', 'recover', 'patient', 'reduce', 'efficacy', 'current', 'line', 'vaccine', 'scientist', 'say', 'wednesday', 'researcher', 'race', 'establish', 'vaccine', 'currently', 'roll', 'globe', 'effective', 'call', 'variant', 'identify', 'south_african', 'genomics', 'expert', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'nelson', 'mandela', 'bay', 'lineage', 'exhibit', 'complete', 'escape', 'class', 'therapeutically', 'relevant', 'monoclonal', 'antibody', 'team', 'scientist', 'south_african', 'university', 'work', 'national', 'institute', 'communicable', 'disease', 'nicd', 'write', 'paper', 'biorxiv', 'website', 'publish', 'scientific', 'research', 'prior', 'peer', 'review', 'submit', 'journal', 'furthermore', 'show', 'substantial', 'complete', 'escape', 'convalescent', 'plasma', 'write', 'add', 'conclusion', 'highlight', 'prospect', 'reinfection', 'foreshadow', 'reduce', 'efficacy', 'current', 'spike', 'base', 'vaccine', 'variant', 'infectious', 'previous', 'one', 'south_african', 'researcher', 'say', 'week', 'already', 'spread', 'least', 'country', 'report', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'late', 'story', 'germany', 'record', 'first', 'case', 'brazilian', 'coronavirus', 'strain', 'detect', 'uk', 'variant', 'case', 'tuguegarao', 'city', 'mayor', 'test', 'positive', 'several', 'new', 'variant', 'discover', 'recent', 'month', 'include', 'other', 'first', 'find', 'england', 'variant', 'main', 'driver', 'south', 'africas', 'second', 'wave', 'infection', 'hit', 'new', 'daily', 'peak', 'case', 'early', 'month', 'far', 'first', 'wave', 'fall', 'day', 'convalescent', 'blood', 'plasma', 'previous', 'patient', 'show', 'effective', 'administer', 'severely', 'ill', 'patient', 'require', 'intensive', 'care', 'approve', 'several', 'country', 'emergency', 'measure', 'british', 'scientist', 'politician', 'express', 'concern', 'vaccine', 'currently', 'deploy', 'development', 'less', 'effective', 'variant', 'paper', 'say', 'remain', 'see', 'effective', 'current', 'vaccine', 'determine', 'clinical_trial', 'result', 'show', 'need', 'new', 'vaccine', 'design', 'tackle', 'evolve', 'threat', 'say', 'reuters']",0.8979,0.068,0.81,0.122,0.4086659275683667,Positive

Evaluation begins right away
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will immediately begin evaluating the results of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine clinical trials conducted by Pfizer/BioNTech.
They will concentrate on the safety of the vaccine and its effectiveness, which has been billed at 95 percent by Pfizer/BioNTech.
FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn said the approval process will include a public meeting of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee, which includes experts in infectious diseases, pediatrics, biostatistics and industry representatives.

Wall Street dips on concerns over fading stimulus, virus fears
The committee's recommendations are not binding, however, and a final decision on whether or not to authorize the vaccine will be up to the scientists at the FDA.
Green light: December
The FDA could provide emergency authorization as soon as the first two weeks of December, according to Moncef Slaoui, the chief scientist for ""Operation Warp Speed,"" the US government initiative to develop a Covid-19 vaccine.
It would be a conditional approval in the context of the global health crisis and would restrict distribution of the vaccine to certain members of the population.
Children, for example, would not be included because Pfizer has not yet conducted widespread testing of the vaccine among those under the age of 18.
Another US government agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), would determine the order of priority for distribution of the vaccine.
Front-line medical workers and elderly residents of nursing homes would probably be among the first to be inoculated.
In Europe, Britain, Canada, Japan and Australia, the process is slightly different and regulators there have been constantly reviewing the data from clinical trials being conducted by several manufacturers.
The European Union could give a green light to a vaccine as early as the second half of December, according to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.
Distribution: late December
Pfizer/BioNTech said doses of the vaccine would be ready for distribution ""within hours"" after US authorization, which could mean shipments beginning in the second half of December.
They would initially be provided by a US factory in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and a Belgian plant in Puurs.
The vaccine must be stored at -70 degrees Celsius (-94 degrees Fahrenheit), temperatures much colder than those of a standard freezer.
Pfizer would distribute the doses to vaccination centers in containers filled with dry ice which should keep the vaccine at the required temperature for 15 days.
Next vaccines: early 2021
The Moderna Covid-19 vaccine could be ready for distribution soon after that of Pfizer/BioNTech and could be followed by February by that of Johnson & Johnson, according to Slaoui, with AstraZeneca/Oxford also expected in the next few months.
While high-risk groups will be the first vaccinated, the US government hopes that there will be enough vaccines by April 2021 to offer it to the broader population and provide high coverage by the summer.  -- Agence France-Presse",GMA News,1.0,0.4318000078201294,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['washington', 'pharmaceutical', 'giant', 'pfizer', 'biontech', 'apply', 'authorization', 'united_state', 'coronavirus', 'biotech', 'company', 'moderna', 'expect', 'soon', 'next', 'step', 'approval', 'distribution', 'process', 'evaluation', 'begin', 'right', 'away', 'food', 'fda', 'immediately', 'begin', 'evaluate', 'result', 'coronavirus', 'disease', 'clinical_trial', 'conduct', 'concentrate', 'safety', 'effectiveness', 'bill', 'percent', 'fda', 'commissioner', 'say', 'approval', 'process', 'include', 'public', 'meeting', 'advisory', 'committee', 'include', 'expert', 'pediatric', 'biostatistic', 'industry', 'representative', 'story', 'childhood', 'help', 'prevent', 'severe', 'cigarette', 'smoke', 'increase', 'cell', 'vulnerability', 'raptor', 'start', 'season', 'tampa', 'spike', 'number', 'dip', 'concern', 'fade', 'stimulus', 'virus', 'fear', 'committee', 'recommendation', 'bind', 'however', 'final', 'decision', 'authorize', 'scientist', 'fda', 'december', 'provide', 'emergency', 'authorization', 'soon', 'first', 'week', 'december', 'accord', 'slaoui', 'chief', 'scientist', 'speed', 'government', 'initiative', 'develop', 'conditional', 'approval', 'context', 'global', 'health', 'crisis', 'restrict', 'distribution', 'certain', 'member', 'population', 'child', 'example', 'include', 'pfizer', 'yet', 'conduct', 'widespread', 'testing', 'age', 'government', 'agency', 'center', 'disease', 'control', 'prevention', 'cdc', 'determine', 'order', 'priority', 'distribution', 'front', 'line', 'medical', 'worker', 'elderly', 'resident', 'nursing', 'home', 'probably', 'first', 'inoculate', 'japan', 'australia', 'process', 'slightly', 'different', 'regulator', 'constantly', 'review', 'datum', 'clinical_trial', 'conduct', 'several', 'manufacturer', 'european_union', 'give', 'early', 'second', 'half', 'december', 'accord', 'european', 'commission', 'president', 'ursula', 'der', 'distribution', 'late', 'say', 'dose', 'ready', 'distribution', 'hour', 'authorization', 'mean', 'shipment', 'begin', 'second', 'half', 'december', 'initially', 'provide', 'factory', 'kalamazoo', 'michigan', 'belgian', 'plant', 'puur', 'store', 'temperature', 'much', 'cold', 'standard', 'freezer', 'pfizer', 'distribute', 'dose', 'vaccination', 'center', 'container', 'fill', 'dry', 'ice', 'keep', 'require', 'temperature', 'day', 'next', 'vaccine', 'early', 'ready', 'distribution', 'soon', 'follow', 'accord', 'slaoui', 'astrazeneca', 'also', 'expect', 'next', 'month', 'group', 'first', 'vaccinate', 'government', 'hope', 'enough', 'vaccine', 'offer', 'broad', 'population', 'provide', 'high', 'coverage', 'summer', 'agence_france', 'presse']",0.8591,0.064,0.826,0.11,0.3189021164021164,Positive

“May 1,246 na nag-consent, at tumataas pa rin ‘yan. The other day, it was only 700 of us,” Aquino said during the Laging Handa briefing.
Aquino said that the COVID-19 vaccination of the hospital’s health workers will take six to seven days, and that there will be two hospitals on standby which can use the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines in the event VSMC won’t be able to use them all.
Aquino said he will get vaccinated with Sinovac himself.

In December 2020, PSG commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III admitted that PSG received COVID-19 vaccines as early as September, when no COVID-19 vaccine products have received an emergency use authorization yet.
The inoculation of some PSG personnel came to light after President Rodrigo Duterte bared that some members of the military had already received a COVID-19 vaccine from Sinopharm.
Durante said that his unit acquired the COVID-19 vaccine for free, but refused to disclose its source.
According to him, the military personnel injected the unauthorized vaccines to themselves and nobody outside the military was involved in the vaccination.
Durante defended the inoculation, saying that Duterte’s close-in-security detail “needs to ensure that they are not themselves a threat to the President's health and safety.”
Sinopharm has denied it supplied the vaccine used on the PSG personnel, according to its sole distributor in the Philippines. —LBG, GMA News",GMA News,1.0,0.9947999715805054,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['look', 'allegation', 'special', 'envoy', 'china', 'mon_tulfo', 'soldier', 'people', 'receive', 'unregistered', 'vaccine', 'last', 'year', 'press_briefe', 'thursday', 'say', 'receive', 'information', 'soldier', 'personnel', 'presidential_security', 'group', 'vaccinate', 'unauthorized', 'vaccine', 'narinig', 'pa', 'lang', 'natin', 'yang', 'balita', 'na', 'allow', 'look', 'magbibigay', 'tayo', 'ng', 'additional', 'information', 'sa', 'nakatataas', 'arevalo', 'say', 'aalamin', 'natin', 'kung', 'reason', 'para', 'mag', 'conduct', 'tayo', 'ng', 'investigation', 'add', 'column', 'time', 'saturday', 'interview', 'tuesday', 'tulfo', 'admit', 'cabinet', 'level', 'official', 'military', 'police', 'senator', 'get', 'inoculate', 'smuggle', 'sinopharm', 'vaccine', 'october', 'last', 'year', 'story', 'duterte', 'likely', 'sign', 'bill', 'end', 'week', 'say', 'roque', 'indonesia', 'secure', 'sinopharm', 'private', 'use', 'palace', 'study', 'duterte', 'inoculation', 'sinopharm', 'december', 'psg_commander', 'admit', 'psg', 'receive', 'vaccine', 'early', 'product', 'receive', 'authorization', 'inoculation', 'psg', 'personnel', 'come', 'light', 'duterte', 'bare', 'member', 'military', 'already', 'receive', 'sinopharm', 'say', 'unit', 'acquire', 'free', 'refuse', 'disclose', 'source', 'accord', 'military', 'personnel', 'inject', 'unauthorized', 'vaccine', 'military', 'involve', 'vaccination', 'durante', 'defend', 'inoculation', 'say', 'duterte', 'close', 'security', 'detail', 'need', 'ensure', 'threat', 'president', 'health', 'safety', 'sinopharm', 'deny', 'supply', 'use', 'psg', 'personnel', 'sole', 'distributor', 'lbg']",0.8442,0.061,0.815,0.124,0.34865079365079354,Positive

Of these 20 million doses, 10 million will be allocated for the private sector, while the remaining 10 million will be for the government.

This is more expensive compared to Pfizer-BioNTech (P2,379); Gamaleya (P1,220); COVAX Facility (P854); AstraZeneca (P610); and Novavax (P366).
Some lawmakers then called on the government to reconsider the purchase of Sinovac vaccine doses because it was allegedly more costly and less effective.
Facing the hearing, coronavirus response officials Carlito Galvez and Vince Dizon said the Philippines may still turn its back on 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Chinese firm Sinovac. 
“If the vaccine-expert panel does not recommend a certain vaccine, then the Philippine government will not purchase and will not administer the vaccine,” explained Dizon.

A total of 600,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Sinovac — a donation from China — are expected to arrive at the Villamor Airbase on Sunday afternoon, of which 100,000 doses will be allocated to the Philippine military.
President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to personally welcome the arrival of the Chinese vaccines, according to his former close aide, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go.
On Monday, 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine will also be delivered to the Philippines around noontime, said presidential spokesperson Harry Roque. The AstraZeneca delivery was part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX facility.

Galvez said the initial doses of vaccines will be administered at the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and other major hospitals. PGH and Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City have begun preparing to receive and manage the first batch of vaccine arrivals.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and Galvez are set to receive Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine shots on Monday morning to boost public confidence in the vaccine, Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go said Sunday.
Prior to the expected arrival of the vaccines, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had granted Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines emergency use authorization (EUA).
“Ito po ay isang pagpapatunay na ang lahat ng mga bakuna na ating ituturok sa ating mga kababayan ay ligtas at epektibo,” Galvez said.
""Kaya’t hinihikayat po namin ang ating mga kababayang Pilipino na magparehistro na sa kanilang mga barangay at upang kayo ay makapagpabakuna na,” he added.
Healthcare workers
The PGH Physicians' Association, however, said the Sinovac vaccine should undergo further appraisal by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) before being administered to healthcare workers.
The association said the expected administration of the Sinovac vaccine at PGH was met with a “sweeping disapproval rate of 95 percent” among the hospital's residents and fellows.
Although Sinovac was given EUA by the FDA, it was not recommended for healthcare workers due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4% for the group.
Still, the Department of Health has said the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group has agreed to recommend Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccines for health workers.
“We recognize the efforts of the PGH Administration in hastening the vaccination process for its constituents. However, the vaccination plan should have been handled with more prudence and transparency,” the PGH Physicians' Association said.
“As the national university hospital, PGH should set an example on how vaccination rollout should be executed in the country. PGH should uphold the ideals of ethical and evidence-based medicine, for which it has been a bastion of,” it added.
Indemnity fund
Last Friday, Duterte also signed into law the Vaccination Program Act of 2021 which would expedite the rollout of the country's vaccination program against COVID-19.
The measure also provides a P500-million indemnity fund for individuals who will experience adverse effects after getting the jab.
Galvez welcomed the passage of the law, saying that it would provide flexibility and indemnity in the procurement and administration of the vaccines.

In a Dobol B sa News TV interview, Vargas said that while LGUs' vaccination efforts are laudable, there is a need to know why they are conducting online pre-registration instead of just validating the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) list.
""Dapat kasi sa LGU, tahanan sila ng senior citizens, at yung tinatawag na indigents o mahihirap. So ano yung purpose ng pre-registration? Hindi ba dapat more on validation?"" he said.

Vargas said that while local governments are awaiting the arrival of the vaccines, they should already be doing the validation of the priority list.

WHO country representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the study that found reduced efficacy of the AstraZeneca jab on patients with the South Africa variant only had a “very small sample” of less than 2,000 people. 
“We still believe that the AstraZeneca vaccine is effective even in places where you have a large proportion of cases which could be attributed to the B.1.351 or the South Africa variant,” he said in a virtual briefing.
A molecular biologist on Wednesday warned that the AstraZeneca shot could be rendered ineffective if the Philippines fails to curb the spread of the South Africa variant. 
The Department of Health earlier explained that the new variant is more transmissible and contains a mutation that could cause reduced vaccine efficacy.

“The FGD just showed na ito ‘yung gusto nilang makita na, ‘Ah, actually even leaders pala gagawin. Mauna kayo bago kami.’ That’s actually the narrative we see in social media so that’s also what we’ve gotten from the FGDs,” she said in a virtual briefing.
Ho said a similar study on childhood vaccination conducted two years ago also found that health workers influence public confidence in inoculation.
“Do’n sa third party na nag-study for us, actually ‘yung top 3 main influencers for people to get vaccinated are one, DOH; two, their healthcare providers; and three is their family or relatives. That’s two years ago,” she said.

But the health official said there is no urgent need for government officials to get vaccinated since health workers are being prioritized in the rollout.
“It might be needed, but considering the first group of people that we’re vaccinating sa hierarchy natin ng priority, mas kailangan natin ng other healthcare worker influencers,” Ho explained.
Several government officials such as vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. and testing czar Secretary Vince Dizon got vaccinated on the first day of the rollout. 
President Rodrigo Duterte, meanwhile, will wait for regulatory authorities to approve the vaccine developed by China’s Sinopharm.

Ho also said according to medical chiefs, more health workers have been following through with their pre-registration for the Sinovac jab.

Galvez made the statement a day after the United Kingdom started its mass COVID-19 vaccination program on Tuesday with a vaccine supply from Pfizer proven to be 95% effective after human trials.
""Our target this year is 25 million. Based on the availability of the vaccine, we can expand it to 30 to 35 million,” he said in an ANC interview.
Of the said number, Galvez said health care and other essential workers account for around three million.
The Philippines has only secured 2.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British firm AstraZeneca thus far, a volume which is only good for one million people.

As this developed, the Philippine government is still negotiating on securing COVID-19 vaccine supply from pharmaceutical firms Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson and Johnson, Sinovac, and Gamaleya, among others.
Only COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna (both 95%) and AstraZeneca (90%) have been proven largely effective after human trials so far.
The Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration, however, is yet to issue an emergency use authorization on any COVID-19 vaccine.
Galvez asked the public for patience, saying that it is expected that countries with more resources and the country of origin of the COVID-19 vaccines found over 90% effective such as Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca will prioritize its residents since their governments also financed the development of the vaccines.
“Sila po ang nag-finance, sa kanila po galing iyong bakuna, kaya sila po talaga ang mauunang mag-roll out [for mass vaccination],” he said.
“Ang nakikita po natin sa Pfizer at sa iba pang leading vaccines, iyong production po nila for first and second quarter nakuha na po ng rich countries. Ang natitira po sa atin, mga last portion of second quarter to third quarter [darating]. Iyon po ang reality,” he added.
Still, Galvez is confident that the mass COVID-19 vaccination in the country can begin in March or April, starting with vaccines from Chinese firms Sinovac and CanSino.
“These are already approved for emergency use authorization in China and we will ask them to increase their volume [of production for the Philippines] since they will also conduct a clinical trial here,” he said.
“Sana makuha natin ng by first quarter of next year. We are still in negotiation, but there is more confidence in Sinovac because they already gave 1.8 million and 1.2 million doses COVID-19 vaccines in Brazil and Indonesia,” he added.

Margaret Keenan received the jab at about 6:45 a.m., marking the start of a historic mass vaccination program.
Parsons said it was a “huge honor” to be the first in the UK to deliver the vaccine to a patient.
“I’m just glad that I’m able to play a part in this historic day. The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,” Parsons, who has worked in the NHS for 24 years, said.

“I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against COVID-19, it’s the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year,” she said.
Vaccines will be administered at 50 hospital hubs in the UK with patients aged 80 and above who are already attending hospital as  an outpatient and those who are being discharged home after a hospital stay first in line to receive it, the report said.
Several million doses of the vaccine are expected to arrive in the UK in December. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government hopes to start rolling out the vaccine in care homes before Christmas.
Britain became the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for use.

Molecular biologist and OCTA Research fellow Fr. Nicanor Austriaco said that the Philippines should eliminate the B.1.351 variant since it is a potential stumbling block on the road towards achieving herd immunity.
He said South Africa recently halted the rollout of the vaccine because a study showed that it significantly reduced the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca shots.
""It’s no different [from] injecting water into the patients. With 10% protection, basically, most people would still be able to get mild and moderate COVID-19,"" Austriaco told a virtual press briefing.
“If we do not eliminate the B.1.351 variant in the Philippines, which was first identified yesterday in Pasay, the 17 million doses of AstraZeneca that we have already bought but have not yet arrived will be ineffective against fighting this particular variant from South Africa,” he added.

The Philippines is expected to receive an initial 487,200 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine on Thursday with frontline health workers as priority recipients.
“If it is not controlled, if it is not eliminated from the islands, [it will be] more difficult for us to vaccinate the 75 million Filipinos in order to acquire herd immunity,” Austriaco said. 
He also said a person who received the two-dose vaccine should get a booster shot.

The latest directive complements the earlier DOE order to power distribution utilities issued on February 16, 2021 for the same purpose. 
In an advisory dated March 2, 2021, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi ordered power generation firms, including government owned and controlled corporations as well as private sector-operated and/or owned generation facilities, to undertake the following:
Ensure availability of generating facilities at the maximum dependable capacity
Compliance with the Grid Operating and Maintenance Program for 2021
Manage the water reservoir to have optimal production of hydroelectric power plants when they are most needed
Secure adequate fuel supplies and maintain reasonable fuel inventories
Arrange back-up personnel in power plants and additional maintenance crew to assist in case of emergencies
Augment security forces in major power plant installations, as needed
Ensure that emergency response protocols and Business Continuity Plans are updated to include utmost prioritization of COVID-19 vaccine cold storage facilities and healthcare facilities in cases of power outages
Provide necessary support for COVID-19 vaccine cold storage facilities and healthcare facilities installing their own back-up power supply, as needed
Coordinate with concerned local government units regarding the locations/stations of cold storage facilities for COVID-19 vaccines
“The DOE is working non-stop to establish an uninterrupted supply of electricity services at the onset of the vaccine rollout by the end of Q1 of 2021. We have been meeting with the members of the energy family to fortify our strategies,” Cusi said. — Ted Cordero/RSJ, GMA News

“Hindi naman kinakailangan na ipakitang live ‘yan, but in any case it’s the President’s decision. I will not second-guess the President.”

Duque said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) submitted the needed documents to the HTAC last week.
The HTAC is an independent advisory body tasked to guide the Department of Health and the Philippine Health Insurance Corporation.
“As we speak, they’re already doing it. Ang problema lang, nahuli kasi naming natanggap ‘yung mga trial data from Sinovac,” he said in an interview on ANC.
“The HTAC is also doing an evaluation already of the Sinovac because we will also procure. In fact, what we expect is about mid- to third week of March we would be able to see the procured one million doses of Sinovac,” he added.

Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine might have better efficacy in Philippines —expert
Roque won't get Sinovac jab for now
Sinovac vaccines arrive in Cebu, Davao; rollout on Thursday, Friday
The government plans to purchase one million Sinovac doses this month to augment the 600,000 doses donated by the Chinese government.
Doctors from the Philippine General Hospital as well as Vice President Leni Robredo earlier called for an HTAC review of the Sinovac jab to ensure “informed decision-making.”
Duque maintained that the law does not mandate an HTAC evaluation for donated vaccines.
“In the first place, the safety efficacy evaluation is the mandate of the FDA. So the HTAC is really an economic tool to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the vaccines. But because this is not to be procured, the FDA evaluation of risk-benefit analysis suffices,” he said.
The HTAC has already cleared the Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines, millions of doses of which will be donated to the Philippines by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility.
“The difference is AstraZeneca and Pfizer had submitted their trial data much earlier and these trial data were published in journals so there was time for HTAC to do it,” Duque said.
Dr. Ernesto Domingo, a Ramon Magsaysay Awardee and a professor at the University of the Philippines College of Medicine, for his part, said that the Sinovac vaccine does not need an HTAC appraisal before it could be given to healthcare workers in accordance with the Universal Healthcare Law.
""No, my answer is you don't need the HTAC to go over this for the vaccine to be given. So I agree, the rollout, it should continue,"" said  at a Palace briefing.
""It's all there. We know what it is supposed to do, what it can do, what we have to be aware of,"" Domingo added, saying other international bodies, including the World Health Organization (WHO), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), have given their approval for Sinovac.
""When it comes to our place, our own FDA (Food and Drug Administration) said 'Yes you can use it.' I don't see any reason why it should be subjected to HTAC discussion,"" Domingo said.
Domingo was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for his work on vaccinating babies against Hepatitis B and almost eliminating the chance of their getting infected.
The Philippines began its COVID-19 vaccination program with the rollout of 600,000 Sinovac doses on Monday.

Ong said the vaccine passport may be used as an identification system that allows people to access public facilities and participate in mass gatherings without needing face masks or face shields.

In effect, the vaccine passport will serve as proof that the holder is safe to mingle with other people and engage in activities even without wearing face masks or face shields and observing social distancing.
Under the measure, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19, particularly the Department of Health, Department of Tourism, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), the Department of Trade and Industry, and the Department of Transportation, is mandated to “coordinate and provide for a single internationally-recognized vaccine passport to serve as proof that a person has been vaccinated against COVID-19.”
The said vaccine passport should be issued ""as a matter of right whether or not the person availed of the free vaccination program of the government or was vaccinated through personal and other means.""
Contents of the vaccine passport should include the basic personal information of the holder such as full name, address, date of birth; type and purpose of vaccine, batch number, date administered and the name of the entity that administered the vaccine; and other relevant medical information.
The IATF is also mandated under the measure to list down and regularly update the exemptions or activities allowed for holders of the COVID-19 vaccine passport, including:
International and domestic travel, including non-essential travel;
Employment abroad;
Local checkpoint and quarantine exemptions;
Opening of and Access to some business establishments; and
Post-vaccination protocols applicable to Vaccine Passport holders, as may be determined by the IATF, in relation to rules on public gatherings, use of face mask and face shield, etc.
Production and possession of forged or fake vaccine passport will be penalized under RA 8239 or the Passport Act of 1996, the measure indicated.
These acts may also serve as grounds for the IATF to deny a vaccine passport application, or revoke an already issued one, it added. --KBK, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.9315000176429749,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['measure', 'file', 'house', 'representative', 'provide', 'immunization', 'passport', 'person', 'receive', 'shot', 'order', 'systematize', 'implementation', 'countrys', 'mass', 'vaccination', 'probinsyano', 'party', 'list', 'representative', 'ronnie', 'monday', 'file', 'house', 'bill', 'wherein', 'stress', 'need', 'unhampered', 'implementation', 'maximization', 'government', 'immunization', 'program', 'inoculation', 'still', 'month', 'away', 'enter', 'border', 'proper', 'take', 'preparation', 'necessary', 'step', 'unhampered', 'implementation', 'maximization', 'ong', 'say', 'line', 'hope', 'bill', 'consider', 'approve', 'soon', 'possible', 'time', 'possible', 'roll', 'june', 'order', 'restore', 'people', 'trust', 'confidence', 'travel', 'end', 'view', 'revive', 'bolster', 'economy', 'add', 'ong', 'say', 'passport', 'use', 'identification', 'system', 'allow', 'people', 'access', 'public', 'facility', 'participate', 'mass', 'gathering', 'need', 'face_mask', 'face', 'shield', 'story', 'guest', 'undergo', 'swab', 'test', 'pacquiao', 'say', 'birthday', 'party', 'congress', 'reach', 'deal', 'relief', 'package', 'hong', 'kong', 'police', 'catch', 'fugitive', 'patient', 'effect', 'passport', 'serve', 'proof', 'holder', 'safe', 'mingle', 'people', 'engage', 'activity', 'even', 'wear', 'face_mask', 'face', 'shield', 'observe', 'social_distance', 'measure', 'inter_agency', 'iatf', 'particularly', 'department', 'health', 'department', 'tourism', 'department', 'dfa', 'department', 'trade', 'industry', 'department', 'transportation', 'mandate', 'coordinate', 'provide', 'single', 'internationally', 'recognize', 'passport', 'serve', 'proof', 'person', 'vaccinate', 'say', 'passport', 'issue', 'matter', 'right', 'person', 'avail', 'free', 'government', 'vaccinate', 'personal', 'mean', 'content', 'passport', 'include', 'basic', 'personal', 'information', 'holder', 'full', 'name', 'address', 'date', 'birth', 'type', 'purpose', 'batch', 'number', 'date', 'administer', 'name', 'entity', 'administer', 'relevant', 'medical', 'information', 'iatf', 'also', 'mandate', 'measure', 'list', 'regularly', 'update', 'exemption', 'activity', 'allow', 'holder', 'passport', 'include', 'international', 'domestic', 'travel', 'include', 'non', 'essential', 'travel', 'employment', 'abroad', 'local', 'checkpoint', 'quarantine', 'exemption', 'open', 'access', 'business', 'establishment', 'post', 'vaccination', 'protocol', 'applicable', 'passport', 'holder', 'determine', 'iatf', 'relation', 'rule', 'public', 'gathering', 'use', 'face', 'mask', 'face', 'shield', 'production', 'possession', 'forge', 'fake', 'passport', 'penalize', 'ra', 'passport', 'act', 'measure', 'indicate', 'act', 'also', 'serve', 'ground', 'iatf', 'deny', 'passport', 'application', 'revoke', 'already', 'issue', 'add', 'kbk']",0.9756,0.029,0.838,0.133,0.43771749084249084,Positive

Aside from this, the Philippines over the weekend inked the term sheet to secure 30 million doses of the Covovax vaccine to be manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), which has partnered with Faberco Life Sciences Inc. as its Philippine partner. — Jon Viktor D.

""Walang sapilitan, walang mahuhuli sa pila, walang mawawala sa pila,"" Roque said in a press briefing.
The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) approved the recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and the Department of Health’s Technical Advisory Group (TAG) to allot Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines for healthcare workers.
""Sabi sa DOH briefing kahapon, ligtas ang bakuna ng Sinovac. Ito ay safe vaccine at mapapakinabangan or beneficial ito sa healthcare workers,"" Roque said.
""Dagdag pa ng DOH, binibigyan ang healthcare workers ng pagkakataong pumili ng bakunang nais nila,"" he added.

""Ang pagbabago po sa ating protocol, kung ayaw po ng healthcare worker ang Sinovac, pupuwede po siyang tumanggi at hindi mawawala 'yung kanyang prayoridad kapag dumating na ang bakunang gusto niya,"" Roque said.
""Pero pang-healthcare workers lang po 'yan ha. Sa lahat po kinakailangan pa rin talaga kung ano po ang naririyan ay tatanggapin natin. Kung ayaw naman po ay wala talagang sapilitan,"" the Palace official said.
Sinovac is administered in two doses and has been found to have an efficacy rate of 65% to 91% among clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old, based on the findings of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration.
The FDA  granted emergency use authorization to Sinovac on Monday but did not recommend it for health workers, the top priority in the vaccination program, due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4% in the said group.
The donation of China of 600,000 doses of Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines will arrive at 5 p.m. on Sunday afternoon in the country. Of this number, 100,000 doses were reserved for the Armed Forces of the Philippines tapped to secure the transport of COVID-19 vaccines to health care facilities.
President Rodrigo Duterte is expected to welcome the arrival of the vaccines, together with other officials, at the Villamor Airbase.
""Excited na kami dahil bukas dadating na po ang bakuna,"" Roque said.
Roque added he will also be there together with Senator Christopher ""Bong"" Go and other Cabinet officials.
A special press briefing will be held on Sunday about the vaccines' arrival, he said.
Asked when the Cabinet officials who volunteered to get the vaccine would be inoculated, Roque said they will prioritize healthcare workers first.
""Inuuna po muna natin ang ating mga healthcare workers dahil sa pag-aaral, mas makakabigay ng kumpiyansa sa taumbayan kung makikita nila ang mga healthcare workers na maunang mabakunahan,"" he said. —KG, GMA News",GMA News,4.0,0.8302000164985657,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['harry_roque', 'saturday', 'reiterate', 'healthcare_worker', 'choose', 'get', 'sinovac', 'lose', 'priority', 'government', 'immunization', 'program', 'walang', 'sapilitan', 'walang', 'mahuhuli', 'pila', 'roque', 'say', 'press_briefe', 'management', 'eid', 'approve', 'recommendation', 'national', 'nitag', 'department', 'health', 'group', 'tag', 'allot', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'healthcare_worker', 'doh', 'briefing', 'kahapon', 'bakuna', 'ng', 'safe', 'beneficial', 'ito', 'roque', 'say', 'dagdag', 'ng', 'doh', 'ang', 'ng', 'ng', 'nais', 'add', 'story', 'naia', 'commercial', 'flight', 'affect', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'arrival', 'uniform', 'travel', 'protocol', 'lgus', 'concern', 'say', 'iatf', 'uniform', 'travel', 'protocol', 'lgus', 'rt', 'pcr', 'test', 'specify', 'ang', 'po', 'ate', 'protocol', 'kung', 'ayaw', 'healthcare', 'worker', 'ang', 'pupuwede', 'po', 'siyang', 'tumanggi', 'hindi', 'yung', 'kanyang', 'prayoridad', 'kapag', 'dumate', 'na', 'gusto', 'niya', 'roque', 'say', 'po', 'sa', 'lahat', 'po', 'talaga', 'naririyan', 'natin', 'kung', 'ayaw', 'naman', 'po', 'wala', 'talagang', 'sapilitan', 'palace', 'official', 'say', 'sinovac', 'administer', 'dose', 'find', 'clinically', 'old', 'base', 'finding', 'food', 'fda', 'granted_emergency', 'use_authorization', 'sinovac', 'monday', 'recommend', 'health', 'worker', 'top', 'priority', 'low', 'say', 'group', 'donation', 'china', 'dose', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'arrive', 'sunday', 'afternoon', 'country', 'number', 'dose', 'reserve', 'armed_force', 'tap', 'secure', 'transport', 'vaccine', 'health', 'care', 'facility', 'duterte', 'expect', 'welcome', 'arrival', 'vaccine', 'together', 'official', 'villamor', 'airbase', 'excited', 'kami', 'bukas', 'dadate', 'po', 'bakuna', 'roque', 'say', 'roque', 'add', 'also', 'together', 'cabinet', 'official', 'special', 'press_briefe', 'hold', 'sunday', 'vaccine', 'arrival', 'say', 'ask', 'cabinet', 'official', 'volunteer', 'get', 'inoculate', 'roque', 'say', 'prioritize', 'healthcare_worker', 'first', 'po', 'muna', 'natin', 'ang', 'ate', 'mga', 'healthcare_worker', 'sa', 'pag', 'aaral', 'makakabigay', 'ng', 'kumpiyansa', 'sa', 'taumbayan', 'kung', 'makikita', 'nila', 'ang', 'mga', 'na', 'mabakunahan', 'say', 'kg']",-0.836,0.116,0.787,0.097,0.514069264069264,Negative

At least 38,400 doses more from AstraZeneca are expected to arrive on Sunday.
With around 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine that will be delivered until May, Galvez said the country will have 1.5 million doses every month.
On the other hand, the Department of Health on Saturday convened members of different hospitals in Metro Manila for a meeting to address the recent spike in hospital admissions amid the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the country.
The Philippines began its COVID-19 vaccination program on March 1, following the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines, which was immediately followed by 487,000 doses from AstraZeneca.
Nograles said that more batches of COVID-19 vaccines are coming throughout March.
He acknowledged that although there are supply limitations on Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines, the Philippines still have six other vaccines to get supplies from.

“There’s a task force for the vaccine. The role of NEDA there, we are a member there. I actually offered to the task force, that Secretary (Carlito) Galvez is heading, the possibility of using the National ID as one of the basis for the distribution [of the vaccine],” Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick Chua said during the virtual Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum.
“The vaccine is really a health response and NEDA is not a health expert or vaccine expert but because of the National ID we can help in that aspect,” Chua said.
Nearly 25 million Filipinos composed of frontline health workers, the poor and uniformed personnel will be among the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as the country eyes to begin its mass immunization program within the first half of 2021.
National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said that the government is targeting to inoculate 60% to 70% of the population, which be sufficient to create herd immunity.

The national ID, on the other hand, is prioritizing the registration of nine million low-income household heads from 32 priority provinces.
The select provinces include Ilocos Sur, La Union, Pangasinan, Cagayan, Isabela, Bataan, Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Tarlac, Zambales, Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Quezon, Rizal, Albay, Camarines Sur, Masbate, Antique, Capiz, Iloilo, Negros Occidental, Bohol, Cebu, Negros Oriental, Davao de Oro, Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Occidental, Leyte, and Tawi-tawi.
“As of December 11, we have already registered 8.7 million for Step 1. We are hoping by the end of the year we will exceed 10 million,” Chua said.
The Step 1 of PhilSys registration involves the house-to-house collection of the demographic information of low-income household heads in the priority provinces.
“Step 2, we will begin in January... Step 3, starting Feb they will get their national ID,” the NEDA chief said.
The Philippine Statistics Authority is set to begin Step 2 of PhilSys registration, which will involve the capture of biometric information, such as fingerprints and iris scans and a front-facing photograph at registration centers, once the required systems are fully functional and secure.
Among the major preparatory activities for Step 2 is the deployment of more than 4,000 registration kits to the target provinces.
The Step 3 will involve the issuance of the PhilSys Number (PSN) and the physical ID (PhilID).
“How is it helpful for COVID? We realized that of the 8.7 million that we registered for Step 1, 89% do not have bank accounts because they have no IDs or other requirements,” Chua said.
The NEDA chief said the government is planning to have Land Bank of the Philippines collocate in biometrics registration centers so that bank account opening process can coincide with the national ID data collection procedure.
Chua said the government is eyeing to make all 18 million or 20 million unbanked low-income Filipinos have bank accounts by the end of next year.
In the proposed budget for next year, around P2.5 billion is allocated for the Department of Health for its purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.

A vaccine needs to secure an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for it to be legally administered in the Philippines.
Sinopharm has yet to apply for an EUA before the FDA.
The FDA, however, can allow the use of the vaccine without EUA approval provided that the vaccine secured a compassionate use permit.
The issuance of compassionate use permit, however, does not amount to stamp of approval from the FDA.
Smuggled vaccines
Roque earlier said that the President prefers to be inoculated with a Sinopharm vaccine.
Former broadcaster Mon Tulfo, who has served as the country’s special envoy to China, has revealed that he, some senators and Cabinet members had received their two doses of smuggled Sinopharm vaccine in October 2020 and that Duterte also wanted to have the Sinopharm jab.
Roque could not say if Tulfo’s claims that the President wanted the same vaccine for his family members were true.
Nevertheless, Roque assured the public on Monday that the President will take his COVID-19 vaccine in public view.
“It will be in public, and you will be informed if there will be side effects on the President,” he said.
Roque, however, clarified that the Constitutional provision requiring disclosure of the President’s health condition has limits.
“Ang sinasabi po sa Konstitusyon, iyong kailangang sabihin ay seryosong pagkakasakit lamang,” Roque said.
Presidential Security Group commander Brigadier General Jesus Durante III admitted in December 2020 that they got vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine.
Durante made the admission after Duterte claimed during a televised address that some members of the military received shots of COVID-19 vaccine supposedly manufactured by  Sinopharm.
Durante said the vaccines they received were donated but he did not identify the source. —KBK, GMA News",GMA News,1.0,0.9955000281333923,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['malacanang', 'legal', 'team', 'study', 'duterte', 'administer', 'manufacture', 'say', 'monday', 'roque', 'early', 'say', 'year', 'old', 'duterte', 'prefer', 'inoculate', 'sinopharm', 'aaralan', 'ng', 'legal', 'team', 'president', 'commander', 'chief', 'roque', 'say', 'pong', 'desisyon', 'government', 'officially', 'start', 'national', 'use', 'sinovac', 'vaccine', 'donate', 'china', 'story', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'part', 'solution', 'say', 'doctor', 'indonesia', 'bali', 'kick', 'drive', 'virus', 'jab', 'hospitality', 'worker', 'coronavirus', 'infection', 'rise', 'first', 'time', 'week', 'say', 'need', 'secure', 'authorization', 'food', 'fda', 'sinopharm', 'yet', 'apply', 'however', 'allow', 'use', 'approval', 'provide', 'secure', 'permit', 'issuance', 'compassionate_use', 'permit', 'however', 'amount', 'stamp', 'approval', 'fda', 'smuggle', 'vaccine', 'roque', 'early', 'say', 'president', 'prefer', 'inoculate', 'sinopharm', 'former', 'broadcaster', 'mon_tulfo', 'serve', 'country', 'special', 'envoy', 'china', 'reveal', 'senator', 'receive', 'dose', 'smuggle', 'october', 'duterte', 'also', 'want', 'sinopharm', 'jab', 'roque', 'tulfo', 'claim', 'president', 'want', 'family', 'member', 'true', 'nevertheless', 'roque', 'assure', 'public', 'president', 'take', 'public', 'view', 'public', 'informed', 'side_effect', 'president', 'say', 'roque', 'however', 'clarify', 'constitutional', 'provision', 'require', 'disclosure', 'president', 'health', 'condition', 'limit', 'ang', 'sinasabi', 'konstitusyon', 'iyong', 'kailangang', 'sabihin', 'seryosong', 'pagkakasakit', 'lamang', 'roque', 'say', 'group', 'admit', 'december', 'get', 'vaccinate', 'durante', 'make', 'admission', 'duterte', 'claim', 'member', 'military', 'receive', 'shot', 'supposedly', 'manufacture', 'sinopharm', 'durante', 'say', 'vaccine', 'receive', 'donate', 'identify', 'source', 'kbk']",0.9601,0.026,0.82,0.153,0.2836507936507936,Positive

In December 2020, the FDA approved the clinical trial on the vaccine developed by Janssen Vaccines & Prevention B.V.
The FDA said it continues to accept applications for the conduct of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial in the country. To date, FDA has received three applications which underwent review and assessment of the DOST-VEP and the SJREB.

“The FDA is currently awaiting response to clarifications for the proposed study on the Sinovac Life Sciences vaccine before issuing a decision on the application,” Director General Eric Domingo said.
He added acceptance and review of applications for emergency use authorization (EUA) of COVID-19 vaccines is also underway.
The evaluation of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and AztraZeneca Pharmaceuticals-ChAdOx1-S (recombinant) COVID-19 vaccine is ongoing.
Domingo said the decision of approval is expected to be released within 21 calendar days upon filing of application. He earlier said the decision on Pfizer, which applied in December 2020 will issued by January 14.
AstraZeneca, on the other hand, applied for EUA on January 6, 2021.
The EUA application for Sputnik V developed by Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology- Ministry of Health Russia was received on January 7 2021. Prior to this, Gamaleya withdrew its application to conduct clinical trials in the Philippines.
“The submission was pre-assessed and the applicant was instructed to comply with the lacking documents,” Domingo said.—AOL, GMA News

PANTI,2020-12-14 11:18:00,"Chinese firm Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine is being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration even if it has yet to be approved by the Ethics Review Board, the Department of Health (DOH) said Monday. 
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire noted that this evaluation was above board and preliminary, considering that Sinovac has already secured the approval of the Vaccine Experts Panel (VEP) under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST).
“ON FDA evaluating Sinovac, that is an internal agreement between the Task Group composed of the FDA, DOST and DOH. Sistema ito na kapag na-approve na ng VEP ang produkto, FDA can initially evaluate iyong mga dokumento para hindi makatagal [sa proseso], while we wait for the Ethics Board [approval],” Vergeire said. 
The VEP under DOST reviews the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the candidate vaccine, while the Ethics Board evaluates the selection of participants for human clinical trials, among other safeguards that the vaccine manufacturer provided for participants. 
The evaluation of VEP and Ethics Board are done simultaneously.

Vergeire, however, stressed that Sinovac will not be approved by FDA without an approval from the Ethics Board. 
“Hindi po magkakaroon ng FDA approval if the regulatory process is not complied with,” Vergeire added.
Malacanang said last week Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine remains the country’s top pick for its immunisation program despite bribery claims hounding the Beijing-based firm.
The Palace expressed confidence in the vaccine review process to be conducted by the FDA, whose chief, Eric Domingo, enjoys the full trust of President Rodrigo Duterte, according to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.
Earlier this month, Indonesia received its first shipment of Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine as its government prepares a mass inoculation program.
Only COVID-19 vaccines made by American companies Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and British firm AstraZeneca have been proven to be at least 90% effective after human trials so far.
United Kingdom has started its national vaccination against COVID-19 last week with a vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech, while the United States and Canada are due to follow suit this week. 
The Philippines, on the other hand, has secured only 2.6 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine of AstraZeneca so far, courtesy of funding from the private sector. 
AstraZeneca, however, has only secured Ethics Review Board approval thus far. 
The Philippines has recorded 449,400 COVID-19 cases so far. Of this number, 418,687 recovered while 8,733 died.

According to Luisito Santos’ report on Super Radyo dzBB, Domingo said AstraZeneca indicated that it already had sufficient data to see the efficacy of its vaccine.
Domingo, however, clarified that AstraZeneca may still supply vaccines in the Philippines once it gets a green light from the FDA.
In late November, the Department of Health said AstraZeneca would continue clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines after it registered impressive results in the United Kingdom.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said it was best that COVID-19 vaccines manufactured abroad conduct clinical trials in the country.

Positive results from final stage trials of several vaccine candidates have raised hopes that there is light at the end of the tunnel in the quest to curb a pandemic that has already killed nearly 1.4 million people worldwide.
How many in the pipeline?
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 48 ""candidate vaccines"" at the stage of clinical trials in humans by mid-November, up from 11 in mid-June.
Eleven of them are at the most advanced ""Phase 3"" stage, in which a vaccine's effectiveness is tested on a large scale, generally on tens of thousands of people across several continents.

A European project led by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca on Monday said an interim analysis of its phase 3 trials showed their vaccine had an average 70 percent efficacy in trials involved 23,000 people.
The statement said the drug showed a 62 percent efficacy when people were given two full doses, but this rose to 90 percent in those given only a half dose initially followed by a full dose.
It said the vaccine could be stored, transported and handled ""at normal refrigerated conditions"" for at least six months and announced plans to develop up to three billion doses in 2021, if it passes the remaining regulatory hurdles.
The announcement comes after a US-German collaboration between Pfizer and BioNTech reported early in November that phase 3 trials for its mRNA vaccine showed 90 percent efficacy in preventing COVID-19 symptoms and did not produce adverse side effects among thousands of volunteers.
It has since announced further trial results showing the vaccine works 95 percent of the time.
""Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics,"" the company said.
Pfizer is currently seeking Emergency Use Authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and expects to roll out 1.3 billion doses by the end of next year.
Also this month, US biotech firm Moderna said its vaccine also showed almost 95 percent efficacy.
Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval in the US and around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
The company is on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021, it said.
In addition, several state-run Chinese labs are also thought to have produced among the more promising candidate vaccines.
Russia, meanwhile, has already registered two COVID-19 vaccines, even before clinical trials were completed.
What kind of vaccines?
Some methods for making a vaccine are tried-and-tested, while others remain experimental.
Inactivated traditional vaccines use a virus germ that has been killed, while others use a weakened or ""attenuated"" strain.
These vaccines work when the body treats the deactivated pathogen as if it were a real threat, producing antibodies to kill it without endangering the patient with full infection.
So-called ""sub-unit"" vaccines contain a fragment of the virus or bacteria they are derived from to produce a similar immune response.
""Viral vector"" varieties deliver fragments of viral DNA into cells, often hitching a lift off of other virus molecules.
For example, a measles virus modified with a coronavirus protein—the apparatus SARS-CoV-2 uses to latch on to human cells—can by deployed to provide immunity to COVID-19.
Both Pfizer's and Moderna's vaccines are based on cutting-edge technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called messenger RNA to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
Safety first
Trials of two candidate vaccines—made by Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly—were ""paused"" recently over safety concerns.
But that is not necessarily bad news, said Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.
""The fact that trials are paused should indicate that there should be confidence that the whole process of monitoring the safety of trial participants is working well,"" he said.
Recent cases in which recovered COVID patients were infected a second time with a new strain also raise the question of how long vaccines might last.
In October, the US FDA said it would need to see two months of follow-up data after vaccination before giving emergency authorization for any vaccine use. 
""What is different for COVID-19 vaccines is that speed of development and potential approval is much faster due to the public health emergency,"" noted the European Medicines Agency (EMA).
But even that pressing need cannot overcome the rules.
""Before approval, all vaccines in the European Union are evaluated against the same high standards as any other medicine,"" the EMA said in a statement. — AFP",GMA News,1.0,0.9980000257492065,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['paris', 'dozen', 'company', 'biotech', 'start', 'up', 'big', 'pharma', 'racing', 'develop', 'safe', 'effective', 'coronavirus', 'meet', 'urgent', 'medical', 'need', 'potential', 'payday', 'positive', 'result', 'final', 'stage', 'trial', 'several', 'candidate', 'raise', 'hope', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'quest', 'curb', 'pandemic', 'already', 'kill', 'nearly', 'people', 'worldwide', 'many', 'pipeline', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'identify', 'candidate', 'vaccine', 'stage', 'clinical_trial', 'human', 'mid', 'june', 'advanced', 'phase', 'stage', 'vaccine', 'effectiveness', 'test', 'large_scale', 'generally', 'ten', 'thousand', 'people', 'several', 'continent', 'story', 'pandemic', 'inflame', 'violence', 'woman', 'new', 'case', 'bring', 'tally', 'typhoon', 'evacuee', 'rizal', 'undergo', 'swab', 'test', 'european', 'project', 'lead', 'university', 'oxford', 'astrazeneca', 'say', 'phase', 'trial', 'show', 'average', 'percent', 'efficacy', 'trial', 'involve', 'people', 'statement', 'say', 'drug', 'show', 'percent', 'efficacy', 'people', 'give', 'full', 'dose', 'rise', 'percent', 'give', 'half', 'dose', 'initially', 'follow', 'full', 'dose', 'say', 'store', 'transport', 'handle', 'normal_refrigerate', 'condition', 'least', 'six_months', 'announce', 'plan', 'develop', 'dose', 'pass', 'remain', 'regulatory', 'hurdle', 'announcement', 'come', 'german', 'collaboration', 'report', 'early', 'phase', 'trial', 'mrna', 'show', 'percent', 'efficacy', 'prevent', 'symptom', 'produce', 'adverse', 'side_effect', 'thousand', 'volunteer', 'announce', 'trial', 'result', 'show', 'work', 'percent', 'time', 'efficacy', 'consistent', 'age', 'gender', 'race', 'ethnicity', 'demographic', 'company', 'say', 'pfizer', 'currently', 'seek', 'authorization', 'food', 'fda', 'expect', 'roll', 'dose', 'end', 'also', 'month', 'biotech', 'firm', 'moderna', 'say', 'also', 'show', 'almost', 'percent', 'efficacy', 'moderna', 'plan', 'submit', 'application', 'emergency', 'approval', 'world', 'week', 'say', 'expect', 'approximately', 'dose', 'ready', 'ship', 'end', 'year', 'company', 'track', 'manufacture', 'dose', 'globally', 'say', 'addition', 'several', 'state', 'run', 'chinese', 'lab', 'also', 'think', 'produce', 'promise', 'candidate', 'vaccine', 'russia', 'meanwhile', 'already', 'register', 'vaccine', 'even', 'clinical_trial', 'complete', 'kind', 'vaccine', 'method', 'make', 'try', 'test', 'other', 'remain', 'experimental', 'inactivate', 'traditional', 'vaccine', 'use', 'virus', 'germ', 'kill', 'other', 'use', 'weaken', 'attenuated', 'strain', 'vaccine', 'work', 'body', 'treat', 'deactivate', 'pathogen', 'real', 'threat', 'produce', 'antibody', 'kill', 'endanger', 'patient', 'full', 'infection', 'call', 'sub', 'unit', 'vaccine', 'contain', 'fragment', 'virus', 'bacteria', 'derive', 'produce', 'similar', 'immune_response', 'viral', 'vector', 'variety', 'deliver', 'fragment', 'viral', 'dna', 'cell', 'often', 'hitch', 'lift', 'virus', 'molecule', 'example', 'measle', 'virus', 'modify', 'coronavirus', 'protein', 'apparatus', 'sars_cov', 'use', 'latch', 'human', 'cell', 'deploy', 'provide', 'immunity', 'pfizer', 'vaccine', 'base', 'cut', 'edge', 'technology', 'use', 'synthetic', 'version', 'molecule', 'call', 'hack', 'human', 'cell', 'effectively', 'turn', 'make', 'factory', 'safety', 'first', 'trial', 'candidate', 'vaccine', 'make', 'lilly', 'pause', 'recently', 'safety', 'concern', 'necessarily', 'bad', 'say', 'stephen', 'professor', 'london', 'school', 'hygiene', 'fact', 'trial', 'pause', 'indicate', 'confidence', 'whole', 'process', 'monitor', 'safety', 'trial', 'participant', 'work', 'say', 'recent', 'case', 'recover', 'patient', 'infect', 'second', 'time', 'new', 'strain', 'also', 'raise', 'question', 'long', 'vaccine', 'last', 'october', 'say', 'need', 'see', 'month', 'follow', 'datum', 'vaccination', 'give', 'emergency', 'authorization', 'use', 'different', 'vaccine', 'speed', 'development', 'potential', 'approval', 'much', 'fast', 'due', 'public', 'health', 'emergency', 'note', 'european', 'medicine', 'agency', 'ema', 'even', 'press', 'need', 'overcome', 'rule', 'approval', 'vaccine', 'european_union', 'evaluate', 'high', 'standard', 'medicine', 'ema', 'say', 'statement', 'afp']",0.7579,0.09,0.801,0.109,0.3698366477272728,Positive

The President made the comments during the inauguration of new buildings of Lawang Bato National High School and Canumay East National High School in Valenzuela City, just hours ahead of the expected arrival of 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine Villamor Air Base in Pasay City from the COVAX facility.
“For those of you who would opt to take that vaccine [AstraZeneca], it's fine with me. Doctors are very discriminating, they want Pfizer,” Duterte said.
He was referring to Pfizer-BioNTech whose efficacy rate reached 92% to 95% based on the evaluation of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Despite this high efficacy rate for Pfizer-BioNTech, the President said he is not sold on Western-made vaccines.

“Sa akin, Sinopharm [ang gusto ko]. Hindi ako masyado sa produkto ng mga puti,” Duterte said.
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, jointly developed by American giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech, was the first to get emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA last January 14.
The government has initially said it is reserving 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine from the COVAX facility to health workers, and that the shipment would arrive by mid-February. This timeline has since been scuttled over changing  reasons for their delayed arrival, ranging from lack of a indemnification law to logistical problems.

This, despite President Rodrigo Duterte's earlier order to the Presidential Security Group (PSG) to keep silent on the issue.
""The officials so inoculated must reveal all the information that they have on the unregistered vaccines if only to protect our country against forces seeking to influence the highest office in our land to the detriment of our people,"" De Lima said in Senate Resolution 603.
""Withholding of information on this matter during any investigation serves only to protect criminals who smuggled and are probably still smuggling these illegal vaccines into our country,"" she added.
The Senate Committee of the Whole is scheduled to hold a hearing on the government's COVID-19 immunization plan on Monday.

Duterte previously said some members of the military were already injected with a COVID-19 vaccine made by Chinese firm Sinopharm without an approval from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines confirmed that soldiers who are part of the PSG were the first ones who got vaccinated against COVID-19, ""owing to the nature of their mission and function.""
Some Cabinet members also received it, according to Interior Secretary Eduardo Año.
But a group claiming to be the sole distributor of Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines has denied involvement in the covert inoculation.

PANTI,2021-01-04 16:29:00,"Individuals who get inoculated with unregistered COVID-19 vaccines will not be liable under the law unless they buy or promote the use of these vaccines, Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra said.
Guevarra made the response in light of Senator Ronald “Bato” Dela Rosa saying that he will be willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Dela Rosa also rushed to the defense of the Presidential Security Group (PSG), who admitted that they injected themselves with a non-FDA registered COVID-19 vaccine, saying he would do the same because he is in charge of his life.
“Under our existing laws, a person who freely and voluntarily gets himself inoculated with an unregistered or unauthorized drug or vaccine does not incur any criminal liability, unless he himself has caused its unlawful procurement or promotes its use by other people,” Guevarra said.
Contrary to Dela Rosa’s sentiments, the Justice chief said that FDA’s stamp of approval on vaccines is important.

“Although vaccination is a matter of personal survival, it is important that laws on vaccine approval and administration be strictly observed for the benefit of everyone,” Guevarra pointed out.
“Section 11 of the FDA law prohibits the manufacture, importation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, promotion, etc of any health product that is unregistered with the FDA, and Section 12 thereof imposes the penalty of fine and/or imprisonment,” he added.
Likewise, Guevarra said that persons who knowingly or willfully administer an unregistered vaccine may be held liable under the Medical Practice Act of 1959.
Dela Rosa’s words went, ”FDA-approved o hindi, buhay ko ito, wala akong pakialam diyan sa FDA kung i-approve nila o hindi yan basta buhay ko nakasalalay, I have to decide for my own life.”
Dela Rosa was infected with COVID-19 and was even hospitalized, but he has since recovered from the disease.

The Philippines is expected to begin its immunization program within the first half of the year.

Interviewed on ANC, Dr. Guido David said OCTA disagreed with the statement of Fr. Nicanor Austriaco that the AstraZeneca jab is “no different [from] injecting water” into COVID-19 patients with the South Africa variant. 
“We actually don’t agree with it, that it is ‘sayang lang’ or that it is ineffective. In fact, we also agree with the WHO position,” David said.
Earlier, a WHO official maintained that the AstraZeneca vaccine is still effective even in areas with widespread transmission of the South Africa variant, noting that the study showing otherwise only had a “very small sample” of less than 2,000 patients. 
David also pointed out that the evidence Austriaco cited came from “just one study.”

David said OCTA Research members will convene to discuss and release a statement on their official position on the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine against the South Africa variant.
“We agree that, being in a position where we can make recommendations that people listen to, our statements are very important and how we phrase them is also very important,” he said.

Meanwhile, Dr. Jaime Montoya of the Department of Science and Technology's Philippine Council for Health Research and Development said the private sector’s purchase of more than two million doses of COVID-19 vaccine developed by British-Swedish firm AstraZeneca and Oxford University will be followed by purchase by the Philippine government. —KG, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.7688000202178955,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['lawmaker', 'saturday', 'ask', 'church', 'religious', 'group', 'local', 'government', 'unit', 'pitch', 'cover', 'cost', 'vaccine', 'get', 'filipino', 'vaccinate', 'bhw', 'party', 'list', 'representative', 'co', 'urge', 'follow', 'action', 'business', 'tycoon', 'say', 'sponsor', 'cost', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'private_sector', 'lead', 'tycoon', 'international', 'container', 'terminal', 'service', 'ictsi', 'buy', 'much', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'divide', 'equally', 'government', 'worker', 'frontliner', 'worker', 'logistic', 'sector', 'ictsi', 'executive', 'christian', 'say', 'palace', 'briefing', 'tuesday', 'ask', 'kind', 'benevolent', 'nature', 'church', 'contribution', 'co', 'say', 'national', 'government', 'fund', 'enough', 'say', 'story', 'inoculation', 'use', 'astrazenecas', 'san', 'regulatory', 'nod', 'say', 'want', 'see', 'clinical', 'datum', 'russia', 'sputnik', 'county', 'impose', 'new', 'restriction', 'social', 'gathering', 'magnitude', 'truly', 'whole', 'society', 'fundraising', 'effort', 'need', 'get', 'filipino', 'vaccinate', 'pocket', 'expense', 'receive', 'vaccine', 'co', 'say', 'impossible', 'national', 'government', 'alone', 'carry', 'cost', 'burden', 'need', 'match', 'fund', 'source', 'say', 'finance', 'secretary_carlo', 'early', 'say', 'need', 'purchase', 'population', 'shot', 'get', 'shot', 'potential', 'develop', 'astrazeneca', 'countrys', 'first', 'supply', 'deal', 'coronavirus', 'senior', 'official', 'say', 'friday', 'supply', 'pay', 'private_sector', 'inoculate', 'filipino', 'british', 'drugmaker', 'require', 'dose', 'say', 'jose', 'concepcion', 'government', 'business', 'adviser', 'represent', 'meanwhile', 'department', 'science', 'technologys', 'council', 'health', 'research', 'development', 'say', 'private_sector', 'purchase', 'dose', 'develop', 'firm', 'astrazeneca', 'oxford_university', 'follow', 'purchase', 'government', 'kg']",0.6597,0.055,0.872,0.073,0.3419191919191919,Positive

The Palace expressed confidence in the vaccine review process to be conducted by the Food and Drug Administration, whose chief, Eric Domingo, enjoys the full trust of President Rodrigo Duterte, according to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.
“Consistent po tayo na papayagan lang nating magamit ang mga bakuna na napatunayan nang ligtas at mabisa laban sa COVID-19,” Roque told reporters.
“So pagdating po diyan sa mga allegations on bribery, tingin ko po ay hindi mangyayari iyan sa Pilipinas.”
Roque also said the “target remains that Sinovac will be the first that we can use to vaccinate our people and it will be in the first quarter of next year.”

The Philippines eyes to vaccinate around 25 million people in 2021.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Wednesday said Philippine regulators will validate a report alleging that Sinovac had previously bribed authorities in China to hasten approval for the use of its vaccines.
A Washington Post report said Sinovac’s founder and chief executive Yin Weidong, in a 2016 court testimony, admitted to bribing regulatory authorities in China some $83,000 from 2002 to 2011 to fast track the approval of its vaccines.
Sinovac has applied to hold late-stage trials of its vaccine candidate CoronaVac in the Philippines. Its application is still being evaluated by the government.
As for budget, Senator Sonny Angara, who chairs the Senate Committee on Finance, earlier in the day said the P72.5 billion funding for COVID-19 vaccines under the proposed P4.5-trillion national budget for 2021 is ""solid funding.""
Angara made this assurance in response to concerns about the fact that only P2.5 billion of the said allocation would be under the regular funds of the Department of Health while the rest are tagged as unprogrammed.
Roque, in the same Palace briefing, said the Congress-approved allocation is enough to inoculate 60 million Filipinos.
“Tingin ko po sapat po iyan. Kasi nga doon sa scheme na ipapatupad ng DOF [Department of Finance], hindi pa nga po galing sa national appropriations iyong P72 billion na initially kinakailangan natin para sa 60 million katao na mababakunahan,” he said.--KBK, GMA News

Interviewed on “Unang Balita,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire pointed out that the country only has a limited supply of vaccines at present.
“Kung marami po ang bakuna, siguro po ‘yan ang magiging ideal na patakaran. Pero sa ngayon po hindi pa po natin alam kung sino ang puwede magpabakuna dahil sa kakulangan ng supply,” she said.
As early as 2020, some workers had already expressed concern over their employers’ warning that a “no vaccine, no work” policy would be put in place. 
“Dapat po siguro pag-isipan po ‘yan ng mga may-ari ng kumpanya dahil ito po ay magiging inequitable at maaaring ito ay magkaroon ng epekto lalong lalo na doon sa mga mahihirap natin na workers,” Vergeire said.

President Rodrigo Duterte disclosed on Saturday that many Filipinos, including some from the military, have already received a COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm even as it has yet to get approval from the FDA.
Philippine Army chief Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana confirmed on Monday that some military officials and non-commissioned officers have already been vaccinated against the virus.
Interior Secretary Eduardo Año also said that some Cabinet members as well as personnel from the Presidential Security Group (PSG) were likewise inoculated.
The vulnerable sector should have been prioritized in the immunization against the novel disease, Senator Imee Marcos said in response.
""Walang gulangan sa vaccine! As asserted earlier, the principle should be 'highest risk, first'—not 'best konek, mauna,'"" she said in a separate message to reporters.
To date, the country's FDA has yet to issue an authorization to any brand of COVID-19 vaccine.
The Department of Health maintained that ""all vaccines should undergo the evaluation and regulatory process of our regulatory and expert bodies"" and warned that the use of unregistered products may pose harm to a person's health and safety.
""The administration of approved vaccines is also accompanied by strict monitoring of all vaccine recipients in order to ensure proper management of possible effects,"" it added.
FDA director general Eric Domingo also said that while recipients of unauthorized products may not be held liable, cases may be filed against those who import, distribute, and administer these drugs and vaccines without approval from the regulatory body.
""For the consumer, there's nothing we can do about it. It's a personal choice but it is illegal to import an unregistered product, and to distribute it, and for a doctor, medical practitioner or any health personnel to administer unlicensed drugs in the country. So, if we do catch any of them, we will be filing cases against them,"" he said. 
Republic Act 9711 or the “Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009” prohibits the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, promotion, advertising or sponsorship of health products without proper authorization from the FDA.
A person who violates this law may suffer the penalty of imprisonment ranging from one year but not more than 10 years, or a fine of not less than P50,000 but not more than P500,000, or both.

The companies, whose project relies on messenger RNA technology never before used in an approved vaccine, have dosed the first humans in Germany and hope to begin a US trial soon, pending regulators' blessing.
Pfizer, BioNtech and other companies are racing to develop a vaccine, since there are currently no approved treatments and only mixed results of medicines under study against the virus.
Britain's AstraZeneca said on Thursday it had joined with the University of Oxford on a vaccine project also being tested in volunteers.
Making millions of doses within just months, as Pfizer hopes, would mark almost unprecedented speed and require swift regulatory action.

""Of course we need to see and wait to see how the vaccine's efficacy and safety is demonstrated, hopefully in the coming months,"" Nanette Cocero, global head of Pfizer Vaccines, said on a call organised by Geneva-based industry group International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA).
""Assuming that is demonstrated, we are looking to ramp up manufacturing rather quickly to have around 10 to 20 million doses by the end of this year, which are expected to then of course be used in an emergency type of setting.""
Other drugmakers testing more than 70 COVID-19 vaccine candidates include Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and Novavax, and smaller projects like at Bern's Inselspital hospital in Switzerland.
SHOTS ON GOAL
Countries are risking billions on projects that may prove unsuccessful, out of desperation for a preventative treatment for a virus that has killed more than 200,000 people and lamed the global economy.
Merck Chief Patient Officer Julie Gerberding, a former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said many perils remain.
The novel coronavirus, still a mystery to scientists, may evolve, rendering an initially successful vaccine ineffective, she said.
""We have multiple shots on goal,"" said Gerberding. ""Most of them will not cross the finish line, but I'm really very optimistic that a few will.""
Questions also linger over who will get a vaccine first, with potentially painful allocation decisions inevitable.

Turkish researchers said on Thursday Sinovac's CoronaVac was 91.25% effective based on an interim analysis, only to see a confusing readout the same day from Brazil which said the vaccine's efficacy was between 50% and 90%.
Brazil has also delayed release of its efficacy data on the vaccine three times, as Sinovac seeks to consolidate data from global trials that include Indonesia, Turkey and Chile.
The efficacy data is closely watched as many developing countries have signed deals to use the Sinovac vaccine which is easier to store and transport than rival shots developed by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech and Moderna.
Experts say it's not unusual for a vaccine to show different efficacy rates in various settings, as trial protocols, data size and population could impact results, but the way CoronaVac data has been released created some confusion.

The Turkish trial data for CoronaVac is based on analysis of 1,322 participants which included 29 infected people, and efficacy evaluations were made 14 days after the second dose was administered.
Authorities initially planned to announce results when the number of patients reached 40, but released interim evaluation as the country looks to grant emergency use authorization.
Indonesia, which is also considering the shot for mass inoculation, confused the world earlier this month when state-owned Bio Farma said the vaccine's efficacy was 97%. It later clarified that the prevention rate could not be determined yet and it was necessary to wait for complete data.
""When you are not able to release sufficient details, it's probably better not to make your announcement like that,"" said Paul Griffin, a professor at the University of Queensland who is also running a number of COVID-19 vaccine studies.
With efficacy data in Turkey based on just 1,322 subjects and small infection cases, experts say more data from a larger number of participants would be needed to seek regulatory approval.
""It's difficult to determine how well [the] Sinovac vaccine works based solely on 29 coronavirus cases,"" Kim said.
""It would be good to have more volunteers and more infections, which would boost the robustness of the efficacy data.""
That would make data from Brazil crucial where it has completed a trial with 13,000 volunteers, while studies in Turkey and Indonesia involve more than 7,000 and 1,600 respectively.
Some experts warned greater scrutiny on data compilation and analysis was expected for COVID-19 vaccines developed in China due to its patchy safety track record.
""This should be analyzed very clearly and transparently. And transparency is one of the biggest concerns for China, especially with their vaccine and also because of their track record,"" said Dicky Budiman, an epidemiologist at Queensland’s Griffith University.
""So this is one of the very important and crucial times for China to show the world how they have improved the quality of their vaccines... This is something they have to explain to the world, through of course scientific papers."" — Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.9952999949455261,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['beijing', 'singapore', 'fragmental', 'release', 'efficacy', 'datum', 'develop', 'china', 'sinovac', 'undermine', 'confidence', 'shot', 'expert', 'warn', 'several', 'country', 'prepare', 'mass', 'inoculation', 'turkish', 'researcher', 'say', 'thursday', 'effective', 'base', 'see', 'confusing', 'readout', 'day', 'say', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'also', 'delay', 'release', 'efficacy', 'datum', 'time', 'sinovac', 'seek', 'consolidate', 'datum', 'global', 'trial', 'include', 'indonesia', 'turkey', 'chile', 'efficacy', 'datum', 'closely', 'watch', 'many', 'develop', 'country', 'sign', 'deal', 'use', 'sinovac', 'easy', 'store', 'transport', 'rival', 'shot', 'develop', 'pfizer', 'partner', 'moderna', 'expert', 'unusual', 'show', 'different', 'efficacy', 'rate', 'various', 'setting', 'trial', 'protocol', 'datum', 'size', 'population', 'impact', 'result', 'way', 'coronavac', 'datum', 'release', 'create', 'confusion', 'story', 'galvez', 'vaccine', 'astrazeneca', 'june', 'indonesian', 'president', 'jokowi', 'receive', 'countrys', 'first', 'shot', 'researcher', 'report', 'modest', 'efficacy', 'sinovac', 'really', 'want', 'datum', 'compelling', 'first', 'presentation', 'pfizer', 'moderna', 'achieve', 'astrazeneca', 'less', 'head', 'international', 'institute', 'seoul', 'base', 'non', 'profit', 'agency', 'devote', 'research', 'multiple', 'leak', 'datum', 'suggestion', 'do', 'see', 'effect', 'perhaps', 'final', 'presentation', 'january', 'compelling', 'sinovac', 'immediate', 'comment', 'chinese', 'foreign', 'ministry', 'spokesman', 'say', 'daily', 'briefing', 'developer', 'push', 'forward', 'strict', 'adherence', 'scientific', 'principle', 'regulatory', 'requirement', 'chinese', 'vaccine', 'sinopharm', 'cansino_biologic', 'chinese', 'academy', 'science', 'phase', 'clinical_trial', 'data', 'transparency', 'turkish', 'trial', 'datum', 'coronavac', 'base', 'analysis', 'participant', 'include', 'infected', 'people', 'efficacy', 'evaluation', 'make', 'day', 'second', 'dose', 'administer', 'authority', 'initially', 'plan', 'announce', 'result', 'number', 'patient', 'reach', 'release', 'interim', 'evaluation', 'country', 'look', 'grant', 'authorization', 'indonesia', 'also', 'consider', 'shoot', 'mass', 'inoculation', 'confuse', 'world', 'early', 'month', 'state_owne', 'farma', 'say', 'vaccine', 'efficacy', 'later', 'clarify', 'prevention', 'rate', 'determine', 'yet', 'necessary', 'wait', 'complete', 'datum', 'able', 'release', 'sufficient', 'detail', 'probably', 'well', 'make', 'announcement', 'say', 'professor', 'university', 'queensland', 'also', 'run', 'number', 'study', 'efficacy', 'datum', 'turkey', 'base', 'subject', 'small', 'infection', 'case', 'expert', 'data', 'large', 'number', 'participant', 'need', 'seek', 'regulatory', 'approval', 'difficult', 'determine', 'well', 'sinovac', 'work', 'base', 'solely', 'coronavirus', 'case', 'say', 'good', 'volunteer', 'infection', 'boost', 'robustness', 'efficacy', 'datum', 'make', 'datum', 'brazil', 'crucial', 'complete', 'trial', 'volunteer', 'study', 'turkey', 'indonesia', 'involve', 'respectively', 'expert', 'warn', 'great', 'scrutiny', 'datum', 'compilation', 'analysis', 'expect', 'vaccine', 'develop', 'china', 'due', 'patchy', 'safety', 'track', 'record', 'analyze', 'clearly', 'transparently', 'transparency', 'big', 'concern', 'china', 'especially', 'also', 'track', 'record', 'say', 'dicky', 'budiman', 'epidemiologist', 'queensland', 'griffith', 'university', 'important', 'crucial', 'time', 'china', 'show', 'world', 'improve', 'quality', 'vaccine', 'explain', 'world', 'course', 'scientific', 'paper', 'reuters']",0.9851,0.062,0.78,0.159,0.48993930905695615,Positive

""This is not part of the rollout, this is not part of the procurement of the government. This is just on their (PSG) own initiative so there's no connection or any apprehension about the distribution,"" Año said in an interview on ANC.
Año was reacting to the complaints of some frontline health workers regarding prioritization in connection with COVID-19 vaccines.
""The President has already laid out the guidelines on who are the priorities, the healthcare workers, the vulnerable, the indigent families and then the soldiers,"" he added.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo said they are looking into the vaccination of some soldiers and Cabinet officials against COVID-19 using an unregistered vaccine.

Año stressed that the use of unregistered vaccine is not a policy of the government.

Año, meanwhile, asked the public not to complicate the matter as he maintained that there is nothing illegal about the said vaccination. He also said only a ""handful of soldiers"" received the vaccine.
""Don't complicate things, just as simple as the soldiers protecting the masses would want to be inoculated and they're able to get some donation on it, and the country [that] provided it has an approved EUA (emergency use authorization). It's just simple, let's not complicate things,"" he said.

How long does it really take for a vaccine to be developed?
According to a report on GMA News Digital, it took scientists four years to develop a vaccine for the mumps virus, which is actually the fastest vaccine to have been developed in history.
In 1967, Maurice Hilleman developed the approved  mumps vaccine after four years of development from getting samples, approval, and finally to its licensing.
""Being optimistic, I think we will probably have some vaccine in 18 months from start, so probably sometime mid-next year. So 14 months from that, that would be a very optimistic view,"" said Dr. Lynda Stuart, tth director of vaccine research at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is the biggest charity helping scientists find a vaccine for COVID-19.
The development of a vaccine
In developing a vaccine, Stuart said there are two things to consider: speed and volume.
“So I think there are two problems that we face with vaccines for COVID-19. The first is clearly we would all like a vaccine very quickly. And so there is a question of speed. But the second question is a question of volume.” 
Stuart said speed of vaccine development and the volume of mass production must be balanced, since one without the other will not give the world the right solution.
""If we get a vaccine that's very fast, but we only can give it to 10 people that's not going to help us,"" Stuart explained.
""And if we get a vaccine that we can give to millions of people, but it takes us 10 years, that's also not the right solution,"" she added.
Stuart said for the planet to return to normalcy, a COVID-19 vaccine has to be developed.
“How long it will take us to get the first vaccine is very different from how long will it take us to get a vaccine that we can deploy to 7 billion people on the planet,"" Stuart said.
Although vaccine development has been a difficult challenge for science experts, a new technology and the unprecedented global collaboration within the scientific community can help speed up the process.
""The global scientific community has been quite remarkably collaborative... There are probably about 80 or so or between 80 and 100 labs that are beginning to work on this.”
“[To] get to this point would take us a couple of years. So the fact that we're here in a couple of months is, I think the important thing to know,"" she added.
It also helped that the genetic sequence of SARS-COV-2 or the virus that causes COVID-19 has also been released early.
According to the report, knowing the genetic sequence is important for experts to learn the characteristics of the virus including its behavior and weaknesses. This will help them produce vaccines and cure.
How does the vaccine work?
Professor Marilen Parungao who teaches microbiology at the University of the Philippines-Manila and who is also studying vaccinology explained how the vaccines work with an interesting metaphor: A by-invitation-only party, where the virus the gate crashers.
“Imagine there’s a by-invite only party. Those who don’t have an invitation will be stopped by the bouncer from entering. That’s how vaccines work in our body. They stop the gate crashers,"" she said.
“If a foreign body enters your system, your immune system will detect it and say, ‘You don’t belong here.’ Then, it will find a way to protect your body, in case the intruder does something harmful,"" she added.
""Have I seen him before? Have I met him before? What did I do when I met him? That’s how our immune system works.” 
The phases of vaccine development
Parungao said developing a vaccine is no easy and fast work since the experts need to allot time to study it thoroughly.
“It’s not like you can just develop vaccines in a snap. Like, when you wake up, there’s a vaccine already,"" Parungao said.
According to Parungao, development of vaccines goes through different phases before it gets approved and distributed to the public.
The first is the exploratory phase where experts study the virus to be able to devise the correct strategy to defeat it.
“It’s like what they are doing with COVID-19. They are studying its genome to know the characteristics of the virus,"" she said.
The second one is the pre-clinical phase, where laboratories check the effectiveness of the candidate vaccine.
“They will mimic the inner workings of the body and then try to determine the reaction of the cell,"" Parungao explained.
""For example, will this candidate vaccine create a molecule that will say, ‘hey, did you create antibodies or not?’ If that didn’t happen, that means the candidate vaccine is not effective. Next!” she added.
If the candidate vaccine passes the clinical phase, it will then be tested via clinical trial in humans where it will try to determine three things: immunogenicity, efficacy, and most importantly, safety.
“Are you familiar with allergies? When you inhale dust, for instance, and then you sneeze or get itchy, that means your body identifies the dust as a foreign intruder,"" Parungao explained. ""That is an immunogenic candidate. That’s good because your body recognizes it as something foreign.”
Effectiveness is the next thing to be determined or whether or not the candidate vaccine will produce anti-bodies to help beat a virus.
""You just don’t produce anti-bodies, it must help you clear the virus and cure you. That’s what we call efficacy.”
The most important element of vaccine development is safety.
Parungao said even if a candidate is effective but if it is proven unsafe, people can't use it and scientists have to go back to square one.
""This is what slows down the clinical trials. They would be in Phase 1 already of the trial and the candidate vaccine is not safe to use… They have to go back to square one,"" Parungao explained.
After experts declare a candidate vaccine's safety and efficacy, it will still be subjected to regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration or FDA.
Stuart said the experts are looking for ways to fast track it and have already started safety trials.
“The first safety trials I think started in March or April. So that's two or three months, rather than a year. So we're starting them really fast.”
Stuart said they are also starting to build the manufacturing capacity early to avoid a long period of waiting before it can be deliverable.
""And then we are also looking to do what we call at risk manufacturing scale-up. We know that once a vaccine works, we normally then have to build the factory that makes the vaccine,"" Stuart said.
""And so what we are doing is we're really trying to identify the ones that we think have promise and start building the manufacturing capacity early. So that if they work, we're not waiting a long period of time before the vaccine is actually deliverable in the billions of millions of doses.”
How much will it cost to make a vaccine?
According to the American Journal of Public Health, vaccine development costs US$200 million to US$500 million.
This is the reason why big pharmaceutical companies are mostly the ones capable of producing vaccines while independent scientists depend on monetary support from private institutions and the government.
Parungao said the best way to go about it is to fund the research and not offer a reward after producing one.
“Instead of telling people that they will get a reward for finding a vaccine, give them the money to actually start and fund the development process,"" she said.""That would be a better quotation, instead of giving the reward at the end. What is that anyway? A reimbursement?”
“Science is not like that. Science is funded from the basic to the applied,"" she continued.
Should the day come when the world finally has the COVID-19 vaccine, Parungao said there should be a discussion on who gets access to it and reassurance that the poor will also receive them as well.
“For example, if the Philippines get an allotment, will it be shouldered, say, by the Philhealth, because not everyone can afford a vaccine?” — Jannielyn Ann Bigtas/LA, GMA News",GMA

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/money/companies/769550/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-has-winning-formula-ceo/story/,AstraZeneca COVID vaccine has ‘winning formula’ —CEO,GMA News,2020-12-27 21:17:00,"LONDON — The COVID-19 vaccine developed by the British drugs group AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford has achieved a ""winning formula"" for efficacy, the company's chief executive said on Sunday.
The vaccine, currently being evaluated by Britain's independent medicines regulator, provides ""100 percent protection"" against severe COVID disease requiring hospitalization, Pascal Soriot said in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
He added he believes trials will show his firm has achieved a vaccine efficacy equal to Pfizer-BioNTech at 95 percent and Moderna at 94.5 percent.
“We think we have figured out the winning formula and how to get efficacy that, after two doses, is up there with everybody else,"" the chief executive said, while saying only that data would be published at ""some point.""
The UK government announced on December 23 that the developers of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had submitted their data to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Approval is expected to be granted permission to roll out the jab on January 4, The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reported.
The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first coronavirus shot to be authorized for use by the UK's independent medicines regulator and has been given to 600,000 of the country's most vulnerable people since last month.
Earlier trials had shown varying outcomes in the AstraZeneca shot's efficacy. The vaccine initially showed an average 70 percent effectiveness but that level jumped to 90 percent depending on dosage.
'Storm' over data
Behind this average figure from large-scale trials in the UK and Brazil was a 62 percent effectiveness for those who were vaccinated with two full doses of the shot.
For volunteers who received a half-dose first and then a full dose one month later, however, the vaccine was found to have 90 percent efficacy.
Soriot said he was ""surprised"" by the initial findings. ""We would have preferred a simpler set of results,"" he added.
The lack of clarity and transparency over the discrepancy in the results was widely criticized. Soriot said he had not expected the pushback that followed.
""We assumed people would be a bit disappointed, that’s for sure,"" he said. ""But we didn’t expect that storm.""
Great hopes have been placed in the AstraZeneca shot, originally based on a weakened version of a chimpanzee virus, because of its low cost.
AstraZeneca's vaccine also enjoys a logistical advantage over the Pfizer-BioNTech alternative, as it can be stored, transported and handled at normal refrigerated conditions of between two and eight degrees Celsius (36-46 Fahrenheit) for at least six months.
That is a far cry from the -70C needed for Pfizer/BioNTech's offering and could allow use of the existing refrigerated supply chain to cut costs.
'Light at the end of the tunnel'
In a vote of confidence for its homegrown vaccine, the bulk of Britain's requirements are expected to be met by the jab.
The government has ordered 100 million doses, with 40 million doses scheduled to be available by the end of March.
UK officials will hope that confidence is rewarded, not least because the country has been one of the countries most affected by the pandemic with more than 70,000 deaths.
A surge in cases has hit nationwide over the past week, falling especially on the southeast of England and blamed on a new strain of the virus believed to be more infectious, which was first identified in the UK.
According to one British study the strain is 50 percent to 74 percent more contagious.
In an effort to contain the spread of the disease, millions across Britain were placed under tougher lockdown restrictions that came into force on 26 December.
Dozens of countries have also imposed travel restrictions on the UK to stop the spread of the new strain.

Domingo made the remark after President Rodrigo Duterte on Saturday claimed that many Filipinos, including some members of the military, already had themselves inoculated with a COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm even as it has yet to get approval from the FDA.
“Kami po, pinapaalala po namin sa lahat na wala pa pong ina-approve ang FDA na vaccine dito sa atin,” Domingo said.
“Ibig pong sabihin, wala pa pong distributor na licensed na kumuha sa atin ng authorization at ‘yong mga alam natin na marunong mag-handle, mag-distribute at mag-dispense ng mga vaccine na ito ay wala pa po sa atin at this time kaya we really would like to advise everybody na mag-ingat po bago po sila magpa-inject ng kahit ano sa kanilang katawan ay hintayin na lang siguro nila ‘yong talagang government program ng immunization for COVID-19,” he added.
Domingo said the FDA is still investigating reports on unauthorized COVID-19 vaccinations but it has yet to arrest any individuals involved.

He said the Serum Institute of India assured it will not request a cash advance for the Philippines’ purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.
“‘Di po sila hihingi ng cash advance. Ibig sabihin, lahat po ng transaction natin magiging flexible. We will comply with your guidance na wala pong cash advance,” Galvez said.

PANTI,2020-11-25 12:50:00,"British firm AstraZeneca’s bid to conduct clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines is pushing through in the aftermath of impressive results of its clinical trials in the UK, the Department of Health said Wednesday.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire made the announcement two days after AstraZeneca announced that its joint COVID-19 vaccine effort with Oxford University showed that it could be as much as 90% effective.
“They first submitted documentary requirements to our Vaccine Experts Panel (VEP) last November 16, that time hindi pa kumpleto. Immediately, by November 18, they were able to complete all the documentary requirements so they are now for evaluation of the VEP and Ethics Review Board and other the rest of regulatory process for the clinical trial in the country,” Vergeire said.
After securing approval from VEP and Ethics Board, AstraZeneca would still have to get a green light from the Philippine Food and Drug Administration before it can proceed on its clinical trials here.
Vergeire earlier said it is best that COVID-19 vaccines manufactured abroad conduct clinical trials here since it would show how safe and effective the vaccine is for the Philippine population which is now a least 110 million.

AstraZeneca-Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine has been found 70% effective against COVID-19 at first half dose, but it increases to 90% after the second full dose is administered.
Likewise, AstraZeneca’s price range is cheaper at $3 to $4 compared with American firms Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech which COVID-19 vaccines proved also over 90% effective cost more due to the requirement of an ultra low freezer storage.
Vergeire, however, deferred comment on the query if AstaZeneca is the best option for the Philippines at this point despite these initial information.
“Kung sa practicality at kung ideal ba sa atin, antayin po natin ang pag-evaluate ng ating mga eksperto,” Vergeire said.
Vergeire said while the Philippines has yet to decide which COVID-19 vaccines to buy, government authorities are in talks with cold storage firms in the event that the country needs it for storing COVID-19 vaccines.
“Storage requirements would depend on logistical requirements of a specific vaccine. Once we have final list of vaccines na ating i-aangkat o ipo-procure, saka natin mafa-finalize ang pangangailangan. But we are preparing, nakikiapagusap na ang ating mga units at saka agencies,” she said.
“One of the alternatives na tinitignan…meron pong mga suppliers o kumpanya na nag-aalok na ho na iyong kanilang walk-in freezer which can be repurposed raw to be a -70 degrees Celsius ultra low storage [for COVID-19 vaccine]. Tinitignan natin iyang option na iyan kasi sinasabi nila that they can do this technology,” Vergeire added.
Vergeire also said that the government is also in talks with cold chain logistics companies that the authorities can tap to store COVID-19 vaccines if the need arises.
The Philippines has recorded 421,722 COVID-19 cases so far.

The trial is the first such late-stage study under the Trump administration's program to speed development of measures against the novel coronavirus, adding to hope that an effective vaccine will help end the pandemic. Shares of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna rose 9%.
Moderna has received nearly $1 billion from the US government, which is helping to bankroll several vaccine candidates under its Operation Warp Speed program.
More than 150 coronavirus vaccine candidates are in various stages of development, with some two dozen prospects having advanced to human testing.

Manufacturers are ramping up production while testing is underway in order to respond as soon as possible to virus, which is still spreading rapidly around the world. COVID-19 has killed more about 650,000 people worldwide and battered economies.
Moderna could have tens of millions of doses ready when and if the vaccine is deemed safe and effective, Collins told reporters on a call.
The large late-stage trial is designed to evaluate the safety of Moderna's mRNA-1273 vaccine and determine if it can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 after two doses.
Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease official, said a readout from the trial could come by November, December, or even earlier. Fauci said he was ""not particularly concerned"" about the vaccine's safety after seeing data from earlier, smaller trials.
The study also seeks to determine whether the vaccine can prevent coronavirus-related deaths.
Trial volunteers will receive two injections about 28 days apart of either 100 micrograms of mRNA-1273 or a placebo.
Results of a small early-stage study published earlier this month showed volunteers who got two doses of Moderna's vaccine had levels of virus-killing antibodies that exceeded the average seen in people who had recovered from COVID-19.
Moderna said it remains on track to deliver about 500 million doses a year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses a year, beginning 2021. — Reuters",GMA News,0.0,0.6086999773979187,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['moderna', 'inc', 'roll', 'end', 'year', 'official', 'say', 'announce', 'start', 'subject', 'trial', 'demonstrate', 'safe', 'effective', 'final', 'hurdle', 'prior', 'approval', 'global', 'regulator', 'trial', 'first', 'late_stage', 'study', 'trump', 'administration', 'program', 'speed', 'development', 'measure', 'add', 'hope', 'effective', 'help', 'end', 'pandemic', 'share', 'base', 'moderna', 'rise', 'moderna', 'receive', 'nearly', 'government', 'helping', 'bankroll', 'several', 'candidate', 'speed', 'program', 'coronavirus', 'candidate', 'various', 'stage', 'development', 'dozen', 'prospect', 'advanced', 'human', 'testing', 'safe', 'effective', 'distribute', 'end', 'stretch', 'goal', 'right', 'goal', 'american', 'people', 'national', 'institutes', 'health', 'nih', 'director', 'say', 'release', 'announce', 'start', 'large', 'phase', 'trial', 'story', 'reexamine', 'emergency', 'status', 'six_months', 'duterte', 'ask', 'congress', 'pass', 'law', 'nursing', 'education', 'medical', 'reserve', 'corps', 'extend', 'work', 'home', 'june', 'manufacturer', 'ramp', 'production', 'testing', 'underway', 'order', 'respond', 'soon', 'possible', 'virus', 'still', 'spread', 'rapidly', 'world', 'kill', 'people', 'worldwide', 'batter', 'economy', 'moderna', 'million', 'dose', 'ready', 'deem', 'safe', 'effective', 'collin', 'told_reporter', 'call', 'large', 'late_stage', 'trial', 'design', 'evaluate', 'safety', 'modernas', 'mrna', 'determine', 'prevent', 'symptomatic', 'dose', 'anthony_fauci', 'top', 'infectious', 'disease', 'official', 'say', 'readout', 'trial', 'come', 'november', 'even', 'early', 'fauci', 'say', 'particularly', 'concerned', 'vaccine', 'safety', 'see', 'datum', 'early', 'small', 'trial', 'study', 'also', 'seek', 'determine', 'prevent', 'coronavirus', 'relate', 'death', 'trial', 'volunteer', 'receive', 'injection', 'day', 'apart', 'microgram', 'placebo', 'result', 'small', 'early', 'stage', 'study', 'publish', 'early', 'month', 'show', 'volunteer', 'get', 'dose', 'level', 'virus', 'kill', 'antibody', 'exceed', 'average', 'see', 'people', 'recover', 'say', 'remain', 'track', 'deliver', 'dose', 'year', 'possibly', 'dose', 'year', 'begin', 'reuters']",0.9805,0.062,0.734,0.204,0.4597959183673471,Positive

The three vaccines, in order of stages of negotiations, are:
AztraZeneca from the United Kingdom; 
Sinovac from China; and
Pfizer from the US.

  Galvez said through the Food and Drug Administration, a memorandum of understanding can be signed with AstraZeneca as early as end of November, with the company committing at least 20 million doses.
The United Kingdom also gave assurance it will help the Philippines with the rollout of the vaccine by sending its soldiers. Rollout could be simultaneous with that of the United Kingdom. Earliest best case scenario is second quarter of next year.
AztraZeneca has reported up to 90% efficacy against COVID-19, Pfizer at 95%, while Sinovac is being used in China on an emergency basis.
From these three sources alone, Galvez said the Philippines could come up with 60 million vaccines that will be enough to trigger a herd immunity in the Philippines according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.
The Philippines is also in talks with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute and US’ Johnson and Johnson.
2. How soon can we get a vaccine? 
As early as second quarter of next year, according to Galvez.
The Philippines is in advance talks with AztraZeneca. A memorandum of understanding could be signed as early as end of November.
3. Who will get the vaccine? 
Galvez said individuals from areas that are highly infected by COVID-19 will be vaccinated first.
He mentioned the National Capital Region, Davao, Cebu, and Bacolod initially.
In these highly infected areas, people from the poorest of the poor under the 4Ps beneficiary list will be vaccinated first, followed by other sectors like healthcare workers, the police and the military.
Duterte emphasized the need to prioritize the military and the police, saying he needs them to be healthy. The police and the military along with barangay officials will help in the rollout of the vaccine.
The government has promised to vaccinate all Filipinos for free.
In previous “Talk to the Nation Addresses,” Galvez said big corporations are also making efforts to secure vaccines for their employees and donate a sizeable chunk to the government.
4. How much will the vaccines cost?
According to Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, the vaccines will cost about P73 billion.
He’s pegging it at $25 dollars per Filipino or at P1,200 per Filipino for 60 million Filipinos.
Vaccinating 60 million Filipinos is enough to trigger herd immunity, according to Duque, which is simply having more people immune to COVID-19 effectively slowing down if not cutting off transmission. —BAP/KG, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.9269999861717224,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['here', 'know', 'get', 'vaccine', 'vaccinate', 'first', 'much', 'cost', 'get', 'base', 'czar', 'force', 'chief', 'implementor', 'report', 'duterte', 'night', 'eye', 'least', 'vaccine', 'use', 'early', 'come', 'next_year', 'vaccine', 'order', 'stage', 'negotiation', 'aztrazeneca', 'united_kingdom', 'sinovac', 'china', 'pfizer', 'story', 'talk', 'astrazeneca', 'pfizer', 'sinovac', 'dose', 'vaccine', 'frontrunner', 'emerge', 'race', 'japans', 'raman', 'bar', 'struggle', 'stay', 'open', 'hammer', 'small', 'firm', 'galvez', 'say', 'food', 'memorandum', 'understand', 'sign', 'astrazeneca', 'early', 'end', 'november', 'company', 'commit', 'least', 'dose', 'united_kingdom', 'also', 'give', 'assurance', 'help', 'rollout', 'send', 'soldier', 'rollout', 'simultaneous', 'united_kingdom', 'early', 'scenario', 'second_quarter', 'aztrazeneca', 'report', 'efficacy', 'pfizer', 'use', 'china', 'emergency', 'basis', 'source', 'alone', 'galvez', 'say', 'come', 'vaccine', 'enough', 'trigger', 'accord', 'health', 'also', 'talk', 'russia', 'institute', 'soon', 'get', 'early', 'accord', 'galvez', 'advance', 'talk', 'aztrazeneca', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'sign', 'early', 'end', 'november', 'get', 'galvez', 'say', 'individual', 'area', 'highly', 'infect', 'vaccinate', 'first', 'mention', 'national', 'davao', 'cebu', 'bacolod', 'initially', 'highly', 'infect', 'area', 'people', 'poor', 'poor', 'ps', 'beneficiary', 'list', 'vaccinate', 'first', 'follow', 'sector', 'healthcare_worker', 'police', 'military', 'duterte', 'emphasize', 'need', 'prioritize', 'military', 'police', 'say', 'need', 'healthy', 'police', 'military', 'barangay', 'official', 'help', 'rollout', 'government', 'promise', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'free', 'previous', 'talk', 'nation', 'address', 'galvez', 'say', 'big', 'corporation', 'also', 'make', 'effort', 'secure', 'vaccine', 'employee', 'donate', 'sizeable', 'chunk', 'government', 'much', 'vaccine', 'cost', 'accord', 'finance', 'vaccine', 'cost', 'peg', 'dollar', 'filipino', 'filipino', 'filipino', 'vaccinate', 'filipino', 'enough', 'trigger', 'herd_immunity', 'accord', 'duque', 'simply', 'people', 'immune', 'effectively', 'slow', 'cut', 'transmission', 'bap', 'kg']",0.9136,0.063,0.816,0.12,0.39102453102453094,Positive

According to Dr. Jaime Montoya of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) on Friday, these vaccines are:
Sinovac from China
Janssen
Sputnik V from Russia
Clover Biopharmaceuticals
AstraZeneca
In order for a potential vaccine to conduct clinical trials in the country, it has to secure clearance from a panel of vaccine experts under DOST.
Once it is cleared by the DOST panel, it would also need approval from the Ethics Board and the Food and Drug Administration.

The Philippines' COVID-19 task force has formed a body that will handle the procurement, supply chain and logistics management, as well as distribution of vaccines especially to priority recipients.
The COVID-19 Vaccine Cluster is under Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the chief implementer of the government's pandemic response.
The government has earmarked P2.5 billion for COVID-19 vaccine procurement under the proposed 2021 national budget.
A recent Social Weather Stations survey shows that 66% of Filipinos are willing to get COVID-19 vaccine if it is available now. 
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the government is eyeing to give COVID-19 vaccine to around 50 million or 50% of the population on an initial basis.
She, however, conceded that the logistical cost of delivering the vaccine across the country could be more expensive than the vaccine itself, especially if the vaccine requires ultra-low freezer storage.  —KBK, GMA News",GMA News,4.0,0.9941999912261963,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['potential', 'vaccine', 'already', 'submit', 'possible', 'clinical_trial', 'accord', 'department', 'science', 'friday', 'vaccine', 'sinovac', 'china', 'janssen', 'sputnik', 'russia', 'clover', 'astrazeneca', 'order', 'potential', 'conduct', 'clinical_trial', 'country', 'secure', 'clearance', 'panel', 'expert', 'dost', 'clear', 'dost', 'panel', 'also', 'need', 'approval', 'food', 'drug_administration', 'story', 'galvez', 'say', 'good', 'info', 'drive', 'need', 'raise', 'public', 'awareness', 'govt', 'eye', 'initially', 'vaccinate', 'population', 'vergeire', 'back', 'gcq', 'palace', 'accord', 'health', 'undersecretary', 'clear', 'far', 'ini', 'evaluate', 'natin', 'ngayon', 'mukhang', 'kaunte', 'panahon', 'lang', 'naman', 'siguro', 'ibang', 'requirement', 'na', 'hinihingi', 'natin', 'para', 'approve', 'ang', 'clinical', 'trial', 'say', 'public', 'briefing', 'thursday', 'form', 'body', 'handle', 'procurement', 'supply', 'chain', 'logistic', 'management', 'well', 'distribution', 'vaccine', 'especially', 'priority', 'recipient', 'cluster', 'secretary_carlito', 'government', 'pandemic', 'response', 'government', 'earmark', 'procurement', 'propose', 'national', 'budget', 'recent', 'social_weather', 'station', 'survey', 'show', 'filipino', 'willing', 'get', 'available', 'health', 'rosario_vergeire', 'say', 'government', 'eye', 'give', 'around', 'population', 'initial', 'basis', 'however', 'concede', 'logistical', 'cost', 'deliver', 'country', 'expensive', 'especially', 'require', 'freezer', 'storage', 'kbk']",0.9287,0.0,0.895,0.105,0.5368421052631579,Positive

PANTI,2020-12-16 11:02:00,"A COVID-19 vaccine must be 60% to 70% effective to be able to secure approval from the Philippines’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Director General Eric Domingo of FDA said. 
“Generally, it should be 60% to 70% effective. That is the minimum requirement,” Domingo said in an ANC interview.
“Most vaccines pass [FDA regulation] if they have 60% to 70% efficacy rate. But of course, the higher [percentage of efficacy rate], the better,” Domingo added.
President Rodrigo Duterte has already issued an executive order allowing FDA to issue emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines which it will find safe and effective. 
Only COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca-Oxford have been proven at least 80% effective after human trials.

However, only the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer-BioNTech have secured EUA from regulatory bodies of the United States, United Kingdom and Canada. 
With EUA issuance of reputable regulatory bodies limited to Pfizer, Domingo said that it is understandable that the supply is scarce. 
“It takes some time kasi wala pa ring EUA ang iba, so the production is not yet enough to be able to supply it here immediately,” Domingo pointed out. 
Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said that COVID-19 vaccine supply from Western companies like American firm Pfizer are only due to arrive in the Philippines by third quarter of 2021. This is because most of the supply were already secured by Western countries like the United States, United Kingdom and European Union. 
Galvez said the Philippines is eyeing to secure 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Chinese firm Sinovac by March 2021.
Sinovac, however, has yet to release the results of the Phase 3 of its clinical trials or the human trials. 
Domingo, however, assured the public that no COVID-19 vaccine will be administered in the country unless it passes FDA scrutiny which includes evaluation of results on human clinical trials. 
“Hindi sila makakapasok unless ito ay safe and effective,” Domingo said.
The Philippines has already secured 2.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca-Oxford—an initiative funded by the private sector for donation to the Philippines government.

Secretary Carlito Galvez, the chairman of the national task force for COVID-19 response, made the remark after President Rodrigo Duterte asked in a briefing when the first vaccine will be given to Filipinos.
“Eighty percent po ang nakuha ng mga malalaking bansa. Ngayon po nakita namin pinaka-earliest [vaccination] is mga March, nine-negotiate po namin sa ambassador ng China,” he said.
The bulk of the vaccines would likely arrive in May, June, and July 2021 if negotiations with manufacturers AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Sinovac prove fruitful, Galvez added.
“Sa first quarter, ito po ang tinatawag nating ‘mini rollout.’ Tama lang sa first quarter po, makita natin ‘yung rollout ng ibang bansa para matuto tayo sa kanilang experience,” he said.
Food and Drug Administration chief Eric Domingo earlier said there was a chance that a COVID-19 vaccine would be rolled out in March next year following positive developments abroad.
The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and Singapore have authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for emergency use after it showed 95 percent efficacy.
Galvez said this would help speed up the approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the Philippines as well.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier clarified that the Philippines’ talks with Pfizer were still underway after he was accused of “dropping the ball” during negotiations that allegedly led to a delay in the delivery of 10 million doses.
Meanwhile, Galvez said vaccine experts were studying the performance of China’s Sinovac vaccine and Russia’s Sputnik V.
Sinovac was earlier accused of engaging in bribery to hasten the approval of its vaccines.

""This is important because we want to test for efficacy of the vaccine and we will do it in phases where there is a high occurrence or attack rate,"" Dela Peña said.
""If WHO will release the list of vaccines and protocols by October, that is the only time that we can start recruiting patients,"" he added.
The DOST is in the process of finalizing the memorandum of agreement between the DOST and Department of the Interior and Local Government for the conduct and zoning of the clinical trials, according to Dela Peña.
'17 other bilateral partners'
Aside from participating in the WHO Solidarity Trial, the Philippines also entered into bilateral agreements with 17 other COVID-19 vaccine developers from China, US, Taiwan, Japan, Australia, Russia, and India.
""We're approaching these countries to find out what is the status of their vaccine and whether they are willing to enter into partnership with us in one form or another either through trials or through manufacture in our country,"" Dela Peña said.
The Philippine government has so far signed confidentiality data agreements (CDA) with six foreign pharmaceutical companies.
Gamaleya Research Institute from Russia and Sinovac from China are both interested to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials and venture into local manufacturing of their products in the Philippines, Dela Peña said.
He added that three others—ZFSW from China, The University of Queensland from Australia, and Adimmue from Chinese Taipei have also signified interest to conduct clinical trials in the country.
Another one from China, Sinopharm, is also interested in supplying their products to the Philippines.
To date, no clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine have started yet in the country, the DOST chief said.
As of September 24, the FDA said it has not received any application yet for Phase 3 clinical trials.
""Wala pang umaabot sa FDA na application for a clinical trial for a COVID-19 vaccine. They are still with the vaccine expert panel. I think they are still completing documents. So officially, wala pang na-e-endorse sa FDA,"" Domingo said. 
On the other hand, the application for a certificate of product registration in the FDA after the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials would take around 45 to 60 days, depending if the vaccine is already pre-qualified by the WHO or FDA counterparts in other countries.
""This is not limited to vaccines that will undergo clinical trial Phase 3 here.

Together with Pfizer Inc's vaccine, also shown to be more than 90% effective, and pending more safety data and regulatory review, the United States could have two vaccines authorized for emergency use in December with as many as 60 million doses of vaccine available by the year's end.
Next year, the U.S. government could have access to more than 1 billion doses just from the two vaccine makers, more than needed for the country's 330 million residents.
The vaccines, both built using new technology known as messenger RNA or mRNA, represent powerful new tools to fight a pandemic that has infected 54 million people worldwide and killed 1.3 million. The news also comes at time when COVID-19 cases are soaring, hitting new records in the United States and pushing some European countries back into lockdowns.
""We are going to have a vaccine that can stop COVID-19,"" Moderna President Stephen Hoge said in a telephone interview.

Moderna's interim analysis was based on 95 infections among trial participants who received either a placebo or the vaccine. Of those, only five infections occurred in those who received the vaccine, which is administered in two shots 28 days apart.
A key advantage of Moderna's vaccine is that it does not need ultra-cold storage like Pfizer's, making it easier to distribute. Moderna expects it to be stable at standard refrigerator temperatures of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 48°F) for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20 degrees Celsius.
Pfizer’s vaccine must be shipped and stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, the sort of temperature typical of an Antarctic winter. At standard refrigerator temperatures, it can be stored for up to five days.
The data from Moderna's 30,000 participant-strong trial also showed the vaccine prevented cases of severe COVID-19, a question that still remains with the Pfizer vaccine. Of the 95 cases in Moderna's trial, 11 were severe and all 11 occurred among volunteers who got the placebo.
Moderna, part of the U.S. government's Operation Warp Speed program, expects to produce around 20 million doses of the vaccine for the United States this year, millions of which the company has already made, and is ready to ship if it receives FDA authorization.
""Assuming we get an emergency use authorization, we'll be ready to ship through Warp Speed almost in hours,"" Hoge said. ""So it could start being distributed instantly.""
Data details
The 95 cases of COVID-19 included several key groups who are at increased risk for severe disease, including 15 cases in adults aged 65 and older and 20 in participants from racially diverse groups.
Most side effects were mild to moderate. A significant proportion of volunteers, however, experienced more severe aches and pains after taking the second dose, including about 10% who had fatigue severe enough to interfere with daily activities while another 9% had severe body aches. Most of these complaints were generally short-lived, the company said.
Moderna's data provide further validation of the promising but previously unproven mRNA platform, which turns the human body into a vaccine factory by coaxing cells to make certain virus proteins that the immune system sees as a threat and mounts a response against.
Moderna expects to have enough safety data required for U.S. authorization in the next week or so and the company expects to file for emergency use authorization in the coming weeks.
The United States has the world's highest known number of COVID-19 cases and deaths with more than 11 million infections and nearly 250,000 deaths.
The Trump Administration has primarily relied on development of vaccines and treatments as its response to the pandemic. Moderna has received nearly $1 billion in research and development funding from the U.S. government and has a $1.5 billion deal for 100 million doses. The U.S. government also has an option for another 400 million doses.
The company hopes to have between 500 million and 1 billion doses in 2021, split between its U.S. and international manufacturing sites and dependent in part on demand.
The U.S. government has said COVID-19 vaccines will be provided free to Americans, whether they have health insurance, are uninsured or are covered by government health programs such as Medicare.
Moderna also said it will use its data to seek authorization in Europe and other regions.
Other countries such as China and Russia have already begun vaccinations. Russia licensed its “Sputnik-V” COVID-19 vaccine for domestic use in August before it released data from large-scale trials. It said on Nov. 11 that its vaccine was 92% effective based on 20 infections in its large trial. -Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.4708000123500824,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['moderna', 'say', 'monday', 'experimental', 'effective', 'prevent', 'base', 'interim', 'datum', 'late_stage', 'clinical', 'trial', 'become', 'second', 'company', 'week', 'report', 'result', 'far', 'exceed', 'expectation', 'together', 'pfizer', 'inc', 'also', 'show', 'effective', 'pende', 'safety', 'datum', 'regulatory', 'review', 'united_state', 'vaccine', 'authorize', 'december', 'many', 'dose', 'available', 'year', 'end', 'next_year', 'government', 'access', 'dose', 'maker', 'need', 'country', 'resident', 'vaccine', 'build', 'use', 'new', 'technology', 'know', 'mrna', 'represent', 'powerful', 'new', 'tool', 'fight', 'pandemic', 'infect', 'people', 'worldwide', 'kill', 'also', 'come', 'time', 'case', 'soar', 'hit', 'new', 'record', 'push', 'european', 'country', 'back', 'lockdown', 'go', 'stop', 'moderna', 'president', 'say', 'telephone', 'interview', 'story', 'marikina', 'lawmaker', 'quimbo', 'bat', 'bayanihan', 'aid', 'law', 'duterte', 'order', 'release', 'hazard', 'duty', 'pay', 'special', 'risk', 'allowance', 'health', 'worker', 'house', 'adopt', 'measure', 'urge', 'duterte', 'allow', 'face', 'face_classe', 'base', 'infection', 'trial', 'participant', 'receive', 'placebo', 'infection', 'occur', 'receive', 'administer', 'shot', 'day', 'apart', 'key', 'advantage', 'modernas', 'need', 'ultra', 'cold_storage', 'pfizer', 'make', 'easy', 'distribute', 'moderna', 'expect', 'stable', 'standard', 'refrigerator', 'temperature', 'day', 'store', 'month', 'pfizer', 'ship', 'store', 'sort', 'temperature', 'typical', 'antarctic', 'winter', 'standard', 'refrigerator', 'temperature', 'store', 'day', 'datum', 'participant', 'strong', 'trial', 'also', 'show', 'prevent', 'case', 'severe', 'question', 'still', 'remain', 'pfizer', 'case', 'modernas', 'trial', 'severe', 'occur', 'volunteer', 'get', 'placebo', 'moderna', 'part', 'government', 'speed', 'program', 'expect', 'produce', 'dose', 'united_state', 'year', 'million', 'company', 'already', 'make', 'ready', 'ship', 'receive', 'fda', 'authorization', 'assume', 'get', 'authorization', 'well', 'ready', 'ship', 'almost', 'hour', 'say', 'start', 'distribute', 'instantly', 'datum', 'detail', 'case', 'include', 'several', 'key', 'group', 'increase', 'risk', 'severe', 'disease', 'include', 'case', 'adult', 'age', 'old', 'participant', 'racially', 'diverse', 'group', 'side_effect', 'mild', 'moderate', 'significant', 'proportion', 'volunteer', 'however', 'experience', 'severe', 'ache', 'pain', 'take', 'second', 'dose', 'include', 'fatigue', 'severe', 'enough', 'interfere', 'daily', 'activity', 'severe', 'body', 'ache', 'complaint', 'generally', 'short', 'live', 'company', 'say', 'datum', 'provide', 'validation', 'promise', 'previously', 'unproven', 'mrna', 'platform', 'turn', 'human', 'body', 'factory', 'coax', 'cell', 'make', 'certain', 'virus', 'protein', 'see', 'threat', 'mount', 'response', 'moderna', 'expect', 'enough', 'safety', 'datum', 'require', 'authorization', 'next', 'week', 'company', 'expect', 'file', 'authorization', 'come', 'week', 'united_state', 'world', 'highest', 'know', 'number', 'case', 'death', 'infection', 'nearly', 'death', 'trump', 'administration', 'primarily', 'rely', 'development', 'vaccine', 'treatment', 'response', 'pandemic', 'moderna', 'receive', 'nearly', 'research', 'development', 'funding', 'government', 'deal', 'dose', 'government', 'also', 'option', 'dose', 'company', 'hope', 'dose', 'split', 'international', 'manufacture', 'site', 'dependent', 'part', 'demand', 'government', 'say', 'vaccine', 'provide', 'free', 'american', 'health', 'insurance', 'uninsured', 'cover', 'government', 'health', 'program', 'medicare', 'also', 'say', 'use', 'datum', 'seek', 'authorization', 'europe', 'region', 'country', 'china', 'russia', 'already', 'begin', 'vaccination', 'russia', 'license', 'sputnik', 'domestic', 'use', 'august', 'release', 'datum', 'large_scale', 'trial', 'say', 'nov', 'effective', 'base', 'infection', 'large', 'trial', 'reuters']",-0.1027,0.123,0.745,0.131,0.46056726292575356,Negative

Approved by the task force on Thursday, the COVID-19 Vaccine Cluster is under Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the chief implementer of the government’s pandemic response, according to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.
Roque said President Rodrigo Duterte’s designation of Galvez as the “vaccine czar” effectively abolished the COVID-19 Immunization Program Management Organizational Structure headed by the Department of Health.
Aside from procurement and distribution of the vaccines, Galvez will also supervise the vaccine risk communication and social preparation, act as spokesperson for vaccine matters, and enter into an agreement with a third party warehouse and logistics provider, as necessary.
He must also facilitate consensus on prioritization of vaccine recipients, develop protocol on accessing vaccines and facilitate the early issuance of the Certificate of Product Registration for the vaccines with the Food and Drug Administration, among other tasks.

Jhon Maurice Peñas, a Filipino nurse working in a dialysis center, shared the relief at hearing that the vaccine will be available to all Singapore residents and that frontline workers like him will get the vaccine sooner. 
“Masaya ako sa pagluluwag ng restrictions, lalo na sa mag-aallocate nila ng vaccines at uunahin ang  mga frontliners na kagaya ko pati mga elderly persons na in need ng mga vaccine na 'yun.” 
“Nagpapasalamat ako sa government ng Singapore na kahit ako ay isang foreigner na nagtatrabaho dito eh mabibigyan pa din ako at libre pa 'yung ibibigay nila sa akin. Hindi lang siya exclusive sa mga citizens ng Singapore kundi sa mga katulad ko din na nagtatrabaho dito sa Singapore” Peñas said. 
Singapore expects the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of December and will start vaccinating Singaporean citizens and long-term pass holders for free, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced on Monday.

“The first shipment should arrive by the end of this month, making Singapore one of the first countries to obtain this vaccine. […] If all goes according to plan, we will have enough vaccines for everyone in Singapore by the third quarter of 2021,” Lee said. 
More than 200,000 Filipinos currently residing in Singapore may be able to receive the vaccine.  
“We have decided to make vaccinations free for all Singaporeans and for all long-term residents who are currently here. I strongly encourage you to get vaccinated too, because when you get yourself vaccinated, you are not just protecting yourself, you are also doing your part to protect others, especially your loved ones,” Lee added. 
Lee also announced that restrictions will loosen up and Singapore will enter Phase 3 of the country’s safe reopening starting December 28. This would allow the holding of gatherings of more people from five to eight, and the opening of some public events with safe measures, among others.
This is also welcome news for the Philippine Embassy in Singapore. According to First Secretary and Consul for Political and Cultural Affairs Gonaranao B. Musor, they are happy that Singapore will soon implement Phase 3 of the lifting of circuit breaker measures and provision of free vaccination.   
“We are thankful that many Filipino legal residents and work pass holders in Singapore will benefit from this free vaccination. The Philippines continues to be grateful for the assistance that Singapore has generously provided for Philippines’ COVID-19 response,” Musor shared. 
According to the Philippine Embassy, in Singapore’s December 14 update, a total of 392 Filipinos have contracted COVID-19 in Singapore since the start of the pandemic, of whom 99% (or 389) have recovered.
The two most recent Filipino cases were imported cases who arrived in Singapore from the Philippines on December 12 and 13, both work-permit holders according to the data from the Ministry of Health (MOH).   
There were five imported cases and no local transmission, based on MOH’s December 14 update, bringing the total number of cases in Singapore to 58,325, of whom 99.8% (58,210) have recovered. Only 86 cases are active (0.15%). The death toll is at 29 (0.05%).
Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority (HSA), the national authority that regulates health products, approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for pandemic use after studying the scientific evidence and clinical trial data, according to Lee. 
 
The administration of the vaccine will be strongly encouraged for those 16 years old and older but will be voluntary.

In a press conference, Guevara said the country will have access to the vaccine by the fourth quarter of this year but only for clinical trials.
“If we’re talking about the availability en masse, we believe this is going to happen in the second quarter of next year,” Guevara said.
“But if we're talking about the clinical trials, it will start in the fourth quarter of this year.”
Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of DOST Philippine Council for Health Research Development, said the timeline heading to the availability of the vaccine will depend on the country of the vaccine's developer.
According to him, the timeline will start when the vaccine is already approved by its country of origin. For instance, Montoya said Russia, which claimed to be the first country to develop a vaccine against COVID-19, is planning to start the clinical trial involving other countries in September.
He said the process will take six months to finish, after which the results will be gathered, and then the Food and Drugs Administration in Russia will review them for a month.
When the FDA in Russia approved the vaccine, approval from the FDA in other countries will then be sought.
At the start of the second quarter of 2021, the FDA Philippines will review the vaccine for a month. If the results are good, the FDA will approve the vaccine.
By the end of the second quarter of 2021, the vaccine will be available  for market and use, Montoya said.
Philippines’ representative to the World Health Organization’s Solidarity Trials for COVID-19, Dr. Lina Gloriani, said the Russia-developed vaccine Sputnik V released only limited information.
According to her, the following developers are on the top of the list being considered to be part of the solidarity trial, which are  all currently under Phase 3:
Oxford-AstraZeneca
Sinovac
Sinopharm (two vaccines under development)
Moderna
Pfizer
“Meron pang iba pero nasa Phase 2 pa lang sila. But I think eventually, they will move to Phase 3. So, hindi natin alam sino doon yung isasali sa WHO Solidarity Trial,” Gloriani said.
“Right now, ‘yun po ang nakakausap natin,” she added.
FDA general director Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo explained that the Phase 1, 2, and Phase 3 of vaccine trials test the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.
After the Phase 3 trial, Domingo said vaccines can be distributed to market.
Citing information from a meeting with WHO, Domingo earlier said that there were doubts on how Russia jumped to the approval of the COVID-19 vaccine.
“Ang huling update natin ay sa Russia mukhang nasa Phase 2 clinical trial pa lamang at patapos pa lamang. Kaya siguro nagulat din ang buong mundo na biglang kine-claim nila na approved na,” he said.
""Hindi natin alam kung ano 'yung approval process na nangyari sa Russia or baka talagang nag-approve na sila after Phase 2 o kung talagang na-complete nila 'yung Phase 3,’ he added.
Domingo said the FDA will get more information about the approval of the Sputnik V vaccine. —KBK, GMA News",GMA News,1.0,0.9965999722480774,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['available', 'public', 'country', 'department', 'science', 'undersecretary', 'guevara', 'say', 'wednesday', 'guevara', 'say', 'country', 'access', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'year', 'clinical_trial', 'talk', 'availability', 'masse', 'believe', 'go', 'happen', 'second_quarter', 'guevara', 'say', 'talk', 'clinical_trial', 'start', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'year', 'executive', 'director', 'dost', 'council', 'health', 'research', 'development', 'say', 'timeline', 'head', 'availability', 'depend', 'country', 'vaccine', 'developer', 'accord', 'timeline', 'start', 'already', 'approve', 'country', 'origin', 'instance', 'say', 'russia', 'claim', 'first', 'country', 'develop', 'plan', 'start', 'clinical', 'trial', 'involve', 'country', 'say', 'process', 'take', 'six_months', 'finish', 'result', 'gather', 'food', 'drug', 'administration', 'russia', 'review', 'month', 'russia', 'approve', 'approval', 'fda', 'country', 'seek', 'start', 'review', 'month', 'result', 'good', 'approve', 'end', 'second_quarter', 'available', 'market', 'use', 'montoya', 'say', 'representative', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'solidarity', 'trial', 'dr', 'lina', 'say', 'russia', 'develop', 'sputnik', 'release', 'limited', 'information', 'accord', 'follow', 'developer', 'top', 'list', 'consider', 'part', 'solidarity_trial', 'currently', 'phase', 'astrazeneca', 'sinovac', 'sinopharm', 'vaccine', 'development', 'moderna', 'pfizer', 'meron', 'pang', 'iba', 'nasa', 'phase', 'lang', 'sila', 'think', 'eventually', 'move', 'phase', 'hindi', 'natin', 'sino', 'doon', 'yung', 'gloriani', 'say', 'right', 'yun', 'po', 'ang', 'natin', 'add', 'fda', 'general', 'director', 'health', 'undersecretary', 'explain', 'phase', 'phase', 'trial', 'test', 'safety', 'effectiveness', 'vaccine', 'phase', 'trial', 'domingo', 'say', 'vaccine', 'distribute', 'market', 'cite', 'information', 'meeting', 'domingo', 'early', 'say', 'doubt', 'russia', 'jump', 'approval', 'ang', 'huling', 'update', 'natin', 'russia', 'mukhang', 'nasa', 'phase', 'clinical', 'trial', 'patapos', 'kaya', 'siguro', 'nagulat', 'din', 'ang', 'buong', 'mundo', 'na', 'kine', 'claim', 'nila', 'approve', 'na', 'say', 'hindi', 'natin', 'alam', 'yung', 'approval', 'process', 'na', 'russia', 'baka', 'talagang', 'nag', 'approve', 'sila', 'phase', 'kung', 'talagang', 'complete', 'yung', 'phase', 'add', 'domingo', 'say', 'fda', 'get', 'information', 'approval', 'sputnik', 'kbk']",0.891,0.041,0.874,0.085,0.32704081632653065,Positive
https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/healthandwellness/763865/reuters-journalist-explains-why-he-volunteered-for-covid-19-vaccine-trial/story/,Reuters journalist explains why he volunteered for COVID-19 vaccine trial,STEVE STECKLOW,2020-11-12 16:19:00,"LONDON — So why did I volunteer to be injected with an experimental vaccine for COVID-19? That's what some of my friends wanted to know when I told them what I was doing.
""Who knows about the long term,"" texted a former college roommate. ""Seems like a gamble.""
It all began in July when the British government announced it was seeking lots of volunteers for large-scale clinical trials of new vaccines. Only a month before, a good friend of mine here had died of COVID-19 after spending weeks on a ventilator.
Curious, I completed an online form, figuring I wasn't committing myself to anything.
In late September, an email informed me that I was among more than 250,000 ""pioneers in the fight against COVID-19"" who had enlisted in the cause. On Oct. 1, I was invited to apply for a trial of a vaccine made by an American biotech company called Novavax Inc. It was seeking at the time up to 10,000 volunteers in the United Kingdom for a late-stage trial to determine the vaccine's safety and effectiveness.

Duterte to ASEAN: Prioritize health security
""If you are aged 18-84 and in good health, you could be eligible to participate,"" the email stated. ""The study involves six visits over a period of around 13 months. Reasonable travel expenses will be reimbursed.""
Now, it was time to decide. I began researching the Novavax vaccine, which has received less attention than several others. On Monday, Pfizer Inc announced its COVID-19 vaccine candidate appeared to be more than 90% effective. In September, late-stage trials of a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc were halted after a report of a serious neurological illness in a volunteer, although the trials later were permitted to resume.
To me, the Novavax vaccine seemed less risky. Although the Maryland-based company has never received approval for a vaccine, it's employing the same technology to create its COVID-19 candidate that it used with a promising flu shot. I've gotten inoculated against the flu every year for decades and never once had an adverse reaction.
The published results of the first phase of testing the Novavax vaccine also showed no serious side effects among more than 100 participants who were injected with it. The worst case was someone who had a mild fever for a day.
I decided to go for it. I figured if life is ever going to return to normal, the world is going to need vaccines and volunteers to see if they work. On a selfish level, I liked the idea of getting inoculated as soon as possible, given how monotonous—and sometimes scary—my daily routine had become. I've become so risk-averse that my wife has called me her ""jailer.""
Another attraction: If I were to catch the virus, the researchers would carefully monitor me. In the UK, where there has been a surge in new COVID-19 cases to more than 20,000 a day, infected people essentially are on their own unless they require emergency care.
Of course, there was a 50-50 chance I would be injected with a placebo—a saline solution—that wouldn't protect me against anything. In testing vaccines, placebos are used as a control to see whether the real thing is more effective at fending off the virus.
And so, after an online and over-the-phone screening to determine if I had any medical conditions that disqualified me from the study, I was given an appointment for the first of two injections.
I showed up one recent morning at the clinical research facility at King's College Hospital in south London—a small, drab building that is part of a sprawling medical complex. To my surprise, the receptionist asked me to take off my ""Churchill Pro"" bike mask—which costs $33 and uses ""British Military Filtration Technology"" to block ""almost 100%"" of viruses—and replace it with a cheap, disposable one. I later learned this was because my super-duper mask potentially could be contaminated.
Several other volunteers were already in a large room getting set up. I met privately with a doctor who asked if I had any questions. I had a few: ""What if the Novavax vaccine proved so successful that the trial was stopped? Would I be told whether I received the placebo and, if so, be given the real vaccine?"" The doctor told me that if I had gotten the placebo, I would have to wait a year, since the researchers would want to keep monitoring every trial participant. Not what I wanted to hear.
""What if another vaccine is approved first and I was given the placebo? Would I be allowed to take that?"" The doctor suggested that was possible.
After I signed a consent form to participate in the trial, she gave me a brief physical exam. Back in the large room, a nurse gave me a COVID-19 test, sticking a long swab up my throat and then through a nostril. Then he prepared to draw my blood. I warned him my veins were thin and often proved problematic. He proceeded to fail twice before calling over a colleague who had better luck.
The injection itself was uneventful. But when the nurse checked my blood pressure afterward, it had spiked. He asked me to wait a few minutes and basically calm down. I thought about the meditation exercises I had always scoffed at but had recently tried to reduce pandemic-induced anxiety—breathe in, breathe out. It worked.
So far, I've experienced no side effects and am awaiting a second injection once three weeks have passed. Curious about my experience, I spoke to James Galloway, a senior clinical lecturer at King's College who is the doctor responsible for my trial.
He told me that no decisions have been made on what to do with volunteers who received the placebo if Novavax is shown to be effective or another vaccine is approved first. He later added, ""If we get another vaccine that works, we'd want people to get that vaccine if they've had the placebo.""
""We don't want anyone to suffer from participating in the study,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for Novavax later told me volunteers would discuss their options with the clinicians overseeing the trial sites.
Galloway said there's a theoretical risk if someone who got the Novavax vaccine is injected with a different one. ""There's a chance you'd have a reaction.""
He doesn't know how the UK Novavax trial is going so far because he doesn't have access to the data. But overall, he remains optimistic that effective vaccines against COVID-19 will arrive.

CABUENAS,2020-12-15 18:43:00,"The availability of vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), along with other factors, is expected to create a ""market euphoria"" in the real estate sector next year, following the drop caused by the pandemic in 2020.
According to Leechiu Property Consultants (LPC), a rollout of the vaccine will boost the growth of the industry next year with increased activity in several sectors such as retail.
""We have every confidence that the rollout of the vaccine in 2021 will create unprecedented market euphoria that will dramatically benefit the real estate industry,"" LPC chief executive officer David Leechiu said in a virtual briefing on Tuesday.
""A confluence of factors – from record-low, long-term interest rates, to the country’s fantastic fiscal fundamentals that have resulted in good credit ratings, to newfound mobility and tourism opportunities from a massive injection of infrastructure projects– will ensure that,"" he added.
Earlier this week, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said talks on procurement of the vaccines are ongoing and are being sped up, but contracts are likely to be signed by January 2021.

Data released by LPC showed that the retail sector is already showing signs of increasing activity, as sales have bounced back to 47% - 75% of sales in pre-pandemic times during the third quarter of the year.
This comes even as vacated spaces were recorded at 540,000 square meters in the fourth quarter, with 51% or 277,000 square meters attributable to Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) and 33% or 179,000 square meters from other players struggling to recover from COVID-19 losses.
Still, LPC said rents are holding up owing to the presence of information technology-business process management (IT-BPM) firms and multinationals that would take over PEZA-accredited spaces from POGOs.
""Developments in the last two quarters have created compelling opportunities for IT-BPM players. We are thus confident that they will continue expanding in the country which remains a leading outsourcing arena for global businesses now seeking to cut costs and recover from COVID losses,"" Leechiu said.—LDF, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.9957000017166138,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['availability', 'vaccine', 'coronavirus', 'disease', 'factor', 'expect', 'create', 'market', 'euphoria', 'real', 'estate', 'sector', 'follow', 'drop', 'cause', 'pandemic', 'accord', 'leechiu', 'property', 'consultant', 'lpc', 'rollout', 'boost', 'growth', 'industry', 'increase', 'activity', 'several', 'sector', 'retail', 'confidence', 'rollout', 'create', 'unprecedented', 'market', 'euphoria', 'dramatically', 'benefit', 'real', 'estate', 'industry', 'lpc', 'officer', 'leechiu', 'say', 'virtual_briefing', 'tuesday', 'confluence', 'factor', 'record', 'low', 'long_term', 'interest', 'rate', 'country', 'fantastic', 'fiscal', 'fundamental', 'result', 'good', 'credit', 'rating', 'newfound', 'mobility', 'tourism', 'opportunity', 'massive', 'injection', 'infrastructure', 'project', 'ensure', 'add', 'early', 'week', 'say', 'talk', 'procurement', 'vaccine', 'ongoing', 'speed', 'contract', 'likely', 'sign', 'january', 'story', 'property', 'sector', 'metro', 'weaken', 'school', 'ready', 'face', 'face_classe', 'pandemic', 'cocopea', 'tech', 'firm', 'appscape', 'launch', 'job', 'hunting', 'app', 'datum', 'release', 'lpc', 'show', 'retail', 'sector', 'already', 'show', 'sign', 'increase', 'activity', 'sale', 'bounce', 'sale', 'pre', 'pandemic', 'time', 'third', 'quarter', 'year', 'come', 'even', 'vacate', 'space', 'record', 'square', 'meter', 'fourth', 'quarter', 'square', 'meter', 'attributable', 'offshore', 'gaming', 'operator', 'pogo', 'square', 'meter', 'player', 'struggle', 'recover', 'loss', 'still', 'lpc', 'say', 'rent', 'hold', 'owe', 'presence', 'information', 'technology', 'business', 'process', 'management', 'bpm', 'firm', 'multinational', 'take', 'peza', 'accredit', 'space', 'pogo', 'development', 'last', 'quarter', 'create', 'compelling', 'opportunity', 'bpm', 'player', 'thus', 'confident', 'continue', 'expand', 'country', 'remain', 'lead', 'outsourcing', 'arena', 'global', 'business', 'seek', 'cut', 'cost', 'recover', 'loss', 'leechiu', 'say', 'ldf']",0.9919,0.067,0.677,0.256,0.4421052631578948,Positive

Senator Leila De Lima has filed Senate Bill 1942, or the proposed ""Libreng Bakuna Kontra COVID-19 Para sa Lahat ng Pilipino Act,"" which allocates funds and mandates the country's health system to offer vaccines for all Filipinos for free.
“Anticipating the arrival of these vaccines subject to trials and local evaluation soonest, this representation believes the need to guarantee free vaccination for all Filipinos whose right to health should not be diminished by belatedly acting on the health crisis,” De Lima said in a statement in filing the bill.
“As hopes grow for the early arrival of vaccines in the country, we must be prepared and guarantee our people the safe and efficient distribution of the vaccine to all Filipinos, especially the priority and vulnerable sectors of our society. It cannot be overemphasized: vaccine coverage is as important as vaccine efficacy,” she added.
The Philippine government has set aside P73.2 billion for the procurement of a COVID-19 vaccine for 60 million Filipinos, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III earlier said.

He added the finance department estimated the cost of a vaccine to be around $25 or P1,200 per person.
“Ang total niyan is about P73.2 billion financing. That’s pretty much almost fixed… [that] is good for 60 million people to be vaccinated,” Dominguez said.
The vaccination of 60 million would allow for herd immunity, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said.
A herd immunity will allow a population to be protected from a virus if a threshold of vaccination is reached. Duque said that according to the World Health Organization, herd immunity may be achieved if 60 to 70 percent of the population is vaccinated.
De Lima said that the benefits of a universal vaccination would not only outweigh the costs, as it will be proven cost-effective and efficient in the long run.
“The cost of universal vaccination may seem too high on its face, but could later on be the very tool that will help the government to save more money in order to create and institutionalize more programs for the welfare of all,"" she said.
Aside from the free vaccine provision, the measure would allow persons to choose which accredited COVID vaccine they will get and the institutions from which to receive them.
Vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief Implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier reported that the Philippines is eyeing at least three to four vaccines for use in the Philippines with the earliest coming in the second quarter of next year.
The three vaccines, in order of stages of negotiations, are AztraZeneca from the United Kingdom, Sinovac from China, Pfizer from the US.
The measure also mandates the creation of a database to track vaccination receipts if ever there will be a problem in administering them. —LBG, GMA News",GMA News,4.0,0.569100022315979,"say, vaccine, health, dose, government, country, get, astrazeneca, also, sinovac","['measure', 'file', 'senate', 'seek', 'provide', 'free', 'vaccine', 'filipino', 'establish', 'safe', 'efficient', 'system', 'distribution', 'delivery', 'senator', 'file', 'senate', 'bill', 'propose', 'libreng', 'bakuna', 'kontra', 'pilipino', 'act', 'allocate', 'fund', 'mandate', 'countrys', 'health', 'system', 'offer', 'vaccine', 'filipino', 'free', 'anticipate', 'arrival', 'vaccine', 'subject', 'trial', 'local', 'evaluation', 'soon', 'representation', 'believe', 'need', 'guarantee', 'free', 'vaccination', 'filipino', 'right', 'health', 'diminish', 'belatedly', 'act', 'health', 'crisis', 'say', 'statement', 'filing', 'bill', 'hope', 'grow', 'early', 'arrival', 'vaccine', 'country', 'prepare', 'guarantee', 'people', 'safe', 'efficient', 'distribution', 'filipino', 'especially', 'priority', 'vulnerable_sector', 'society', 'overemphasize', 'coverage', 'important', 'efficacy', 'add', 'government', 'set_aside', 'procurement', 'filipino', 'finance', 'early', 'say', 'story', 'think', 'tank', 'passenger', 'group', 'call', 'dotr', 'naia', 'rehab', 'delay', 'blunder', 'health', 'protocol', 'enforce', 'strictly', 'holiday', 'season', 'ano', 'ncr', 'coronavirus', 'reproduction', 'rate', 'go', 'add', 'finance', 'department', 'estimate', 'cost', 'person', 'ang', 'total', 'niyan', 'financing', 'pretty', 'much', 'almost', 'fix', 'good', 'people', 'vaccinate', 'dominguez', 'say', 'vaccination', 'allow', 'health', 'say', 'herd_immunity', 'allow', 'population', 'protect', 'virus', 'threshold', 'vaccination', 'reach', 'duque', 'say', 'accord', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'herd_immunity', 'achieve', 'percent', 'population', 'vaccinate', 'say', 'benefit', 'universal', 'vaccination', 'outweigh', 'cost', 'prove', 'cost', 'effective', 'efficient', 'long', 'run', 'cost', 'universal', 'vaccination', 'seem', 'high', 'face', 'later', 'tool', 'help', 'government', 'save', 'money', 'order', 'create', 'program', 'welfare', 'say', 'aside', 'free', 'provision', 'measure', 'allow', 'person', 'choose', 'accredit', 'get', 'institution', 'receive', 'czar', 'force', 'secretary_carlito', 'early', 'report', 'eye', 'least', 'vaccine', 'use', 'early', 'come', 'next_year', 'vaccine', 'order', 'stage', 'negotiation', 'aztrazeneca', 'united_kingdom', 'sinovac', 'china', 'pfizer', 'measure', 'also', 'mandate', 'creation', 'database', 'track', 'vaccination', 'receipt', 'ever', 'problem', 'administer', 'lbg']",0.9946,0.033,0.713,0.254,0.4984249084249085,Positive

Blood samples from a group of 108 vaccinated adults showed both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses against the novel coronavirus in most of those tested.
Further studies will be needed to confirm whether the vaccine protects against infection.
""These results represent an important milestone.

""However ... the ability to trigger these immune responses does not necessarily indicate that the vaccine will protect humans from COVID-19 ... we are still a long way from this vaccine being available to all.""

""We plan to go into children as soon as we possibly can, but very carefully in terms of safety,"" J&J's Dr. Jerry Sadoff told a virtual meeting of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Friday.
Depending on safety and other factors, the company plans to test in even younger children afterwards, said Sadoff, a vaccine research scientist at J&J's Janssen unit, without giving a timeline.
J&J said in a statement that it is currently in discussions with regulators and partners regarding the inclusion of the pediatric population in its trials.
The US Food and Drug Administration has said it is important for drugmakers to test their vaccines in children. Some doctors have raised concerns that the vaccines themselves could trigger a rare, life-threatening condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in some children.

Rival drugmaker Pfizer Inc has already begun testing the COVID-19 vaccine it is developing with Germany's BioNTech in children as young as 12. Their vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA), a new technology that has yet to produce an approved vaccine. J&J's uses a cold virus to deliver coronavirus genetic material in order to spur an immune response. The platform - called AdVac - is used in a vaccine for Ebola that was approved in Europe earlier this year and used on more than 100,000 people, including infants, children, and pregnant women.
The technology's history of safety should be important to regulators, said Dr. Paul Spearman, director of the infectious diseases division of Cincinnati Children's Hospital.
""Most of the toxicities are going to come from the platform and not from putting a different insert into the platform, Spearman said. So replacing the Ebola genetic material with that of the novel coronavirus ""is unlikely to give you major issues,"" he added.

In a statement, Villanueva, who chairs the Senate committee on labor, warned against discriminating workers who decide not to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
“A worker can be late for work and be penalized with salary deduction. But a government guilty of vaccine tardiness faces no such reprimand, even if it causes the nation P2.8 billion in economic losses daily,” Villanueva said.
“A worker who is not yet immune from the virus shouldn't lose his immunity from being fired arbitrarily,"" he added.
The senator said that instead of forcing workers to get a vaccine and threatening their employment, employers should be carrying out confidence building efforts in their company.

“The biggest challenge at the moment for the labor-employer-government tripartite is not just to give more workers better vaccines but also to increase vaccine confidence,” Villanueva said.
""Sa pagbabakuna, the best pa rin po ang 'Sana All.' We cannot have a workforce divided between the ‘Jabbed’ and the ‘Jabbed Nots,'"" he added.
Several groups have opposed the supposed plan of some companies to impose a ""no vaccine, no work"" policy.
Some workers have reportedly approached the Associated Labor Union as early as last year expressing their concern over a warning by employers that their company will implement a ""no vaccine, no work"" policy.
Villanueva said workers should not be faulted for refusing to be vaccinated if they still have concerns on the vaccine to be used on them.
The challenge for the government now is to increase the public's level of confidence on the vaccines, he added.
""There has to be a concerted effort to bring up the degree of trust on vaccines because the restoration of jobs lost in the pandemic, and to a larger extent, our economic recovery, depend on the success of the vaccination program,” Villanueva said.
“If it is a brand even doctors are rejecting, you can understand where the hesitancy is coming from,” he added.
Villanueva earlier called on the government to have workers vaccinated as soon as possible, saying that the economy can only recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic if workers are protected against the disease.

Duque was responding to the challenge made by Senator Bong Go that Duque and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. should get the COVID-19 vaccine first to boost vaccine confidence among the populace. 
“Yes [I will do it]. Definitely. That is a no brainer. Sure. No problem,” Duque said in an ANC interview on Monday.
“I will take it as long as it has undergone scientific evaluation of the Department of Science and Technology’s Vaccine Experts Panel, the Ethics Board Review and the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) which will conduct its own regulatory assessment,"" Duque added.
A COVID-19 vaccine needs to hurdle such three stages before it can be administered or sold in the Philippines.

“I encourage my fellow Cabinet members and other government officials to join me,” Duque added.
Back in November 2018, a measles outbreak occurred in the country because vaccine confidence was reduced from 92% to 33% amid the anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia controversy.
That staggering loss of vaccine confidence happened a year after officials of Dengvaxia manufacturer Sanofi announced that their vaccine posed a risk to those who have not been infected by dengue prior to being injected with the vaccine. 
This announcement only came after the vaccine has already been administered to over 700,000 children and even policemen.
 
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Sanofi returned P1.16 billion to the Department of Health for the unused doses of vaccine.

Dr. John Ong urged the Philippines to continue using the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) 13 as the country grapples with the coronavirus menace.
“If you are inoculated for pneumonia, you are indirectly strengthening your body’s defenses against COVID-19,” he said in a radio interview.
Pneumonia is one of the potential complications of COVID-19.
Ong said the Philippines must stick to the broad-spectrum PCV 13, which combats 13 pneumococcal strains, rather than the PCV 10 because it is “more cost-effective.”

Duque agreed with Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire who earlier said that the DOH is reserving its evaluation on the Russian vaccine since it is still under Phase 3 of the clinical trials.
“Hindi pa po nakakapaglabas ng resulta ang Phase 3 ng clinical trials rito, although sinasabi nila na maganda at okay naman siya. Kailangang antayin po natin ang magiging resulta [ng clinical trials],” Vergeire said in an Unang Hirit interview.
For his part, Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) director general Eric Domingo said the Russia-developed COVID-19 vaccine will still be under the review of the regulatory agency.
Interviewed on Dobol B sa News TV, Domingo said the review on the vaccine will take two to four weeks.
“Ang FDA, sinusuri niya lahat ng data. Kailangan maipakita po sa amin 'yung data, findings, tsaka 'yung scientific na mga information about the vaccine to assure na safe siya at tsaka effective siya,” he said.
The Philippines has recorded 139,538 COVID-19 cases so far. Of this number, 68,432 recovered while 2,312 died.
The number of active COVID-19 cases is at 68,794. 
Ongoing trials
During the Unang Hirit interview, Vergeire said it is still not certain if such a vaccine will be available locally by December.
“Hindi pa po natin masabi kasi nasa Phase 3 pa lang ng clinical trials. Makikita po natin kung paano magpo-progress ito,” she said when asked on the possibility of the vaccine's availability by December.
“Itong bakuna galing Russia... ito ay nasa Phase 3 ng clinical trials. Kailangang tapusin muna Phase 3 clinical trials.” 
Vergeire also said aside from the one in Russia, the country is also considering five other possible vaccines from other countries. She said experts from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) are studying which of the six is best for the Philippines.
“Iyong DOST, may vaccine experts po tayo roon. May anim na bakuna na all over the world na nasa Phase 3 ng clinical trials,” she said.
“Nag-meeting kami last week, at pinakita nila ang iba’t ibang characteristics ng bawat bakuna, ang main function nito, kung saan makakatulong at saka iyong disadvantage, kung ilan iyong masu-supply ng bawat manufacturer,” she added.
WHO eyes review
The World Health Organization, meanwhile, said any WHO stamp of approval on a COVID-19 vaccine candidate would require a rigorous safety data review.
""We are in close contact with the Russian health authorities and discussions are ongoing with respect to possible WHO pre-qualification of the vaccine,"" said the United Nations health agency's spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.
A total of 168 candidate vaccines are being worked on around the world, according to a WHO overview published Tuesday.

WHO country representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe underscored that the vaccines from COVAX are intended to protect the most vulnerable groups: health workers, the elderly, and people with comorbidities.
“If we want to ensure that we continue to access the vaccines from the COVAX Facility, we need to demonstrate that we can follow this prioritization,” he said in a virtual briefing.
The COVAX Facility is a WHO-led initiative that seeks to ensure equitable access to vaccines, especially for poorer nations.
“If we cannot demonstrate that we are following this prioritization, unfortunately the COVAX may have to consider other options where the impact of the vaccine rollout will be more useful and practical and will contribute to saving more lives,” Abeyasinghe said.

But it may be another year to 18 months before it becomes available, once it has passed more trial phases to prove it works and is safe.
The vaccine is called mRNA-1273 and was developed by US National Institutes of Health (NIH) scientists and collaborators at biotechnology company Moderna, which is based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
""The open-label trial will enroll 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years over approximately 6 weeks,"" the NIH said. ""The first participant received the investigational vaccine today.""
Funding was also provided by the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments against the coronavirus disease, known as COVID-19, which has infected more than 175,000 people across the world since it was first identified in central China in late December.
It has claimed 7,000 deaths, according to an AFP tally, most in China followed by Italy.
""Finding a safe and effective vaccine to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent public health priority,"" said Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the NIH, using the technical name for the virus that is believed to have originated in bats.
""This Phase 1 study, launched in record speed, is an important first step toward achieving that goal.""
The Seattle trial will study the impact of different doses delivered by intramuscular injection in the upper arm, with participants monitored for side-effects like soreness or fever.
Coronaviruses are spherical and have spikes protruding from their surface, giving them a crown-like appearance. The spike binds to human cells, allowing the virus to gain entry.
The Moderna candidate vaccine carries the genetic information of this spike in a substance called ""messenger RNA.""
Injecting human tissue with the spike's messenger RNA makes it grow inside the body, thereby eliciting an immune response without having actually infected a person with the full-blown virus.
Global race
Pharmaceuticals and research labs around the world are racing to develop both treatments and vaccines to the new coronavirus.
An antiviral treatment called remdesivir, made by US-based Gilead Sciences, is already in the final stages of clinical trials in Asia and doctors in China have reported it has proven effective in fighting the disease.
But only randomized trials allow scientists to know for sure whether it really helps or whether patients would have recovered without it.
Another US pharma called Inovio, which is creating a DNA-based vaccine, has said it will enter clinical trials next month.
Regeneron is trying to isolate coronavirus-fighting antibodies that can be administered intravenously to confer temporary immunity, and hopes to start human trials by summer.
According to the World Health Organization, 80 percent of COVID-19 cases are mild, 14 percent are severe and about five percent result are critical, resulting in severe respiratory illness that causes the lungs to fill with fluid which in turn prevents oxygen from reaching organs.
Patients with mild cases recover in a week or two while severe cases can take six or more weeks.
Recent estimates suggest about one percent of all infected people die. — AFP",GMA News,2.0,0.6294000148773193,"say, vaccine, health, dose, first, government, trial, country, world, ng","['first', 'human', 'trial', 'evaluate', 'candidate', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'begin', 'seattle', 'health', 'official', 'say', 'monday', 'raise', 'hope', 'global', 'fight', 'disease', 'year', 'month', 'pass', 'trial', 'phase', 'prove', 'work', 'safe', 'call', 'mrna', 'develop', 'national', 'institutes', 'health', 'nih', 'scientist', 'collaborator', 'biotechnology', 'company', 'moderna', 'base', 'cambridge', 'open', 'label', 'trial', 'enroll', 'healthy', 'adult', 'volunteer', 'age', 'year', 'approximately', 'week', 'nih', 'say', 'first', 'participant', 'receive', 'investigational', 'today', 'funding', 'also', 'provide', 'oslo', 'base', 'coalition', 'innovation', 'story', 'nih', 'admit', 'healthcare', 'worker', 'infect', 'ebola', 'moderna', 'develop', 'booster', 'shoot', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'variant', 'increase', 'production', 'target', 'wrist', 'band', 'device', 'alcohol', 'monitoring', 'win', 'prize', 'currently', 'approve', 'vaccine', 'treatment', 'coronavirus', 'disease', 'know', 'infected', 'people', 'world', 'first', 'identify', 'central', 'china', 'late', 'claim', 'death', 'accord', 'afp', 'tally', 'china', 'follow', 'italy', 'find', 'safe', 'effective', 'prevent', 'infection', 'sars_cov', 'urgent', 'public', 'health', 'priority', 'say', 'head', 'nih', 'use', 'technical', 'name', 'virus', 'believe', 'originate', 'bat', 'phase', 'study', 'launch', 'record', 'speed', 'important', 'first', 'step', 'achieve', 'goal', 'seattle', 'trial', 'study', 'impact', 'different', 'dose', 'deliver', 'intramuscular', 'injection', 'upper', 'arm', 'participant', 'monitor', 'side_effect', 'soreness', 'fever', 'coronaviruse', 'spherical', 'spike', 'protrude', 'surface', 'give', 'crown', 'appearance', 'spike', 'bind', 'human', 'cell', 'allow', 'virus', 'gain', 'entry', 'moderna', 'candidate', 'carry', 'genetic', 'information', 'spike', 'substance', 'call', 'inject', 'human', 'tissue', 'spike', 'make', 'grow', 'body', 'thereby', 'elicit', 'immune_response', 'actually', 'infect', 'person', 'full', 'blown', 'virus', 'global', 'race', 'pharmaceutical', 'research', 'lab', 'world', 'race', 'develop', 'treatment', 'vaccine', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'antiviral', 'treatment', 'call', 'remdesivir', 'make', 'base', 'gilead', 'science', 'already', 'final', 'stage', 'clinical_trial', 'asia', 'doctor', 'china', 'report', 'prove', 'effective', 'fighting', 'disease', 'randomized', 'trial', 'allow', 'scientist', 'know', 'sure', 'really', 'help', 'patient', 'recover', 'pharma', 'call', 'inovio', 'create', 'dna', 'base', 'say', 'enter', 'clinical_trial', 'next', 'month', 'regeneron', 'try', 'isolate', 'coronavirus', 'fight', 'antibody', 'administer', 'intravenously', 'confer', 'temporary', 'immunity', 'hope', 'start', 'human', 'trial', 'summer', 'accord', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'percent', 'case', 'mild', 'percent', 'severe', 'percent', 'result', 'critical', 'result', 'severe', 'respiratory', 'illness', 'cause', 'lung', 'fill', 'fluid', 'turn', 'prevent', 'oxygen', 'reach', 'organ', 'patient', 'mild', 'case', 'recover', 'week', 'severe', 'case', 'take', 'week', 'recent', 'estimate', 'suggest', 'percent', 'infect', 'people', 'die', 'afp']",0.9336,0.098,0.749,0.153,0.4422783389450057,Positive

This means the budget items will only be funded if the government is able to raise enough resources. 
“Ako, deskumpiyado ako sa P54 billion kasi under unprogramemd fund. Kapag unprogrammed, ala tsamba ‘yun eh, depende kung makakakolekta ang gobyerno ng maraming buwis,” Marcos said.

“They said we can vaccinate in three to five years. I have a different suggestion. The initial volume of vaccines from AstraZeneca, Pfizer and Moderna should be focused on NCR which has a population of 13 million, Calabarzon and Central Luzon because these areas make up 70% of the economic epicenter of the country,” Leachon said in an ANC interview.
“Once we are okay with the 70% of our economic epicenter, then we should focus on other hotspots [of COVID-19] like Davao and Cebu,” Leachon added.
Doing so would enable the government to achieve its target in two years instead of five, he said.

Leachon was referring to the timeline given by vaccine czar and National Task Force Chief Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. that 100 million Filipinos will be given a COVID-19 vaccine in five years or 20 million Filipinos annually. 
Health Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire deferred commenting on Galvez’s timeline since the country has no COVID-19 vaccines yet approved by Philippine regulators. The government and the private sector recently inked a a deal with British firm AstraZeneca for an initial 2.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines.
Vergeire said the Department of Health's best performance in mass vaccination came in 1998 when it was able to vaccinate the targeted 85% of the 22.9 million children needing immunization.
However, she conceded that the DOH will not be able to vaccinate 70% of Filipinos within a year mainly due to lack of COVID-19 vaccine supply. 
For Leachon, though, a two-year timeline for vaccination will work if those residing in 70% of the economic epicenter will be prioritized.
“If we want to spread the vaccine thinly, surely it will take us three to five years. But if we want to be agile, we can finish in two years if we focus on the economic epicenter first. Economic recovery would need herd immunity, and the vaccination of 70% in these areas will enable them to return to normalcy and cause faster economic recovery,” Leachon said.
Only COVID-19 vaccines from American firms Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, as well as British firm AstraZeneca in a joint effort with Oxford University, have been proven to be over 90% effective after human trials. 
Vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, however, cost more. They also pose logistical challenges to low and middle income countries since they require ultra low freezer or -70 degrees to -80 degrees Celsius temperature for storage.
Galvez Jr. said last week that more than 35 million Filipinos will be prioritized to receive vaccines against COVID-19.
He said the priority list of vaccine recipients came from the DOH and was created with the guidance of President Rodrigo Duterte.
As a strategy, the vaccination will start in areas that are most affected by the pandemic as well as those considered as business centers so the country will immediately feel its effect, Galvez said.
Areas Galvez identified include the NCR, Calabarzon, Central Luzon, Cebu, Davao, and Cagayan de Oro.

AstraZeneca-Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine has been found 70% effective against COVID-19 at first dose, but it increases to 90% after the second dose is administered a month after the first dose.
Likewise, AstraZeneca’s price range is cheaper at $3 to $4 compared with American firms Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech which COVID-19 vaccines proved also over 90% effective costing more due to the requirement of an ultra low freezer storage.
AstraZeneca, however, has admitted that the initial results of its COVID-19 candidate vaccine still needs to be evaluated following concerns raised by experts that it had to reduce its first dose to half since administering two doses in full only resulted in 62% efficacy.
Likewise, AstraZeneca's human trials in the United Kingdom did not include participants aged 56 years old and above, considered a vulnerable sector of the population alongside health workers.
But for Concepcion, presidential adviser for entrepreneurship, such initial concerns are part of the process and does not change the credibility of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine.
“The concerns [on AstraZeneca]  are part of the process in development of vaccines, and they were able to show good results. It is worth the risk to put the bet on this and I think they will come through,” he said.
Finance Secretary Sonny Dominguez earlier said that the Philippines would need P73 billion to purchase a COVID-19 vaccine for 70% of the Philippine population which is at 110 million.—with Reuters/AOL, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.9205999970436096,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['get', 'shot', 'potential', 'develop', 'astrazeneca', 'countrys', 'first', 'supply', 'deal', 'coronavirus', 'senior', 'official', 'say', 'friday', 'supply', 'pay', 'private_sector', 'inoculate', 'filipino', 'british', 'drugmaker', 'require', 'dose', 'say', 'jose', 'concepcion', 'government', 'business', 'adviser', 'represent', 'galvez', 'say', 'authority', 'also', 'negotiate', 'astrazeneca', 'possible', 'purchase', 'dose', 'sign', 'government', 'astrazeneca', 'galvez', 'call', 'initiative', 'significant', 'development', 'provide', 'equitable_access', 'back', 'reputable', 'institution', 'astrazeneca', 'provision', 'scheme', 'profit', 'oxford_university', 'back', 'british', 'government', 'confidence', 'make', 'astrazeneca', 'see', 'light', 'end', 'tunnel', 'say', 'story', 'case', 'new', 'infection', 'second', 'chinese', 'candidate', 'get', 'clearance', 'expert', 'panel', 'gov', 'order', 'consolidation', 'datum', 'digital', 'contact_trace', 'app', 'like', 'thank', 'private_sector', 'assure', 'least', 'dose', 'add', 'astrazeneca', 'find', 'effective', 'first', 'dose', 'increase', 'second', 'dose', 'administer', 'month', 'first', 'dose', 'likewise', 'astrazeneca', 'price', 'range', 'cheap', 'compare', 'vaccine', 'prove', 'also', 'effective', 'cost', 'due', 'requirement', 'freezer', 'storage', 'astrazeneca', 'however', 'admit', 'initial', 'result', 'candidate', 'still', 'need', 'evaluate', 'follow', 'concern', 'raise', 'expert', 'reduce', 'first', 'dose', 'half', 'administer', 'dose', 'full', 'resulted', 'efficacy', 'likewise', 'astrazenecas', 'human', 'trial', 'include', 'participant', 'aged_year', 'old', 'consider', 'vulnerable', 'sector', 'population', 'health', 'worker', 'concepcion', 'presidential_adviser', 'initial', 'concern', 'part', 'process', 'change', 'credibility', 'astrazeneca', 'concern', 'astrazeneca', 'part', 'process', 'development', 'vaccine', 'show', 'good', 'result', 'worth', 'risk', 'put', 'bet', 'think', 'come', 'say', 'finance', 'secretary', 'early', 'say', 'need', 'purchase', 'population', 'reuters', 'aol']",0.9732,0.026,0.824,0.151,0.356198347107438,Positive

PANTI,2020-11-27 14:14:00,"Another Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccine has secured approval from the Philippines' Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP) for the conduct of clinical trials, an official said Friday.
Dr. Jaime Montoya of the Philippine Council for Health Research said China's Clover Biopharma was cleared by the VEP last November 20, making it the second Chinese firm to do so after Sinovac.
“The candidate vaccine already passed the VEP review and it is already under review by the Ethics Board,” Montoya said in an online forum.
“Iyong sa Ethics Board, ang alam ko minor information na lang ang hinahanap pa nila. Kaya puwede na magsimula ang clinical trial at the earliest by late December or early January,” he added.
After hurdling the VEP and the Ethics Board, firms with candidate COVID-19 vaccines would still have to get the approval of the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they can proceed with the clinical trials in the country.

The same process of securing clearance from VEP, Ethics Board and Philippine FDA will be implemented for manufacturers that intend to sell their COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines, even if these vaccines already secured approval from regulatory agencies abroad.
Sinovac was cleared by the VEP last October 15.
The frontrunners in the COVID-19 vaccine race, however, were those manufactured by American firms Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna since their candidate COVID-19 vaccines were found to be at least 94% effective after human trials.
The vaccine developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca with Oxford University was also found 70% effective after the first half dose and 90% in the second full dose  after human trials.
AstraZeneca-Oxford's candidate COVID-19 vaccine is cheaper than those made by American firms mainly because it does not require ultra-low freezer of -70 degrees Celsius for storage. —KBK, GMA News",GMA News,0.0,0.5508000254631042,"say, vaccine, dose, government, country, health, first, also, astrazeneca, pfizer","['chinese', 'make', 'secured', 'approval', 'vep', 'conduct', 'clinical_trial', 'official', 'say', 'friday', 'montoya', 'council', 'health', 'research', 'say', 'chinas', 'clover', 'biopharma', 'clear', 'last', 'november', 'make', 'second', 'chinese', 'firm', 'sinovac', 'candidate', 'already', 'pass', 'vep', 'review', 'already', 'review', 'montoya', 'say', 'online', 'forum', 'iyong', 'sa', 'minor', 'information', 'na', 'pa', 'nila', 'kaya', 'puwede', 'na', 'ang', 'clinical', 'trial', 'early', 'late', 'december', 'early', 'january', 'add', 'hurdle', 'firm', 'candidate', 'vaccine', 'still', 'get', 'approval', 'food', 'fda', 'proceed', 'clinical_trial', 'country', 'story', 'gov', 'order', 'consolidation', 'datum', 'digital', 'contact_trace', 'app', 'solon', 'belie', 'report', 'health', 'protocol', 'observe', 'meeting', 'attend', 'lapena', 'iatf', 'allow', 'high', 'passenger', 'capacity', 'commission', 'shuttle', 'service', 'process', 'secure', 'clearance', 'implement', 'manufacturer', 'intend', 'sell', 'vaccine', 'even', 'vaccine', 'already', 'secure', 'approval', 'regulatory', 'agency', 'abroad', 'sinovac', 'clear', 'last', 'october', 'frontrunner', 'race', 'however', 'manufacture', 'american_firm', 'moderna', 'candidate', 'vaccine', 'find', 'least', 'effective', 'human', 'trial', 'develop', 'british', 'drugmaker', 'astrazeneca', 'oxford_university', 'also', 'find', 'effective', 'first', 'half', 'dose', 'second', 'full', 'dose', 'human', 'trial', 'astrazeneca', 'oxford', 'candidate', 'cheaper', 'make', 'american_firm', 'mainly', 'require', 'freezer', 'storage', 'kbk']",0.9501,0.03,0.83,0.14,0.30083333333333334,Positive

Duque made the statement in response to the remarks of Philippine Foundation for Vaccination (PFV) director Dr. Lulu Bravo that the 50 million vaccine supplies assured to the Philippine government are not enough to reach herd immunity.
“Hindi po tama 'yung kanilang iniisip dahil nga po ang totoo nga po d'yan, matapos po kaming pinulong ni Pangulong Duterte noong Lunes ay malinaw na tayo ay nakapag-raise ng at least mga P73.2 billion for 60 million population,” Duque said.
“Yan po ang aming pinupunterya dahil nga po ang herd immunity ay puwedeng makamit, batay sa World Health Organization at mga dalubhasa, kung mababakunahan 60% to 70% of the population,” he added.
Bravo cited vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. on the P50 million vaccines that the Philippines will have in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Kung totoo na sinabi 'yun ni Secretary Galvez na as much as 50 million daw ang makukuha ng Pilipinas, e di halos kalahati na 'yun ng ating population, dahil ang populasyon natin 110 million na yata di ba,” she said in an interview on GMA Network’s Unang Hirit.
“So kung may 50 million, that is two doses, 25 million lang ang puwedeng mabigyan. Kung two doses 'yun, tapos ang mabibigyan mo lang is 25 million, one-fourth ng ating population, hindi pa 'yun herd immunity, kasi sabi mo nga 60 to 70 percent,” she added.
Earlier, Galvez reported that the government is eyeing to secure COVID-19 vaccine supply deals from manufacturers in China, United Kingdom, and the United States within the month.
According to him, the country will be assured of as much as 30 to 50 million COVID-19 vaccine supply.

""So kung ganoon, 'wag ka sanang mamatay hanggang January. Hintayin mo 'yung vaccine. 'Pag tinawag ka ng kamatayan, sabihin mo p— ina ka umalis ka diyan, may hinihintay ako na vaccine. Hindi ko pa panahon mamatay,"" Duterte said.

'Yung sariling katawan mo lang. Walang medisina, walang antibiotic,"" added Duterte, who previously offered a P50 million reward to those would discover a vaccine for COVID-19.
The President reminded the public to follow protocols against the virus such as social distancing, the use of mask, and proper cough etiquette.
""COVID will remain with us until such time na nabakunahan tayong lahat. Hindi sabihin na may bakuna na at successful na at okay na. Hanggat hindi ka matusukan ng vaccine. You are still in danger,"" Duterte said.

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/science/763720/russia-says-its-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-is-92-effective/story/,Russia says its Sputnik V COVID-19 vaccine is 92% effective,GMA News,2020-11-11 17:35:00,"MOSCOW - Russia's Sputnik V vaccine is 92% effective at protecting people from COVID-19 according to interim trial results, the country's sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday, as Moscow rushes to keep pace with Western drugmakers in the race for a shot.
The initial results are only the second to be published from a late-stage human trial in the global effort to produce vaccines that could halt a pandemic that has killed more than 1.2 million people and ravaged the world economy.
Russia registered its COVID-19 vaccine for public use in August, the first country to do so, though the approval came before the start of the large-scale trial in September.
""We are showing, based on the data, that we have a very effective vaccine,"" said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev, adding that it was the sort of news that the vaccine's developers would talk about one day with their grandchildren.
The interim results are based on data from the first 16,000 trial participants to receive both shots of the two-dose vaccine, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which has been backing the vaccine and marketing it globally, said.

The interim analysis was conducted after 20 participants in the trial developed COVID-19 and examined how many had received the vaccine versus a placebo.
That is significantly lower than the 94 infections in the trial of a vaccine being developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech. To confirm the efficacy rate, Pfizer said it would continue its trial until there were 164 COVID-19 cases.
The Russian trial will continue for six more months, RDIF said in a statement, and data from the trial will also be published in a leading international medical journal following a peer review.
Sputnik V 
The so-called Phase III trial of the shot developed by the Gamaleya Institute is taking place in 29 clinics across Moscow and will involve 40,000 volunteers in total, with a quarter receiving a placebo shot.
The chances of contracting COVID-19 were 92% lower among people vaccinated with Sputnik V than those who received the placebo, the RDIF said.
That's well above the 50% effectiveness threshold for COVID-19 vaccines set by the US Food and Drug Administration.
Russia's announcement follows swiftly on from results posted on Monday by Pfizer and BioNTech, who said their shot was also more than 90% effective.
The Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology and is designed to trigger an immune response without using pathogens, such as actual virus particles.
The Sputnik V vaccine is designed to trigger a response from two shots administered 21 days apart each based on different viral vectors that normally cause the common cold: human adenoviruses Ad5 and Ad26.
The drug is named Sputnik V after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race, a nod to the project's geopolitical importance for Putin.
Russia is also testing a different vaccine, produced by the Vector Institute in Siberia, and is on the cusp of registering a third, Putin said on Tuesday, adding that all of the country's vaccines were effective.
""Studies have already shown and confirmed that, firstly, these vaccines are safe and have no serious side effects after use, and secondly, they are all effective,"" the RIA news agency quoted Putin as saying.
RDIF said no serious side effects had been reported during the Sputnik V Phase III trial so far.
Mass vaccinations
Successful vaccines are seen as a crucial to restoring daily life around the world by helping end the health crisis that shuttered businesses and put millions out of work.
Russia registered the vaccine for domestic use in August, prior to the start of the large-scale trial, and has also inoculated 10,000 people considered at high risk of COVID-19 outside of the trial
Putin has said that Russia expects to start mass vaccinations by the end of the year.
""The publication of the interim results of the post-registration clinical trials that convincingly demonstrate Sputnik V vaccine’s efficacy gives way to mass vaccination in Russia against COVID-19 in the coming weeks,"" Alexander Gintsburg, director of the Gamaleya Institute, said.
Moscow is rolling out a large network of vaccination rooms and residents who want the shot may be able to get it as early as next month if large volumes of doses are supplied by then, Deputy Mayor Anastasia Rakova said on Oct. 30.
However, production challenges remain. Earlier estimates that Russia could produce 30 million doses of the vaccine this year have since been scaled down.
Moscow aims to produce 800,000 doses this month, industry minister Denis Manturov has said, followed by 1.5 million in December. But significantly higher volumes of output per month are expected from early 2021.
Manturov cited issues with scaling up production from small to large-volume bioreactors, while Putin last month cited issues with the availability of equipment.
Officials have said that domestic production of the vaccine will be used first to meet Russia's needs.
RDIF, however, has also struck several international supply deals, amounting to 270 million doses in total.
It is expected that these will in large part be produced in other countries and RDIF has previously announced a deal to manufacture 300 million doses in India and an undisclosed amount of doses in Brazil, China and South Korea.
Trials of the vaccine have also begun in Belarus, and are on track to begin soon in the United Arab Emirates, Venezuela and India.
Russia reported 19,851 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours and a record high of 432 deaths. At 1,836,960, its overall case tally is the fifth largest in the world, behind the United States, India, Brazil and France.
Authorities, however, have been adamant that severe lockdown restrictions, like those seen in the spring, will not be reintroduced. — Reuters",GMA News,1.0,0.995199978351593,"say, vaccine, dose,

The vaccine candidate, called BBIBP-CorV, induced high-level neutralizing antibodies that can block the virus from infecting cells in monkeys, rats, guinea pigs and rabbits, researchers said in a paper published in online by the medical journal Cell on Saturday.
""These results support the further evaluation of BBIBP-CorV in a clinical trial,"" researchers said in the paper.
BBIBP-CorV, developed by Beijing Institute of Biological Products affiliated to state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), is among five candidates China is testing in humans.
More than 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of development around the world. Among front runners currently in human trials are being developed by AstraZeneca , Pfizer, BioNtech, Johnson & Johnson , Merck, Moderna, Sanofi and China's CanSino Biologics.

As well as appearing safe and able to generate an immune response in animals, BBIBP-CorV did not appear to trigger antibodies that could boost the infection - a phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE)- the researchers said, although this does not necessarily guarantee ADE won't occur in human tests.
Apart from BBIBP-CorV, Sinopharm, which has invested 1 billion yuan ($141.40 million) in vaccine projects, is testing in humans another vaccine candidate developed by its Wuhan-based unit.

https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/science/758817/q-amp-a-where-are-we-in-the-covid-19-vaccine-race/story/,Q&A: Where are we in the COVID-19 vaccine race?,CARL O'DONNELL,2020-10-07 14:03:00,"NEW YORK - Drugmakers and research centers around the world are working on COVID-19 vaccines, with large global trials of several of the candidates involving tens of thousands of participants well underway.
As some companies close in on unveiling their initial findings — with Canadian and European regulators already reviewing early data on some vaccines — the following is what we know about the race to deliver vaccines to help end the coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over a million lives:
Who is furthest along?
US drugmaker Pfizer Inc with German partner BioNTech SE, US biotech Moderna Inc and Britain-based AstraZeneca Plc in conjunction with University of Oxford researchers could provide early analyses of data from their various large trials over the next two months. Johnson & Johnson is not far behind.
What happens in these trials?
The companies are testing their vaccines against a placebo — typically saline solution — in healthy volunteers to see if the rate of COVID-19 infection among those who got the vaccine is significantly lower than in those who received the dummy shot.
Neither trial participants nor researchers know who has received the vaccine or placebo until the data is ready for review, or unblinded. The studies rely on subjects becoming naturally infected with COVID-19, so how long it takes to generate results largely depends on how pervasive the virus is where the trials are being conducted.
In areas with large outbreaks and community spread, infections will pile up faster.
How will we know if the vaccine works?
The United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the World Health Organization have all set similar minimum standards for effectiveness. Vaccines must demonstrate at least 50% efficacy — meaning at least twice as many infections among volunteers who got a placebo than in the vaccine group. Independent panels oversee the trials to monitor for safety and effectiveness since the data is hidden from companies and researchers. These data safety monitoring boards take a peek at the interim results at pre-determined milestones, such as after a certain number of people have become infected. It the vaccine is looking significantly better than the placebo, the companies can apply for emergency use, and the study may be halted or continue to its intended conclusion. A trial also can be halted if the panel determines the vaccine to be unsafe.
Will regulators ensure a vaccine is safe before making it available to the public?
The US Food and Drug Administration has said it will not approve a vaccine unless it is both effective and safe. On Tuesday, it added more stringent safety guidelines for US vaccines. The FDA wants developers to follow trial subjects for at least two months after they receive their final vaccine dose to check for any side effects that may crop up. The agency will consider an emergency use authorization (EUA) once that data is collected from at least half of the trial's participants. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will review the vaccines for the UK and the European Medicines Agency will review vaccines for European Union use.
When will regulators decide?
Regulators will review the vaccines after the companies have enough data to submit applications seeking an EUA or formal approval. Pfizer/BioNtech will likely know how well its vaccine works as soon as this month, while Moderna’s first look at data is more likely to come next month. AstraZeneca could provide a look at late-stage data in the next two months. Regulators for Europe and Canada are considering data on a rolling basis, as it becomes available. The UK and the US both expect speedy reviews of initial data for possible emergency use before more traditional lengthy reviews for formal commercial approvals.
Could these be the first approved coronavirus vaccines?
Yes, although China and Russia are on a similar timeline.
China launched an emergency use program in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection that has vaccinated hundreds of thousands of people. At least four vaccines are far along including from China National Biotec Group (CNBG), CanSino Biologics and Sinovac. Sinovac and CNBG have said to expect early trial data as soon as November.
Russia’s Gamaleya Institute has begun a 40,000-person late-stage trial and is expected to have early data at the end of October or early November. Russia has also given the vaccine to at least hundreds of “high-risk” members of the general population.
Is US authorization up to President Trump?
The FDA must make sure that the benefits of a vaccine outweigh the risks before authorization since they are intended to be given to hundreds of millions of healthy people. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has the authority to override the FDA's recommendation. US President Donald Trump has complained about the new safety guidelines that would likely delay any vaccine availability until after the Nov. 3 presidential election. The Trump administration can hire and fire HHS officials, opening the possibility of political pressure to approve a vaccine. —Reuters",GMA News,1.0,0.9969000220298767,"say, vaccine, dose, government, astrazeneca, trial, health, country, early, get","['new_york', 'drugmaker', 'research', 'center', 'world', 'work', 'vaccine', 'large', 'global', 'trial', 'several', 'candidate', 'involve', 'ten', 'thousand', 'participant', 'well', 'underway', 'company', 'close', 'unveil', 'initial', 'finding', 'canadian', 'european', 'regulator', 'already', 'review', 'early', 'data', 'vaccine', 'follow', 'know', 'race', 'deliver', 'vaccine', 'help', 'end', 'coronavirus', 'pandemic', 'claim', 'life', 'furthest', 'pfizer', 'inc', 'biotech', 'moderna', 'inc', 'britain', 'base', 'astrazeneca', 'plc', 'conjunction', 'university', 'oxford', 'researcher', 'provide', 'early', 'analysis', 'datum', 'various', 'large', 'trial', 'month', 'far', 'behind', 'happen', 'trial', 'company', 'test', 'vaccine', 'placebo', 'typically', 'saline', 'solution', 'healthy', 'volunteer', 'see', 'rate', 'infection', 'get', 'significantly', 'low', 'receive', 'dummy', 'shoot', 'trial', 'participant', 'researcher', 'know', 'receive', 'placebo', 'datum', 'ready', 'review', 'unblinded', 'study', 'rely', 'subject', 'become', 'naturally', 'infect', 'long', 'take', 'generate', 'result', 'largely', 'depend', 'pervasive', 'virus', 'trial', 'conduct', 'area', 'large', 'outbreak', 'community', 'spread', 'infection', 'pile', 'fast', 'know', 'work', 'united_state', 'united_kingdom', 'world', 'health', 'organization', 'set', 'similar', 'minimum', 'standard', 'effectiveness', 'vaccine', 'demonstrate', 'least', 'efficacy', 'meaning', 'least', 'twice', 'many', 'infection', 'volunteer', 'get', 'placebo', 'group', 'independent', 'panel', 'oversee', 'trial', 'monitor', 'safety', 'effectiveness', 'datum', 'hide', 'company', 'researcher', 'data', 'safety', 'monitoring', 'board', 'take', 'peek', 'interim_result', 'pre', 'determine', 'milestone', 'certain', 'number', 'people', 'become', 'infected', 'look', 'significantly', 'well', 'placebo', 'company', 'apply', 'study', 'halted', 'continue', 'intend', 'conclusion', 'trial', 'also', 'halt', 'panel', 'determine', 'unsafe', 'regulator', 'ensure', 'safe', 'making', 'available', 'public', 'food', 'say', 'approve', 'effective', 'safe', 'tuesday', 'add', 'stringent', 'safety', 'guideline', 'vaccine', 'fda', 'want', 'developer', 'follow', 'trial', 'subject', 'least', 'month', 'receive', 'final', 'dose', 'check', 'side_effect', 'crop', 'agency', 'consider', 'datum', 'collect', 'least', 'half', 'trial', 'participant', 'uk', 'medicine', 'healthcare', 'product', 'regulatory', 'agency', 'review', 'vaccine', 'uk', 'european', 'medicine', 'agency', 'review', 'vaccine', 'european_union', 'use', 'regulator', 'decide', 'regulator', 'review', 'vaccine', 'company', 'enough', 'datum', 'submit', 'application', 'seek', 'formal', 'approval', 'likely', 'know', 'work', 'soon', 'month', 'moderna', 'first', 'look', 'datum', 'likely', 'come', 'next', 'month', 'astrazeneca', 'provide', 'look', 'late_stage', 'datum', 'month', 'regulator', 'europe', 'canada', 'consider', 'data', 'roll', 'basis', 'uk', 'expect', 'speedy', 'review', 'initial', 'datum', 'possible', 'emergency_use', 'traditional', 'lengthy', 'review', 'formal', 'commercial', 'approval', 'first', 'approve', 'coronavirus', 'vaccine', 'china', 'russia', 'similar', 'timeline', 'china', 'launch', 'program', 'july', 'aim', 'essential', 'worker', 'other', 'infection', 'vaccinate', 'hundred', 'thousand', 'people', 'least', 'vaccine', 'far', 'include', 'china', 'national', 'biotec', 'group', 'cnbg', 'cansino_biologic', 'sinovac', 'cnbg', 'say', 'expect', 'early', 'trial', 'datum', 'soon', 'november', 'institute', 'begin', 'person', 'late_stage', 'trial', 'expect', 'early', 'datum', 'end', 'october', 'early', 'november', 'russia', 'also', 'give', 'least', 'hundred', 'member', 'general', 'population', 'authorization', 'president', 'trump', 'benefit', 'outweigh', 'risk', 'authorization', 'intend', 'give', 'hundred', 'million', 'healthy', 'people', 'however', 'department', 'health', 'human', 'service', 'hhs', 'authority', 'override', 'recommendation', 'president', 'trump', 'complain', 'new', 'safety', 'guideline', 'likely', 'delay', 'availability', 'nov', 'presidential', 'election', 'trump', 'administration', 'hire', 'fire', 'hhs', 'official', 'open', 'possibility', 'political', 'pressure', 'approve', 'reuter']",0.9836,0.047,0.83,0.123,0.41785400589748417,Positive
https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/scitech/science/738324/oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-found-protective-in-small-monkey-study/story/,Oxford coronavirus vaccine found 'protective' in small monkey study,JULIE STEENHUYSEN,2020-05-15 02:06:00,"A closely watched coronavirus vaccine being developed by scientists at Oxford University appears protective in a small study of six monkeys, promising findings that led to the start of human trials late last month, US and British researchers reported on Thursday.
The preliminary findings, which have not undergone rigorous review by other scientists, appeared on the preprint server bioRxiv on Thursday.
British drugmaker AstraZeneca last month announced it had teamed up with researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group and the Jenner Institute, which are developing the vaccine.
According to the report, some of the monkeys given a single shot of the vaccine developed antibodies against the virus within 14 days, and all developed protective antibodies within 28 days, before being exposed to high doses of the virus.
After exposure, the vaccine appeared to prevent damage to the lungs and kept the virus from making copies of itself there, but the virus was still actively replicating in the nose.

Stephen Evans, a professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the monkey data were “very definitely” good news.
“It is one of the hurdles to be passed by the Oxford vaccine and it has cleared it well,” he said in an emailed comment.
Although success in monkeys is seen as a key step, many vaccines that protect monkeys in the lab ultimately fail to protect humans.
Evans said one key finding was particularly reassuring – that there was no evidence of immune-enhanced disease, in which instead of protecting against a virus, a vaccine actually makes the disease worse.
“This was a definite theoretical concern for a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 and finding no evidence for it in this study is very encouraging,” he said.
Last month, British researchers started dosing human volunteers with the vaccine in a small safety trial, making it one of only a handful to have reached that milestone. As of May 13, 1,000 people have received the vaccine, the researchers said.
Other vaccines in human trials include those by Moderna Inc , Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE and China's CanSino Biologics Inc.
Globally, there are more than 100 experimental vaccines under development to fight the new coronavirus that has so far infected 4.39 million people and killed 296,847.
A vaccine that protects people from the coronavirus could end the pandemic, but finding one that works and manufacturing enough doses is a huge challenge.
Normally, it can take up to 10 years to develop a working vaccine, but the urgency of the pandemic has resulted in accelerated timelines, and some officials estimate a working vaccine could be available for emergency use as early as this fall. -- Reuters",GMA News,3.0,0.9890999794006348,"say, vaccine, dose, health, also, country, government, first, trial, get","['closely', 'watch', 'coronavirus', 'develop', 'scientist', 'oxford_university', 'appear', 'protective', 'small', 'study', 'monkey', 'promise', 'finding', 'lead', 'start', 'human', 'trial', 'late', 'last', 'month', 'british', 'researcher', 'report', 'thursday', 'preliminary', 'finding', 'undergo', 'rigorous', 'review', 'scientist', 'appear', 'preprint', 'server', 'biorxiv', 'thursday', 'british', 'drugmaker', 'astrazeneca', 'last', 'month', 'announce', 'team', 'researcher', 'group', 'jenner', 'institute', 'develop', 'accord', 'report', 'monkey', 'give', 'single', 'shot', 'develop', 'antibody', 'virus', 'day', 'develop', 'protective', 'antibody', 'day', 'expose', 'high', 'dose', 'virus', 'exposure', 'appear', 'prevent', 'damage', 'lung', 'keep', 'virus', 'make', 'copy', 'virus', 'still', 'actively', 'replicate', 'nose', 'story', 'vatican', 'introduce', 'temperature', 'check', 'peter', 'basilica', 'sanofi', 'ceo', 'pledge', 'virus', 'french', 'backlash', 'wto', 'chief', 'azevedo', 'step', 'year', 'early', 'professor', 'london', 'school', 'hygiene', 'say', 'monkey', 'datum', 'definitely', 'good', 'hurdle', 'pass', 'oxford', 'clear', 'well', 'say', 'email', 'comment', 'success', 'monkey', 'see', 'key', 'step', 'many', 'vaccine', 'protect', 'monkey', 'lab', 'ultimately', 'fail', 'protect', 'human', 'evans', 'say', 'key', 'finding', 'particularly', 'reassuring', 'evidence', 'immune', 'enhance', 'disease', 'instead', 'protect', 'virus', 'actually', 'make', 'disease', 'bad', 'definite', 'theoretical', 'concern', 'find', 'evidence', 'study', 'encouraging', 'say', 'last', 'month', 'british', 'researcher', 'start', 'dose', 'human', 'volunteer', 'small', 'safety', 'trial', 'make', 'handful', 'reach', 'milestone', 'people', 'receive', 'researcher', 'say', 'vaccine', 'human', 'trial', 'include', 'moderna', 'inc', 'pfizer', 'inc', 'chinas', 'cansino_biologic', 'inc', 'globally', 'experimental', 'vaccine', 'development', 'fight', 'new', 'coronavirus', 'far', 'infect', 'people', 'kill', 'protect', 'people', 'coronavirus', 'end', 'pandemic', 'find', 'work', 'manufacture', 'enough', 'dose', 'huge', 'challenge', 'normally', 'take', 'year', 'develop', 'work', 'urgency', 'pandemic', 'result', 'accelerated', 'timeline', 'official', 'estimate', 'work', 'available', 'early', 'fall', 'reuters']",0.9655,0.079,0.739,0.182,0.31958522098056985,Positive

""We will not allow any trial if there is no preliminary proof of efficacy and safety... Ang layunin ng Phase 1 and Phase 2 is more of safety. Pag nakitang safe doon pa lang gagawa ng Phase 3,"" he added.
Sputnik V will likely be available for commercial use in the Philippines by April 2021, according to Philippine Council for Health Research executive director Dr. Jaime Montoya as Russia's FDA is seen to approve it this coming January.
For now, Russia plans enlisting 10,000 individuals in four countries —UAE, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and the Philippines—for the Phase 3 of the clinical trials for Sputnik V and around 1,000 Filipinos are expected to join.

In a non-commissioned poll conducted from September 17 to 20, the SWS asked 1,249 adult Filipinos whether they think a vaccine and medicine to treat COVID-19 will become available in the next 12 months.
80 percent of the respondents said they expect a vaccine to be rolled out in the next 12 months while 17 percent said they do not see it happening soon.
Similarly, 80 percent of those surveyed said a medicine to treat COVID-19 will likely become available in the next 12 months while 17 percent said they do not expect it to happen.
The proportion of Filipinos who expect a vaccine and treatment for COVID-19 to be out by next year was highest in Metro Manila at 85 percent, followed by Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
The expectations for the roll out of a COVID-19 vaccine and medicine are also significantly higher among more educated groups.
Eighty-one percent each of college graduates and high school graduates see a COVID-19 vaccine soon, compared to only 68 percent of non-elementary graduates.
Eighty-two percent of college graduates and 80 percent each of elementary and high school graduates expect a treatment for COVID-19 by next year, while only 70 percent expected the same among non-elementary graduates.
The expectations for a COVID-19 vaccine and medicine by 2021 were also higher among those aged 18 to 44 compared to those 45 years old and above.
Expectations did not vary significantly between men and women.
More Pinoys than Americans see COVID-19 vaccine by 2021
The SWS said its poll questions were patterned after an April-May survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in the United States.
The US poll found that 73 percent of Americans expect a COVID-19 vaccine in 2021, 26 percent do not see it happening, and 3 percent said it will definitely not happen.
However, there was hardly a difference in the number of Americans and Filipinos who said they expect a COVID-19 treatment to be out in the next 12 months.
The US survey found that 83 percent of Americans said a treatment for COVID-19 will likely be out next year, 16 percent do not expect the same to happen, and 2 percent said it will definitely not happen soon.

Ltd. had expressed interest in conducting a clinical trial of a potential vaccine against COVID-19 in the Philippines, Secretary Fortunato dela Peña of the Department of Science of Technology (DOST) said Monday.
“This is fresh information, I just got informed before the opening of the interview [today],” dela Peña said during a Foreign Correspondents of the Philippines (FOCAP) forum.
“The available information passed on to me do not have the full details [yet], but Vaxine has expressed interest in conducting clinical trial and manufacturing [of a vaccine against COVID-19] in the Philippines,” dela Peña added.
Based on the COVID-19 vaccine tracker of The New York Times, Vaxine “developed a vaccine that combines viral proteins with an adjuvant that stimulates the immune system” and its Phase 1 clinical trial began in the middle of this year.
Earlier, the Vaccine Expert Panel (VEP) under the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) had cleared Chinese biopharmaceutical company Sinovac's vaccine for COVID-19 clinical trials in the Philippines.

""A vaccine that has 90 percent efficacy and is pretty safe, that is a historic breakthrough,"" the head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), Thomas Cueni, said.
American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech announced Monday that their vaccine had proven 90 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 infections in ongoing Phase 3 trials involving more than 40,000 people.
""This was the best science news of the year,"" IFPMA's director general told AFP in an interview.
Hopes are also high that one or several of the vaccines under development will also help rein in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed nearly 1.3 million people out of the over 51.5 million infected.
There are currently more than 40 candidate vaccines against COVID-19 being tested on humans, with a handful in the most advanced Phase 3 trials.
Cueni acknowledged that more data was needed on the Pfizer and BioNTech candidate, which is based on an innovative technology that has never been approved for use before.
The companies based their announcement on interim results from the last step in their clinical trial before officially applying for approval.
'Reason for optimism'
Cueni voiced confidence that any major safety concerns with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine would have been known.
""We still need to see the [full] efficacy and the safety data,"" Cueni said, but stressed: ""There is now genuine reason for optimism that these vaccines are basically considered safe.""
He said there is still a long list of unknowns about the vaccine's protection, including whether it will be equally effective in all age groups and how long the protection might last.
Another pressing question is whether it will not only protect a person from COVID-19 infection but also prevent that person from transmitting the virus.
But Cueni said the data so far indicated the vaccine candidate was far more effective in preventing COVID-19 infections than the 50-percent efficacy threshold required by some regulators before considering authorisation.
This was ""big news,"" he said, particularly ""since I think there is reason to hope it won't be the only one.""
""We will see more good results.""
Cueni said safety and efficacy data on at least four other vaccine candidates, being developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax and Johnson & Johnson, would be known within the next few months.
Vaccine hesitancy
He was optimistic that enough data would soon be available to win approval for using one or more of the COVID-19 vaccines.
And the large developers had already scaled up their manufacturing capacities, and were each in a position to produce upwards of a billion doses next year, he said.
But Cueni acknowledged there were numerous logistical challenges to actually inoculating the huge numbers of people it would take to bring the pandemic to a halt.
And he voiced concern about high levels of vaccine hesitancy in many countries.
Pharmaceutical companies were taking that challenge particularly seriously, he said, insisting they were going ""way above and beyond the normal regulatory requirements"" in terms transparency and data-sharing from trials.
The industry understood the importance of ensuring any authorized vaccine is trusted, he said.
""This is not only about COVID-19.""

However, experts said the trials were too small to prove safety and effectiveness.
Russia announced last month that its vaccine, named ""Sputnik V"" after the Soviet-era satellite that was the first launched into space in 1957, had already received approval.
This raised concerns among Western scientists over a lack of safety data, with some warning that moving too quickly on a vaccine could be dangerous.
Russia denounced criticism as an attempt to undermine Moscow's research.

In the Lancet study, Russian researchers reported on two small trials, each involving 38 healthy adults aged between 18 and 60, who were given a two-part immunisation. 
Each participant was given a dose of the first part of the vaccine and then given a booster with the second part 21 days later.
They were monitored over 42 days and all developed antibodies within the first three weeks.  
The report said the data showed that the vaccine was ""safe, well tolerated, and does not cause serious adverse events in healthy adult volunteers"".
The trials were open label and not randomised, meaning there was no placebo and the participants knew they were receiving the vaccine and were not randomly assigned to different treatment groups.  
Researchers underlined that larger and longer trials -- including a placebo comparison -- would be needed to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of the vaccine for preventing Covid-19 infection.
The report said the 76 participants of these trials would be monitored up to 180 days, adding that a more rigorous phase 3 clinical trial was planned with the involvement of 40,000 volunteers ""from different age and risk groups"".
- 'Safety is paramount' -
Naor Bar-Zeev of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who was not involved in the study, said the research was ""encouraging but small"", adding that it did not give any data on effectiveness among older age groups, who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.
""Showing safety will be crucial with Covid-19 vaccines, not only for vaccine acceptance but also for trust in vaccination broadly,"" he said in a commentary in the Lancet. 
""Since vaccines are given to healthy people and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially to everyone after approval following phase 3 trials, safety is paramount.""
The pandemic has seen an unprecedented mobilisation of funding and research to rush through a vaccine that can protect billions of people worldwide.
This week the US urged states to get ready for a potential Covid-19 vaccine rollout two days before the presidential election in November, sparking concerns President Donald Trump's administration is accelerating research to fit a political timetable.
Russia has said that industrial production of its version is expected from September.
President Vladimir Putin said in early August that the vaccine gave ""sustainable immunity"" and that one of his own daughters had been inoculated, even though Russia's health ministry said clinical trials were not yet complete.
The World Health Organization has urged Russia to follow established guidelines and go ""through all the stages"" necessary to develop a safe vaccine.

“We view this as a positive development as this means that more Filipinos trust the current government’s vaccination program,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said.
“We, however, hope there will be a significant increase in the number of Filipinos willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine as President Rodrigo Roa Duterte wants all Filipinos to get vaccines, with priority given to the poor, indigents and other vulnerable sectors,” he added.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said Friday that the government plans to cover around 50% to 60% of the population for the vaccination program.

Epidemiologist Dr. John Wong, member of a subgroup of the government’s inter-agency COVID-19 task force, said Filipinos must continue to practice social distancing, proper hand hygiene, and frequent cleaning to combat COVID-19 even after quarantine.
“We still cannot say that we have won the battle against COVID until we have a vaccine,” he said.
“When we relax [the quarantine], we will see another surge of cases, maybe a third wave. Pero to prevent the third wave, we have to observe all the mitigation measures,” he added.
Wong earlier reported that the curve of COVID-19 infections in the Philippines was flattening at a “dramatic” rate, especially in Metro Manila where nearly 70 percent of cases have been recorded.

He noted that the case doubling time nationwide had slowed to 4.6 days from the baseline of 2.5 days.
“When we say that we’re flattening the curve it means that every day we’re getting fewer and fewer cases… It also means that the number of deaths we have every day is getting fewer and fewer,” he explained.
Despite this, he underscored that the coronavirus pandemic will only end once a vaccine has been discovered.
The World Health Organization earlier said various countries are now exploring six candidate vaccines for COVID-19. 
“We’re protecting each other by self-quarantining at home. But once [quarantine] is relaxed… we have to remember that we have to protect ourselves, protect our family and protect each other,” Wong said.

“Nagpaabot na ng kanilang interes ang ating pamahalaan na baka bumili ng mga vaccine na ito kung ito ay mapatunayang ligtas at mabisa,” Lagdameo said at a televised briefing.
Lagdameo’s statement comes after pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca agreed to supply Europe with up to 400 million doses of Oxford’s COVID-19 vaccine, with deliveries starting by the end of the year.
The company also had similar agreements with the UK, United States, and other organizations.
Last month, the university announced the start of phase 2/3 clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine AZD1222 involving some 10,000 people in the UK.
“The clinical studies are progressing very well and we are now initiating studies to evaluate how well the vaccine induces immune responses in older adults, and to test whether it can provide protection in the wider population,” professor Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, had said.
There is no cure or vaccine yet for COVID-19, which has killed 453,000 people, including at least 1,100 in the Philippines.

According to the SII, the NVX?CoV2373 it is developing with US biotech Novovax will allow handling “in an unfrozen, liquid formulation that can be stored at 2°C to 8°C.”
“For tropical countries like the Philippines, the storage requirement of the Novavax vaccine that doesn’t require extreme cold is an edge,” Dr. Luningning Villa, Faberco Life sciences Inc. medical director, said in a statement.
American firm Moderna's vaccine can also be stored under standard refrigerator temperatures of 2°C to 8°C for 30 days and it can be stored for up to 6 months at -20°C.
Meanwhile, Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine, another American firm, requires ultracold storage of -70°C to -80°C. This makes its distribution challenging for countries with a tropical climate and limited storage resources such as the Philippines.

On Wednesday, Senator Pia Cayetano said that the Department of Health’s (DOH) proposed P212.7-billion budget for 2021 does not cover the cost of the storage and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
When sought for clarification, the Department of Budget and Management said that the DOH “still has to determine the costing particularly for the storage facilities.”
Health Undersecretary Carol Taiño previously said the warehousing allocation under the 2021 budget was not intended specifically for the COVID-19 vaccine.
However, the DOH previously said that it is eyeing to establish cold storage facilities in every province in the country to ensure the effectiveness of the vaccine.

Its initial aim is to deliver two billion doses of safe and effective vaccines to all participating countries by the end of 2021.
Duterte also lauded a UN fund aimed at helping low- and middle-income countries respond to the pandemic.
""As a middle-income country whose economic advances have been derailed by the pandemic, we welcome the launch of the UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund. Ensuring universal access to anti-COVID-19 technologies and products is pivotal in the global pandemic recovery,"" he said.

There are currently no vaccines to prevent the coronavirus that has infected more than 9 million people and killed over 469,000 globally, and only a couple of medicines that have demonstrated benefit in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in clinical trials.

Moderna Inc, the University of Oxford in collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc, and an alliance of BioNTech and Pfizer Inc grabbed headlines by moving to human trials as early as March.
Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson said the firsts in the race now were not assured of securing victory.
""There are companies moving faster, but let us be brutally clear, speed has three downsides,"" he said of competition.
""They are using existing work, in many cases done for SARS; it is likely not to be as efficacious; and there is no guarantee on supply in large volumes,"" Hudson said.
The probability of success for Sanofi is ""higher than anybody else,"" the CEO said.

  The comments echoed those of GSK, whose chief medical officer for vaccines told Reuters on Friday the company was aiming at quality before speed.
Sanofi, whose Pasteur vaccines division has a long established reputation, notably in flu, is currently working on two vaccine projects.
One uses an adjuvant made by GSK to potentially boost its efficacy. It has received financial support from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).
The other, being developed with US company Translate Bio Inc, relies on a different technology known as mRNA, similar to the Moderna approach.
Clinical trials of the vaccine developed with GSK, described as a recombinant vaccine because of the use of GSK's boosting adjuvant, are to start in September.
Trials of the mRNA vaccine candidate should begin around the end of the year, the company said.
Sanofi said it had capacity to produce up to 1 billion doses a year of its recombinant vaccine, and that it would be able to supply up to 360 million doses of its mRNA vaccine annually.
In April, Sanofi said it had manufacturing capacity for 600 million doses for its recombinant vaccine, with the ambition to double production by mid-2021.
The company also said it would expand its collaboration with Translate Bio on developing vaccines, in a deal which will give the U.S. group $425 million in upfront payments. —Reuters",GMA News,2.0,0.836899995803833,"say, vaccine, health, dose, first, government, trial, country, world, ng","['paris', 'french', 'drugmaker', 'sanofi', 'sa', 'say', 'tuesday', 'expect', 'get', 'approval', 'potential', 'develop', 'britain', 'glaxosmithkline', 'plc', 'first', 'half', 'fast', 'previously', 'anticipate', 'sanofi', 'host', 'virtual', 'research', 'development', 'event', 'gsk', 'say', 'successful', 'available', 'second', 'half', 'guide', 'dialogue', 'regulatory', 'authority', 'sanofi', 'research', 'chief', 'john', 'ask', 'accelerated', 'time', 'frame', 'currently', 'vaccine', 'prevent', 'coronavirus', 'infect', 'people', 'kill', 'globally', 'couple', 'medicine', 'demonstrate', 'benefit', 'hospitalize', 'patient', 'clinical_trial', 'many', 'drugmaker', 'race', 'come', 'safe', 'effective', 'produce', 'large_scale', 'story', 'need', 'replace', 'cimatu', 'chief', 'task', 'palace', 'dole', 'eye', 'overseas', 'burial', 'ofws', 'die', 'due', 'saudi', 'arabia', 'semi', 'lockdown', 'employee', 'test', 'positive', 'moderna', 'inc', 'university', 'oxford', 'collaboration', 'astrazeneca', 'plc', 'alliance', 'biontech', 'inc', 'grab', 'headline', 'move', 'human', 'trial', 'early', 'march', 'sanofi', 'hudson', 'say', 'first', 'race', 'assure', 'secure', 'victory', 'company', 'move', 'fast', 'let', 'brutally', 'clear', 'speed', 'downside', 'say', 'competition', 'use', 'exist', 'work', 'many', 'case', 'do', 'sar', 'likely', 'efficacious', 'guarantee', 'supply', 'large', 'volume', 'hudson', 'say', 'probability', 'success', 'sanofi', 'high', 'else', 'ceo', 'say', 'logo', 'sanofi', 'see', 'company', 'headquarters', 'paris', 'france', 'reuters', 'charles', 'file', 'photo', 'comment', 'echo', 'gsk', 'chief', 'medical', 'officer', 'vaccine', 'told_reuter', 'friday', 'company', 'aim', 'quality', 'speed', 'sanofi', 'pasteur', 'vaccine', 'division', 'long', 'establish', 'reputation', 'notably', 'flu', 'currently', 'work', 'project', 'use', 'adjuvant', 'make', 'gsk', 'potentially', 'boost', 'efficacy', 'receive', 'financial', 'support', 'biomedical', 'advanced', 'research', 'development', 'authority', 'barda', 'develop', 'company', 'translate', 'bio', 'inc', 'rely', 'different', 'technology', 'know', 'mrna', 'similar', 'moderna', 'approach', 'clinical_trial', 'develop', 'gsk', 'describe', 'recombinant', 'use', 'gsk', 'boost', 'adjuvant', 'start', 'september', 'trial', 'mrna', 'candidate', 'begin', 'end', 'year', 'company', 'say', 'sanofi', 'say', 'capacity', 'produce', 'dose', 'year', 'recombinant', 'able', 'supply', 'dose', 'mrna', 'annually', 'sanofi', 'say', 'manufacturing', 'capacity', 'dose', 'recombinant', 'ambition', 'double', 'production', 'mid', 'company', 'also', 'say', 'expand', 'collaboration', 'translate', 'bio', 'develop', 'vaccine', 'deal', 'give', 'group', 'upfront', 'payment', 'reuters']",0.9764,0.056,0.786,0.158,0.4053506493506493,Positive

""We confirm the MHRA's [Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency] rolling review of our potential COVID-19 vaccine,"" an AstraZeneca spokesman said.
In rolling reviews, regulators are able to see clinical data in real time and have dialogue with drug makers on manufacturing processes and trials to accelerate the approval process.
The approach is designed to speed up evaluations of promising drugs or vaccines during a public health emergency.
AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine is being developed along with the University of Oxford. Bloomberg reported on Friday that MHRA had also begun an accelerated review for the COVID-19 vaccine candidate from Pfizer Inc.

AstraZeneca and Pfizer are among the frontrunners in the race to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, with the race also including Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc . Their vaccine candidates are in late-stage trials, interim data from which are expected in the coming weeks.
The British drug maker said on Monday its COVID-19 experimental vaccine produces an immune response in both old and young adults. The vaccine also triggers lower adverse responses among the elderly, it said.
The novel coronavirus has killed more than 1.19 million people globally, damaged the world economy and turned normal life upside down for billions of people.

The study, backed by the US government, involves about 1,000 adults.
The results were published on the medical website medRxiv in advance of peer review.
Of the several hundred participants with data available for the interim analysis, the results showed that 98% had neutralizing antibodies, which defend cells from pathogens, 29 days after vaccination.
However, immune response results were available from only 15 participants over age 65, leaving open the question of whether elderly people, one of the populations most at risk, will be protected as effectively as others.

In participants older than 65, the rate of adverse reactions such as fatigue and muscle aches was 36%, much lower than the 64% seen in younger participants, the results showed, suggesting the immune response in older people may not be as strong.
The researchers said more details on safety and effectiveness will follow when the study is completed.
But there were no serious side effects, and based on the results so far, J&J kicked off a 60,000-person trial of the vaccine on Wednesday.
A single shot, versus a rival two-dose approach being tested by Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, could simplify distribution of the vaccine.
COVID-19 burden on US minorities extends to children
Minority groups in the United States are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, and the disparities extend to children, doctors in Washington reported Thursday in the journal Pediatrics.
In March and April, they tested 1,000 children for the novel coronavirus.
Overall, roughly one in five children tested positive.
But while 7% of white children tested positive, 30% of Black children and 46% of Hispanic children did so.
After accounting for age, sex and family income, compared to white children, Black children had more than twice the odds of a positive COVID-19 test, and Hispanic had more than six times the odds.
Black and Hispanic children were also far more likely to have been exposed to someone with COVID-19.
The study could not identify causes of these disparities.
But study co-author Monika Goyal of Children's National Health System in Washington told Reuters the differences ""appear to be driven by greater exposure to the virus. There's nothing to indicate any type of genetic predisposition to COVID-19 based on race or ethnicity.""
In many minority families, parents or caregivers may not have the luxury of telecommuting or staying home from work if they are sick, Goyal said, adding, ""Our societal structures and policies that differentially impact communities based on economic and racial/ethnic lines in turn impact health outcomes.

In a television interview, Remulla said the local government has identified the high-risk individuals who would join the trials, including policemen, drivers of public transport vehicles, factory workers, and senior citizens

""It's not Cavite per se but Cavite and La Salle HSI, the medical school. They have a very good track record in epidemiology and they're the ones being tasked to join in this medical trial. Cavite will help La Salle HSI in getting the high-risk people in joining the vaccine trial. It should start in the next two weeks,"" Remulla told ANC.

Earlier, Remulla said at least 10,000 Cavite residents are set to be subjected to a Phase 3 field trial of two pharmaceutical companies for a COVID-19 vaccine.

He said the residents would undergo swab testing first before being subjected to clinical trials.

He also said choosing those who would be part of the trials is not focused in one barangay but the entire Cavite province.

Remulla also said it would take a month to know the result of the medical trials.

Asked if the matter has been coordinated with the Department of Health, Remulla said it was La Salle who coordinated with the health agency.

""I've been very clear, it's spearheaded by La Salle. La Salle has been in coordination with DOH but La Salle cannot do it on its own so they're partnering with us,"" the governor said.—AOL, GMA News
