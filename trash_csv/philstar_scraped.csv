It's just a matter of waiting for Pfizer to deliver the vaccine. Let's just wait,"" Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told radio station dzBB.      Nograles, also the co-chairman of the government's pandemic task force, said the administration is negotiating with different parties for the vaccine procurement given the supply limitations. He noted that the government has also secured vaccines manufactured by Chinese drug maker Sinovac and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. The government will also negotiate with the Serum Institute of India for the procurement of Novavax jabs and additional AstraZeneca shots.""What is good about our vaccine roll-out plan is we are not dependent on just one brand. We understood early on that there are supply concerns worldwide,"" Nograles said.      ""We are not just dependent on western countries. We are also looking at Asian countries,"" he added.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. previously said the bulk of Pfizer vaccines may not arrive in the Philippines anytime soon because of high demand.Nograles thanked Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez for his efforts to secure vaccines, noting that Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson have committed to allocate supplies to the Philippines.""These two brands are included in the seven brands we are looking at. More brands may be added...We have a good mix because we have western and Asian brands. As the whole world is scrambling for supplies, we have talked to some parties,"" the Cabinet secretary said in Filipino. &nbsp;A total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac jabs and 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca shots were turned over to the Philippines last week. Another 38,400 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines that were acquired through the COVAX facility were expected to arrive last night.Nograles assured the public that the vaccine priority list would be followed during the roll-out of the AstraZeneca shots. He said the inclusion of non-medical personnel during the start of the vaccination program, including some high-ranking officials, was just a ""miscommunication.""We're really sticking to the priority list. We have a good set-up and we have the NITAG (National Immunization Technical Advisory Group)... and they recommend to the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases) who should be prioritized. Whatever the NITAG recommends, we stick to it,"" he said.""I don't want to preempt the results of the investigation but like I said before... based on the preliminary assessment, it seems that there was a (miscommunication) but there was no intention to jump the line but we're sticking to that queue,"" he added.Under the government's priority list, medical frontliners should be the first to be immunized, followed by senior citizens, frontline personnel in essential sectors, indigent population, other government workers, other essential workers, socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigenous people, overseas Filipino workers, other remaining work force, and the rest of the Filipino population.&nbsp;"

""We remain committed to making our vaccine available on every continent to help end this global pandemic.”      Taken in two doses, Moderna has reported a 94% efficacy rate for its candidate vaccine. It was approved for emergency use by US regulators in late 2020 and was the jab that America's top infectious disease expert Dr.&nbsp;Anthony Fauci received in December of last year.Apart from the agreed 13 million doses, officials said a separate deal for another 7 million is also anticipated, bringing the total allocation to 20 million as said by Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez Saturday.The development marks a crucial step in the country's vaccination efforts and in turn, on government's bid to inoculate 50 to 70 million this year alone.A supply deal, however, is still different from a purchase agreement. Last month, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said government has signed supply deals with five manufacturers that he did not name.But nothing on procurement has been made final to date, and the jabs that the Philippines have received so far are donations such as Beijing's Sinovac and the Astrazeneca doses from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility."

But it potentially also is a moment where we lose concentration,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference.“I really am very concerned that... we think we’re through this. We’re not.      “And countries are going to lurch back into third and fourth surges if we’re not careful.“We should not waste the hope that vaccines bring... by dropping our guard in other areas.”WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the first full week of the COVAX roll-out, but said wealthy countries were nonetheless still leaving others behind in the vaccination rush.Within Africa, Angola, the DR Congo, The Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan and Uganda have now received their first doses through COVAX.Elsewhere, Cambodia, Colombia, India, Moldova, the&nbsp;Philippines&nbsp;and South Korea have also taken deliveries.“In the next week, COVAX will deliver 14.4 million doses to a further 31 countries. That brings the total number of countries to 51,” said Tedros.“This is encouraging progress, but the volume of doses being distributed through COVAX is still relatively small.”He said the first round of allocations, running until the end of May, only covered between two and three percent of the population in recipient states, “even as other countries make rapid progress towards vaccinating their entire population within the next few months.”He called for vaccine production to be urgently ramped up, including through linking manufacturers with rival companies that have spare capacity.Tedros also said the planet would be feeling the mental scars from the pandemic for years to come and said the scale of its impact would be worse than during the recovery from World War II.“The whole world is affected. Each and every individual. That means mass trauma which is beyond proportion. Even bigger than what the world experienced after the Second World War,” he said.“And when there is mass trauma it affects communities for many years to come. Countries have to see it as such and prepare for that. Mass, mass trauma.”Brazil fearsMeanwhile Tedros voiced alarm about the coronavirus situation in Brazil, where cases and deaths have shot up, bucking the global trend.He said that in the week beginning Nov. 2, there were 114,000 new cases in Brazil – a figure that hit 374,000 in the week of Feb. 22.Tedros said the number of deaths had also shot up from 2,500 to 8,000 over the same time period.“The situation is very serious and we’re very concerned, and the public health measures that Brazil takes should be aggressive while also rolling out vaccines,” he said. “Brazil has to take this very, very seriously.”He said that because Brazil bordered so many other countries, the situation there threatened the entire South American continent.Ryan said the P1 variant – which has now been found in 29 countries – had become dominant in Brazil, adding to its woes.He said basic public health measures were still the “best bet” in trying to control case numbers.“Our risk, to an extent, is still in our hands,” Ryan said.But he added that it was very hard in countries like Brazil with large urban populations to take measures like physical distancing and mask-wearing “where they don’t have the resources to do that without the support of the state.”"

She said teachers in the province have mixed reactions about the vaccine and there are those who are hesitant to get vaccinated.""Naa pud, natural feelings labi na naa kay existing nga mga sakit… kuan sila, apprehensive what might be the effect kung naa, unya naa ko ani nga sakit… Pero naa po’y isog naa pod uban ganahan,"" Andales told reporters at the sidelines of the Enhanced Countryside Development (ECD) program launched by the Cebu Provincial Government in Pinamunganan town, on March 5.      With the national government looking at easing more restrictions as the vaccination program rolls out, Andales said they have identified 12 public schools in different local government units where limited face-to-face classes may be piloted.The list, though, is still being finalized, as there are schools that have backed out after their LGU recorded cases recently.""Sa ilang place sauna, wala to sila, COVID-free, but because nisulat sila nga increasing ilahang COVID cases, so ni-decline sila to be a pilot school sa limited face to face,"" Andales said.She said DepEd is drafting the guidelines in the implementation of the face-to-face classes so that transition will be easier once President Rodrigo Duterte gives the go signal.More AstraZenecaMeanwhile, more doses of the COVID-19 shot developed by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca with the University of Oxford, will arrive in the Philippines tonight, said vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said.Galvez said 38,400 doses of the jab would arrive at around 7 p.m. on board a commercial plane.These doses form part of the World Health Organization-led COVAX Facility’s pledge to initially deliver 525,600 doses to the Philippines as part of its commitment to give the country a total of 4.5 million doses of the shot by May.Malacañang announced initially that all 525,600 doses would arrive on March 1, only for this to be delayed to March 4 due to supply and logistical problems, which resulted in only 487,200 doses landing in the country.Speaking to health workers at the Ospital ng Parañaque, Galvez said all 525,600 doses did not arrive at the same time because a commercial plane was used for its delivery.The Philippines expects to receive up to 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine this year through the COVAX facility, which ensures that developing countries get access to the coveted drug.The doses from the COVAX facility is on top of the 17 million procured by the national government, local governments and the private sector, which are expected to arrive later this year.AstraZeneca’s shot, which has secured emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration, is found to be 70 percent effective on average and only need to be stored at standard fridge temperatures of 2°C.A member of the private research firm OCTA warned, however, that the shot’s efficacy could decrease to just 10 percent against the new coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa — 58 cases of which have already been detected in the Philippines.The health department sought to soothe those fears, saying that the studies cited only used a small sample of individuals, although it did say that the variant from South Africa, known as B.1.351, “may have an impact on vaccine efficacy.”The World Health Organization (WHO) stands by the use of AstraZeneca vaccine after a preliminary study suggested the jab offered less protection against B.1.351.ModernaAside from the AstraZeneca vaccine, about 20 million doses from US biotechnology company Moderna are expected by the end of May or early June, Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez said Saturday.The Moderna vaccine has, so far, shown a 94 percent efficacy, higher than either that of Sinovac or AstraZeneca which arrived in the past week.At a Laging Handa briefing, Romualdez said the Philippines is also likely to get 117,000 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine from the COVAX Facility, initiated by WHO.American company Johnson and Johnson has also allocated six million of its COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines, he added.Overall, the Philippines is expected to receive over 40 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the US and the United Kingdom this year, Romualdez and British Ambassador Daniel Pruce said in separate interviews.- Philstar.com, JMO (FREEMAN)"

Dizon, who is also the country’s testing czar, said hospitals that received donated Sinovac jabs will also receive AstraZeneca shots.“They will also receive [AstraZeneca] because both will be rolled out simultaneously based on the order of the president so medical frontliners will have a choice,” he said.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said the government aims to vaccinate between 1.7 million and 2 million health workers by end-March. But it faces challenges not limited to the stock of the coveted jabs but also the reluctance of the public to get inoculated.“So every vaccine that comes in, regardless of brand, would be for them. So hopefully by end of March or April, we could vaccinate all our healthcare workers,” Dizon said.&nbsp;The government is eyeing to administer the AstraZeneca vaccine to elderly medical personnel. Sinovac, the only vaccine currently being rolled out, is only recommended by the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group for people aged between 18 and 59 years.The World Health Organization stands by the use of AstraZeneca vaccine despite a preliminary study suggesting the jab offered less protection against the variant first seen in South Africa, its representative to the Philippines said Thursday.

We are going in circles. This is the only thing that will stop the cycle of COVID.”When they first made a survey on who were willing to get inoculated with CoronaVac, QCGH director Josephine Sabando said only three out of over 1,000 personnel answered in the affirmative.Most of the hospital employees were willing to wait for other vaccine brands, Sabando said.Mayor Joy Belmonte admitted that she was initially dismayed when she heard that only a handful were willing to receive the vaccine developed by Sinovac, which was granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.Belmonte lauded Sabando for convincing more medical personnel to get vaccinated with Sinovac.Sabando said 300 doses of Sinovac received by Quezon City have been allocated, with more on the waitlist.The hospital director said she organized town hall meetings where she presented data about the efficacy of Coronavac, especially for severe COVID cases.“It prevents mild cases of COVID-19 by 50.4 percent. For moderate, it is 78 percent. But for severe, it is 100 percent similar to AstraZeneca,” Sabando said.“With this vaccine, we are preventing moderate to severe cases among our healthcare workers. Once vaccinated, there will be almost complete protection from hospitalization, intubation, even death,” she added.Sabando underscored the importance of vaccinating health workers as soon as possible, citing the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila.Belmonte expressed gratitude to the frontline workers who consented to receive the China-made vaccine.“This is a milestone in our COVID-19 response. We have begun the vaccination starting with our health workers,” she said.“I want our doctors and healthcare workers to be protected in any way possible. This vaccine is the best right now considering that this is what is available to us,” she added.The QCGH targets to inoculate 100 people per day."

However, the availability of vaccines will significantly affect the road to economic recovery.“Risks of a prolonged pandemic are tempered by vaccine developments and rollouts though progress on this front varies across economies,” Asakawa said.      “COVID-19 vaccines give us hope that we can gradually turn the tide and rebuild our economies,” he said.Vaccine rollout in the Philippines, however, was the last to materialize in the Southeast Asian region.As of March 3, only 756 doses have been administered in the country, or 0.0002 percent of the 265 million doses globally. It is miles away from the vaccination progress in its ASEAN neighbors like Indonesia which has so far rolled out 2.69 million doses, Myanmar with 104,664 doses and Cambodia 33,211 doses.Generally, developing Asia is much behind in vaccination compared to the US and Europe. ADB principal health specialist Eduardo Banzon said a lot of factors can explain the slow progress.“There’s problem on cold chain logistics for the vaccines and this is adult vaccination. Most of the countries are used to childhood vaccination, it’s a little different now,” Banzon said.“It’s a campaign type and shifting to campaign mode for the next six months or so would be challenging. Vaccine hesitance is a problem but not a problem that cannot be solved,” he said.ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada, for his part, emphasized that vaccine rollouts – from procurement to deployment to confirmation of effectiveness – will shape every country’s reopening and recovery this year.“Vaccine roll out is very critical in deciding and reopening of each country,” Sawada said.Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Harry Roque denied insinuation by administration critics that President Duterte was setting the bar low when the latter said the country would achieve normalcy only by 2023. “Well, you know that going back to normalcy is anyone’s guess,” he said.He explained the President’s statement was logical since some experts have said that the country might attain “herd immunity” only a year after a vaccination kickoff.He said if the country completes its vaccination program this year, it will only be by 2022 that herd immunity could be established to signal a return to normalcy.Roque said the government is working doublly hard to restore the public’s faith in the vaccine and the economy.“I don’t think there is a chilling effect on consumption. Why? As the President has said a vaccination program will only have to take off and attract many people for him to decide on opening everything,” he said. – Christina Mendez"

Perhaps he wants to see a more massive rollout,” Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said.Simultaneous vaccine rollouts would be held in the Cordilleras, Ilocos, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Western Visayas and Eastern Visayas on Monday.

Loosening restrictionsAnd because of the expected arrival of vaccines from both the COVAX facility and Chinese drug-maker Sinovac, Nograles added that it’s possible to place the entire country under the most lenient modified general community quarantine or MGCQ.Around 9,077 persons have received vaccines in 10 Metro Manila hospitals so far, with the government allotting 3.7 million vaccine doses solely for healthcare workers.The Armed Forces of the Philippines confirmed that 2,290 military health personnel have been inoculated in five sites during the first four days of vaccination.For the Philippine Coast Guard, commodores Fran Eden and Luz Escarilla, the first women doctors to reach the rank, expressed willingness to receive the Sinovac vaccine.AdChoicesADVERTISINGBreach in protocolMeanwhile, Malacañang admitted yesterday that protocols were breached when Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority public services head Michael Salalima and Quezon Rep.

Officials initially said 5.5 million of the British-Swedish drugmaker's doses were allocated&nbsp;for the country but this was&nbsp;changed recently per an allocation list published by the WHO.Speaking at a ceremony at the arrival of the vaccines, President Rodrigo Duterte reiterated his call to make the jabs accessible to many countries and encouraged Filipinos to get vaccinated as soon as they can. He also thanked the donor countries, which include members of the European Union, a bloc that he had cursed in the past for alleged interference in domestic issues.      ""I don't know how to express my gratitude to [you],"" he said. ""That you remembered the poor nations is in fact already a plus for humanity..I'd like to say again that we felt the gratitude in our hearts.""""May God bless you for your benevolence,"" he also said.WHO representative in the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe, speaking at the brief ceremony, said that although vaccines have been arriving,&nbsp;preventive measures should not be abandoned. ""Nobody is safe until everyone is safe,"" he also said.The vaccines from the COVAX facility were expected to arrive in February, as the administration sought to give dates that later on turned out to be estimates.AstraZeneca's jabs secured emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration in late January&nbsp;after Pfizer did, and was followed by Sinovac.The government's vaccination program started this week with 600,000 doses donated&nbsp;by Beijing,&nbsp;the first to reach the Philippines last week,Taken in two doses, the AstraZeneca vaccine&nbsp;was found to be 70% effective on average. On Wednesday, however, a member of the OCTA Research team warned that its efficacy rate could decrease to just 10% against the new COVID-19 variant first seen in South Africa that has already been detected in the country.But the health department in a briefing earlier Thursday&nbsp;sought to allay such fears, saying the studies cited had a small sample of individuals.It came as South Africa halted the rollout of AstraZeneca after trials there showed a poor showing against combating the said variant. To which, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vegeire said: ""No matter what the publications say that its efficacy has gone lower, until we are not certain, we will continue to use the vaccines.""The arrival marks an important step in the&nbsp;vaccination efforts in the country, as some health workers — first in line to receive the jabs — sought alternatives to Sinovac.Government said too that medical workers above 60&nbsp;could be prioritized to get Pfizer vaccines, since&nbsp;Sinovac is&nbsp;not recommended for senior citizens.All donations, none boughtCOVAX facility's allocation is different from the direct procurement by government to vaccine manufacturers.The European Union, for one, said it has provided € 2.2 billion to help countries gain access to vaccines, including the Philippines.In a statement, EU's ambassador to the country&nbsp;Luc Véron said the union ""has both a responsibility and interest to make vaccines available for all,"" adding that the union is the ""biggest contributor"" to the COVAX's donation to the country.To date, only term sheets have have been signed, with no purchase deals yet. The supplies from Sinovac and AstraZeneca are also donations.This means that despite officials' repeated pronouncements that the country will have enough supplies this year, the administration has yet to spend the allocated P72.5 billion meant to buy vaccines, funding that is from money borrowed from multilateral sources such as the World Bank."

Abeyasinghe said a proper rollout will also include minimizing wastage of the jabs, as well as ensuring that storage management is done efficently.Line-jumping with smuggled vaccinesMembers of the Presidential Security Group were actually among the first in the country to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. They were vaccinated with&nbsp;unauthorized&nbsp;and smuggled Sinopharm vaccines in late 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte himself disclosed last December.The innoculation mess drew widespread criticism and calls for accountability, but local regulators said their investigation has hit a ""blank wall"" with no cooperation from the PSG. A similar probe into the use of the same smuggled vaccines by columnist Mon Tulfo, ""Cabinet-level"" officials and a senator are similarly likely to go nowhere.Medical experts warned that failing to hold someone responsible for the unauthorized vaccinations&nbsp;could set a bad precedent for bringing in medicines or other vaccines into the country.They also said that justifying the apparent disregard for the law could undermine vaccination efforts in the country, at a time when public mistrust of&nbsp;the jabs has&nbsp;remained high.Health workers are at the top of government's priority list to get the jabs. But only days into vaccinations, incidents of some officials receiving the jabs despite not being on&nbsp;the list have drawn flak.Later on sought for comment, presidential spokesperson in a briefing admitted ""breaches"" into the vaccination program.""Courtesy of these three incidents, everyone should now know that the first vaccines are only for medical frontliners,"" he said partly in Filipino.

Only Sinovac’s CoronaVac has been authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, while Sinopharm’s jab is still being reviewed by the drug regulator.There have been some fears, particularly from opposition lawmakers, that China is deploying vaccine diplomacy, or using its access to vaccines to force countries to bend to its will.Top government officials have downplayed these concerns, with Malacañang even saying that the donations would not affect the country’s territorial claims in the West Philippine Sea.China considers the West Philippine Sea, or the part of the South China Sea within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, as part of its territory despite a 2016 arbitral ruling that held that its territorial claims in the area have no legal basis.It also passed in January a new law that allows Chinese coast guard to fire at foreign vessels and demolish structures built on contested islands, which prompted the Department of Foreign Affairs to lodge a diplomatic protest and the Armed Forces of the Philippines to increase its naval presence in the West Philippine Sea.During the course of his administration, Duterte has made a remarkable pivot to China, warming up ties with the Asian giant.He has also made clear his preference for Chinese vaccines, especially for the still-unauthorized Sinopharm jabs.Smuggled Sinopharm vaccines were used to inoculate members of Duterte’s security group.

Fernandez, meanwhile, was manning the emergency room at the height of the pandemic.Diaz, who made sure hospital staff were fed and sheltered during lockdown when transportation was very minimal in Metro Manila, said she volunteered to get vaccinated to boost the confidence of hospital employees and health workers.Mayor Francis Zamora, who was at the time quarantined at the CSMC after testing positive for COVID-19 on Monday, said an initial 300 doses were expected to be delivered to the hospital yesterday.“The vaccine rollout comes at a very significant time as almost one year ago, March 6, 2020, the DOH confirmed to me that the first local transmission in the Philippines was a patient from Cardinal Santos Medical Center,” he said in a statement sent to reporters.A 62-year-old man from Cainta, Rizal who had not traveled outside the country tested positive for COVID-19 on March 5 last year and was admitted to CSMC, making him the first recorded case of local transmission. His wife also tested positive for COVID-19, making her the second local case.The pair were transferred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for treatment, where they died due to health complications brought by the virus after more than a week of battling the disease.“Now, one year after, our vaccination process has begun, which I believe will be the game changer in our fight against COVID-19,” Zamora added."

The local company also needs to present proof it is the distributor of Sinopharm in the country.&nbsp;   Related Stories      FDA says China's Sinopharm applied for emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine“Once they submit the documents, we will begin the evaluation,” Domingo said in a public briefing Wednesday.&nbsp;      “Until we see scientific evidence, we see the population involved in their Phase 3 clinical trials, their experience in using the vaccine in other countries, that’s the only time we can give recommendation on the use of the vaccine,” he added.The drug regulator confirmed Tuesday the receipt of an online application seeking emergency use authorization for the jab developed by China’s state-owned pharmaceutical company.      Domingo earlier said it may take “around four to six weeks” before the agency can decide on the application because Sinopharm has yet to receive EUA from a stringent regulatory authority or from the World Health Organization. The lack of relevant documents may delay it further.“We’re very objective in approving vaccines. We have a checklist of what we’re looking for: safety, efficacy and quality,” he said.Interim analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials showed that Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine was 79.3% effective in preventing the disease, lower than the reported efficacy rates of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna of 95% and 94.1%, respectively. The data, however, have not been peer-reviewed.So far, only the vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac Biotech have obtained EUAs from the FDA. The application of Russia’s Gamaleya for its COVID-19 vaccine remains pending.The jab developed by Sinopharm is the one preferred by President Rodrigo Duterte.It was the same vaccine used by members of the Presidential Security Group, special envoy to China Mon Tulfo, some “Cabinet-level” officials and a senator in an unauthorized vaccine activity last year.The country began its delayed COVID-19 vaccination campaign Monday, with health workers, government officials and uniformed personnel the first in the line to receive donated Sinovac shots."

Essentially, this means that the P72.5 billion that Congress approved for vaccine&nbsp;purchase has yet to be spent.Officials this week sought to explain that the delay in the jabs' arrival was due to supply shortages and logistical concerns.Dr. Rabindra Abeyashinge, the World Health Organization's representative to the country, told CNN Philippines that bottlenecks are hampering the delivery.&nbsp;This includes drugmakers ""unable to meet manufacturing targets, because these are biological processes, and they couldn't proce the quantities that they anticipated they could early on.""""These vaccines need to be transported,"" he said, ""maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world… Now this is causing a challenge.""Apart from the AstraZeneca, some 117,000 doses of Pfizer was also allocated to the country under the COVAX. But vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. bluntly said the country should not expect anytime soon its arrival as the jabs are in high demand in many countries.The arrival of another brand of a COVID-19 vaccine is now more than ever crucial with inoculations already underway with the Chinese-made Sinovac.Significantly, health workers were the first to receive this, despite the Food and Drug Administration earlier advising against administering it to them, after clinical trials in Brazil showed a lower efficacy rate among those dealing with COVID-19 patients.On March 1, the group Alliance of Health Workers in a protest called on government to give medical personnel ""better options for vaccine that have the highest efficacy rate.""""Many from our ranks have been infected and some died in combating the deadly virus,"" said Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the employees' association at the Lung Center of the Philippines.

Ignoring them in the national efforts to contain COVID-19 will result in failure since the health of prisons and the communities surrounding them are linked.”Penal and detention facilities across the country are known to be overcrowded, where social distancing and proper hygiene—practices meant to deter spread of the novel coronavirus—are practically impossible for inmates.SPECIAL REPORT:&nbsp;Beyond arrest, raps: 'Quarantine violators' face trauma, COVID-19 risk tooDespite earlier claims from the government that inmates are ""safer"" from the threat of the coronavirus inside prisons, both the Bureau of Corrections and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology recorded hundreds of COVID-19 cases&nbsp;since the outbreak in March 2020 — this, despite a lockdown enforced in the facilities.The Supreme Court and the Department of Justice meanwhile crafted&nbsp;policies to help decongest the prisons that allowed the release of thousands of inmates."

So whatever the vaccine (brand is), what’s important is we have the freedom to choose which vaccines we want,” she said, stressing that protection against the disease is better than none.

Pasig began vaccinating health workers yesterday with only half of the 300 initially scheduled vaccine recipients opting to get injected.

Roque said the President also wants to thank the WHO and the United Kingdom for facilitating the procurement of the vaccines, which was made possible through the intercession of British Ambassador Daniel Pruce.Last Sunday, Duterte went out of his way to welcome the Chinese military plane that carried the first 600,000 Sinovac vaccines from Beijing.&nbsp;The Philippines has ordered about one million more vaccines from Sinovac that are expected to arrive within the month.BottlenecksThe shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines is being delayed due to two bottlenecks on the global level, the WHO said yesterday.WHO country representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said the requirements related to AstraZeneca vaccines have already been completed.The Philippines was expecting to receive some 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines last March 1 through the WHO’s COVAX facility, but those did not materialize.Abeyasinghe&nbsp;said the WHO is now looking at how it can “accelerate” the delivery of the vaccines to the country.“That was identified as a tentative date. We are looking at how we can accelerate delivery,” he said in a television interview.The WHO official also underscored that on the global level, they are seeing two bottlenecks for the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccines.First is that pharmaceutical companies could not&nbsp;meet the manufacturing targets for the vaccines.“These are biological processes and they could not produce the quantities they anticipated they could early on,” Abeyasinghe said.The other bottleneck is on the delivery process.“These vaccines need to be transported. Maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world,” Abeyasinghe said.He added that 190 countries have signed up to the COVAX facility, anticipating to receive COVID-19 vaccines.The WHO official said the “consignments are ready and just logistics arrangements are being made.”“So once we have a finalization and a confirmed itinerary of the delivery, we will share that information… I don’t want to create any expectations until we have a firm date,” he added.Sinopharm EUAMeanwhile, Duterte is waiting for the approval of the emergency use application (EUA) of Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm, Malacañang said yesterday.Duterte is a senior citizen, but he is not expected to be among the first to be inoculated in the government’s vaccination program.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend administering Sinovac vaccines – the first COVID-19 shots to arrive in the country – to health workers and senior citizens despite the approval of its EUA. The China-made vaccine posted only a 50.4-percent efficacy rate among health care workers exposed to the coronavirus.Last Monday, Roque said a Palace legal team is studying whether the 75-year-old Duterte can be vaccinated with jabs manufactured by Sinopharm, which has secured a compassionate use license. The issue, however, has become moot and academic because Sinopharm has already applied for EUA, according to the Palace spokesman.“That question is already moot and academic because the President will be waiting for the EUA because I reported yesterday (March 1) that Sinopharm has applied for EUA. He will just wait for the approval of Sinopharm,” Roque said at a press briefing yesterday.In an interview, FDA director general Eric Domingo said Sinopharm submitted an application online Monday afternoon.“We are looking at the documents now to see if the documents are complete or if there are any documents that need to be submitted before we officially accept the application,” Domingo added.In December last year, the Presidential Security Group (PSG) admitted that some of its members had received COVID-19 shots ahead of the FDA’s approval of the local use of COVID-19 vaccines.PSG chief Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III defended the vaccination, saying Duterte’s security aides need to ensure that they do not pose a threat to the President’s health and safety.Last Sunday, Duterte, who has expressed readiness to be vaccinated in public, said he would heed his doctor’s advice on what COVID-19 shot to get.“We have to be careful. I have my own doctor. She thinks that another brand… I will not mention it, I will just wait for it. She is waiting for it,” the President said at a press conference at Villamor Airbase.“On the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage. It is to my self-interest that I should get one. No doubt about it. As to what brand, that’s the problem because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added.Clinical trialsHealth Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire yesterday said Janssen Pharmaceuticals is conducting clinical trials in the country for its two-dose regiment&nbsp;COVID-19 vaccines.Vergeire added that Janssen is looking at the possibility that the two-dose vial is more efficacious against the coronavirus or will give higher immunity.Aside from Janssen, the FDA had also allowed Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals to do clinical trials in the Philippines. – Sheila Crisostomo, Alexis Romero"

It said some employees were told they would be asked to present a certification as proof they have been inoculated with COVID-19 vaccine before they would be allowed to work.Other employees, the ALU said, are being threatened with reassignment and relocation to other branches should they not participate in the company-sponsored immunization program.      “There were employees who were told that they would be put on furlough or floating status until they are injected with the vaccine,” ALU noted.Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez said employees should be given the option to decide and not be required by employers to get vaccinated against COVID.While the employers cannot oblige employees to get inoculated, Lopez said the companies may provide information to help workers in coming&nbsp; up with an informed decision on the vaccines.“Before pandemic, employees have the option themselves to be vaccinated with flu vaccine or any other vaccine. This should not change even with COVID-19,” Lopez said.He said employees should have an option.“Anyway if an employee is not vaccinated, he or she is the one at risk of getting COVID-19,” Lopez said.The labor group said the government should immediately act to prevent the discriminatory and coercive mandatory vaccination in some workplaces.Based on internal surveys initiated by some companies, the ALU said a large number of working people are reluctant to be vaccinated for fear of adverse or side effects.In Iloilo City, the local government intends to enforce a “no vaccine, no work”&nbsp;policy in public and private offices operating in the city, it said.“This mandatory workplace policy is a form of coercion and discrimination, which violates the right of workers to freely decide and chose for themselves, particularly with regards to their health and well-being,” the group said.ALU vice president Gerard Seno said the group is advocating for the vaccination of all&nbsp;workers and pushing for the prioritization of essential workers to be inoculated with safe and effective vaccines.Seno said the decision of any person not be vaccinated should be respected and employers could only persuade employees with the benefits and advantages of being vaccinated.Sen. Joel Villanueva pressed for the immediate vaccination of workers, saying it is the only way for the economy to recover.Villanueva, chair of the Senate labor committee, said he moved for the inclusion of workers in the vaccination program’s priority lane as he knew that unless workers are given back their jobs, the economy will have a difficult time recovering.“We believe that we will be able to recover only if our workers are protected,” Villanueva said in a radio interview.He cited data showing up to 17 million workers lost their jobs at the height of the enhanced community quarantine from March to April.Millions of families suffered economically due to the pandemic, which hit the&nbsp;country in March 2020, he said.P100 wage hikeMeanwhile, labor group Defend Job Philippines yesterday called for an immediate action on the pending petition for a P100 across-the-board wage increase for workers nationwide.“We hope the labor department and the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) will act immediately on our petition as this is an urgent matter for Filipino workers in the wake of a pandemic,” Defend Jobs spokesman Christian Lloyd Magsoy said.NWPC executive director Criselda Sy gave assurance that the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) is acting on the petition filed by Defend Jobs Philippines.“The petition was filed before the RTWPB-NCR. The board is acting on the petition,” Sy said.Magsoy said prices of commodities and services are steadily going up at this time of pandemic, except for the wages of workers.Based on the group’s oil price monitoring, Magsoy said, the costs of gasoline and diesel increased eight times since January this year.“The series of big-time hikes on the costs of oil and petroleum products was an additional burden to the already loaded shoulders of Filipino workers in the light of the consistent price surges of basic commodities and services in this time of a pandemic,” Magsoy said in a statement.He said the government must immediately do something to stop these unlimited oil price hikes.Aside from intervening in the deregulated status of oil pricing in the country, Magsoy said the government should also prioritize and speed up the implementation of a P100 emergency wage relief.The group filed a formal wage petition before the NCR wage board on Monday."

Loreche said that the doses that will not be used in Cebu will be given to other hospital health care workers in the region retained by DOH.Dr. Van Philip Baton, DOH-7 medical coordinator for infectious diseases, called on the public to give the vaccine a chance as it work and proven to be effective, safe, and has saved lives.He said vaccination is the only way for the country to achieve herd immunity once a large portion of the population is inoculated.Dr. Junjie Zuasula, head of DOH-7’s Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, echoed Baton’ statement.“Achieving herd immunity will take time. It will also depend on the supply of vaccines. But one thing is certain – we will achieve herd immunity in due time,” Zuasula said during a forum of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV).Emotional ArrivalRetired Major General Melquiades Feliciano, Visayas implementer of the Inter-Agency Task Force, had volunteered to be vaccinated on March 4.He described the arrival of the vaccine at the Mactan Cebu International Airport as being emotional.“Oo, medyo naging emotional dahil at long last, dumating.

Light at the end of the tunnel.”Feliciano said some doses will be given to workers in other government hospitals and, if there will be doses left, barangay health care workers can benefit.He is hoping that vaccines from AstraZenica will finally arrive in the Philippines.Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales of OPAV said Cabinet members and key IATF officials, including Galvez, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque will be in Cebu tomorrow, March 4.Business SectorBusinessman Kenneth Cobonpue, chairperson of the Regional Development Council in Central Visayas, said the business sector is very eager for the vaccination.Cobonpue said getting people vaccinated is one of the best ways to revive the economy further, especially in Central Visayas where travel and tourism play a huge role in people’s income.But while the vaccines give a glimmer of hope, Loreche reminded the public to still observe minimum health protocols against COVID-19.China DonationSinovac’s CoronaVac is the third COVID-19 vaccine brand, aside from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA).At least 600,000 doses of the Coronavac arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, February 28. The vaccines arrived at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board a Chinese military plane.President Rodrigo Duterte viewed the crate containing the vaccine doses and inspected the actual vaccine vials before the vaccines were transported in at least six 40-footer trucks to cold chain storage facilities that include the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and the Metropac Logistics in Marikina City.In an earlier report, Sinovac is among three vaccines being considered by Cebu City for its own vaccination program alongside Novavax/Covovax and AstraZenica.Novavax has a pending EUA application.The city is no longer considering Pfizer-BioNtech, the first vaccine to be given an EUA in the country, mainly due to storage concerns. — Caecent No ot-Magsumbol, JMO (FREEMAN)"

Sinovac, while also given nod by the Cebu City government, is no longer an option since it is already under the national government’s vaccination program.“With regard to the Sinovac vaccine, since the national government has already purchased the same, the Cebu City government will wait for the guidelines as to how it should be implemented and distributed to the constituents, mindful (of) the latter’s right to choose which vaccine to receive,” part of the resolution states.Rama reiterated that the council is also open to other vaccine brands, such as Pfizer and Moderna, as long as they have secured an EUA, do not need ultra-cold storage, and the price is reasonable.“We are not limiting it to other vaccines if they get the FDA’s EUA. But we have to consider the costs and storage. It’s going to be a nightmare if it needs ultra-storage,” the vice mayor said.The City Council is expected to finalize the number of vaccines to be purchased before entering into a purchase agreement.The city government initially set aside P400 million for the purchase of vaccines against COVID-19.Meanwhile, the council also had initial discussions on the city’s vaccine priorities as well as vaccination sites, vaccinators, and other personnel needed in its vaccination program.The proposed vaccination drive-thru had also been scrapped after Dr. Ilya Abellanosa of the Cebu City Health Department said individuals that have been vaccinated need to be monitored yet for some time before being allowed to go home.Councilor Alvin Dizon also opened up on the possibility of having a “house-to-house” vaccination for seniors and PWDs which Abellanosa said is already being considered in their initial plan. — with Decemay P.

But he stressed there are bottlenecks hampering the delivery of the doses like&nbsp;manufacturers being&nbsp;""unable to meet manufacturing targets, because these are biological processes, and they couldn't&nbsp;produce the quantities that they anticipated they could early on.""Logistics already being arrangedHe also identified logistical challenges as another reason for the delay of the shipment.      “We’re now anticipating a second bottleneck and that is delivery processes. These vaccines need to be transported, maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world… Now this is causing a challenge,” Abeyasinghe said.“My understanding is that the consignments are ready and just the logistics arrangements are being made. So once we have a finalization and a confirmed itinerary for delivery, we will share that information,” he added.Asked if the delayed delivery was due to logistical concerns and not a supply problem, Abeyasinghe responded: “Right now, that’s what we’re made to understand.”Vaccine deliveries to the Philippines are being coordinated by the UNICEF, the WHO official also said.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Monday that there is no definite date yet for the arrival of the AstraZeneca shots but he is hoping the shipment will come before the first quarter ends.Delayed Pfizer shipmentAbeyasinghe said the country’s “access to Pfizer vaccines may be delayed” but he expressed hope that the jabs will come “before the end of the month.”Officials have been saying the supplies of Pfizer shots are in high demand in many countries, with Galvez saying the country should not expect delivery anytime soon.Some 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine were expected to arrive by mid-February but the delivery got delayed. Officials attribute the delay due to the absence of an indemnification program.The Philippines finally kicked off its inoculation drive against COVID-19 Monday, with medical workers, government officials and uniformed personnel among the first in line to receive shots of CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech.But the vaccination campaign faces not only supply problem but also public reluctance to get the critical shots.&nbsp;— Gaea Katreena Cabico"

But she sought to assure that the chances of having adverse effects are only minimal.""Dapat wala tayong ikatakot sa injection...at 'wag matakot magkaroon ng adverse reactions kasi napaka-mild po ng ibibigay na mga reaction nito,"" she said.(We should have nothing to fear for injections, as well as on having adverse reaction because these are only mild.)Government in the recent months up to the first arrival of the vaccines had to struggle with encouraging more Filipinos to receive the jabs, as surveys showed only a few were willing to take it on concerns about&nbsp;safety and efficacy.Some administration officials took the Sinovac in public in a ""symbolic"" vaccination on Monday in a bid to ramp up public confidence on the vaccines. But noticeably, some of those who earlier remarked that they would take the jabs suddenly could no longer take it — such as Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and President Rodrigo Duterte due to old age.&nbsp;— with reports from Gaea Katreena Cabico"

Seno said that employers should only try to persuade employees with the benefits and advantages of being vaccinated, but they should not coerce them to get the shot.ALU said that some factory workers have complained to them about how their superiors have told them that they would not be allowed to report to work unless they participate in the company-sponsored coronavirus vaccination drive.      It added that other business owners have given instructions to supervisors and managers to deem employees who do not get vaccinated against COVID-19 as unfit to work.It also said that another group of employees have been told that they would need to present a certification to prove that they have received a COVID-19 jab before they are allowed to work.Meanwhile, Iloilo City is mulling to mandate all employees in the city to get vaccinated against COVID-19 before they are allowed to work.“Before it becomes a norm, the Department of Labor and Employment must respond quickly to these surfacing abuses and provide immediate protection measure by outlawing these unfair and unjust treatment of employees,” Seno said.While the government targets to inoculate 60 million to 70 million people in the hopes of achieving herd immunity, it is not making COVID-19 vaccines mandatory. — Xave Gregorio"

Officials have defended the use of vaccines not yet authorized by the FDA, saying the President’s official security detail should not pose a threat to his health.The country began its vaccination program yesterday, with the arrival on Sunday of 600,000 doses of donated COVID-19 vaccines developed by Sinovac of China.      Asked whether Duterte, who reportedly prefers Sinopharm vaccines, is covered by the compassionate use license, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the matter is still being studied.“The legal department is still studying the issue, (whether) the President as commander-in-chief of the armed forces can have Sinopharm under compassionate use,” Roque said at a press briefing at the Philippine General Hospital in Manila yesterday.“The study has no result yet and we will announce it once the results are available,” he added.Roque claimed Sinopharm has applied for an emergency use authorization (EUA) but the FDA could not confirm this. “As of Friday, I have not seen anything. I’m not sure if they filed online,” FDA chief Eric Domingo said in a text message.So far, the FDA had granted EUA to Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac.Still under evaluation are the applications of Gamaleya-Sputnik of Russia and Bharat Biotech Covaxin.Speaking to reporters at the Villamor Air Base last Sunday, Duterte said he would follow his doctor’s advice on which COVID-19 vaccine to take.“We (people who are in their 70s) have to be careful. I have my own doctor. She thinks that another brand, I will not mention it, I will just wait for it. She is waiting for it,” the President said at his first press conference since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.“In the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage. It is to my self-interest that I should get one. No doubt about it. As to what brand, that’s the problem because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added.Asked to react to Vice President Leni Robredo’s statement that he should be the first to be inoculated to boost public confidence in the COVID-19 shots, Duterte said: “Siya man ‘yong apurado, siya ang mauna (She’s the one so eager so she should be the first). I cannot just decide. She’s young, I am not.”“Why make a drama out of who should be the first? The problem is my doctor is waiting for something,” he added.Roque said the President would inform the public if he experiences side effects after getting vaccinated.“The President has promised that once he gets inoculated, it (would) be held publicly... Of course, we will inform you about the side effects if any on the President. But since he has not yet received a vaccine, that is moot and academic,” the Palace spokesman said.“Let me clarify. What is stated in the Constitution is the President has the obligation to make public his medical condition only if he has a serious illness,” he added.Duterte said health workers who do not want Sinovac vaccines can wait for the AstraZeneca shots expected within this month.“They have a choice, it’s either... AstraZeneca or Sinovac. If they do not want Sinovac, they have to wait... I was assured that it would be coming within the next few days,” the President said.Duterte stressed there would be no forced vaccination.“Now, for those who do not want to be vaccinated, that’s OK with me. I have no problem. You do not want vaccines? OK, that’s your choice,” he added.Sen. Bong Go said key government officials have asked to be vaccinated first so they could inspire confidence in the vaccines and not because they are priority.“It’s not a question anymore if the President is willing to be vaccinated in public or not because we all want to be vaccinated. We are doing this not because we are the priority. We will do this to show the public that we should trust the vaccine,” Go said.Go also expressed his willingness to be vaccinated in public together with Duterte to demonstrate the vaccines’ safety and efficacy. Go chairs the Senate committee on health and demography.Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said they haven’t received any complaint from military personnel regarding their mandatory COVID-19 vaccination.“It’s not true that many are complaining. If they don’t want Sinovac they will still be vaccinated by other brands. And if there are no free doses available, they will have to pay for them,” he told reporters in English and Filipino.AFP chief of staff Lt. Gen.

I did not feel it when I was being vaccinated,” he said in an interview, adding that a few hours after receiving the vaccine, he still could not feel anything even on the injection site.“Of course I have to monitor myself in the next 24 hours… But (so far), I do not feel soreness and systemic symptoms like fever,” Domingo said.At 52 years and being a health care worker, he noted that he fits the criteria for Sinovac vaccinees.Meanwhile, members of the Alliance of Health Workers at LCP staged a “lunch break” to denounce what they called government’s “consistent inconsistencies” in the vaccination program against COVID-19.The group’s president, Robert Mendoza, said they are “dismayed at the sudden turnaround decision of the government to inoculate health care workers (HCWs) with Sinovac”?as this is “sacrificing the health and safety of the health workers.”He added that the government is “practically forcing HCWs to accept Sinovac vaccines, called CoronaVac.”Eleazar Sobinsky, LCP Employees Association president, said HCWs deserve the best vaccine against the novel virus as their “health and lives are always at stake.”Sobinsky stressed that it would not be enough for the government to simply indemnify health care workers “who will suffer severe side effects or death due to the COVID-19 vaccines.”“We want the government and health authorities to be held accountable in indemnifying victims of severe effects of the vaccine,” he added.Fr. Marlito Ocon, one of the chaplains at PGH, said he preferred to wait for other anti-COVID vaccines to arrive and have options as he expressed his belief that both patients and frontliners should wait for what they deem as the “best vaccine” against the coronavirus.“I’d rather wait for the best one if there are other (brands) that are coming… It is not as if that (Sinovac) is the only vaccine that would arrive in the country or that is the only vaccine available so we have to take the risk for the sake also of the people we serve, our patients and to all frontliners who are here at the hospital,” Ocon told the Catholic church-run Radio Veritas.He revealed that during a meeting with the Department of Health (DOH) at PGH last Sunday, a survey conducted by the hospital that showed 95 percent were against being vaccinated with Sinovac was mentioned.One common reason for this is that they would no longer be able to avail themselves of other vaccines brands if they get inoculated with CoronaVac. – Sheila Crisostomo, Evelyn Macairan"
