C.: United States President Joe Biden’s massive relief plan is on track to cross the finish line on Wednesday (Thursday in Manila) with a final House vote, stimulating an economy digging out from the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and offering a lifeline for millions of families. The $1.9-trillion package, broadly popular with Americans and approved by the Senate over the weekend, is expected to narrowly clear Congress days before a crucial deadline, culminating a weeks-long negotiation over its cost and scope. If it reaches his desk, Biden — who made the American Rescue Plan his top legislative priority — could sign the historic bill into law by week’s end. But the plan that funds Covid-19 vaccines, preserves unemployment benefits for millions, and sends relief checks of up to $1,400 to most Americans can afford very few Democratic defections. All Republicans are in lockstep against the package, and Democrats enjoy the smallest majority in years in the 435-seat House of Representatives. A Tuesday vote laying out the parameters of the next day’s action on the bill augured its narrow path to success. The tally was 219 to 210 in favor of proceeding, with no
Republicans in support and one Democrat joining their party in opposition. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said he was “110 percent” confident the bill will pass. In an effort to drive home how this sweeping package helps the economy, Biden on Tuesday visited a business billed as Washington’s oldest hardware store, which has benefitted from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) begun under Donald Trump’s administration to help businesses stay afloat during the crisis. “We’re going to continue this,” Biden said of the PPP as he chatted with store owner Mike Siegel. The president took a jab at Trump, though, saying that “a lot of money went to people who shouldn’t have gotten help” through the PPP because some of the beneficiary companies were too large and therefore not supposed to qualify. Biden’s administration will tailor the program so that it focuses on businesses with 20 employees or fewer, he said. Left-wing Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted “Finally, our government is responding to the pain of working people.” The last congressional plan to fight the coronavirus, which has to date left more than 527,000 dead in the United States and brought the economy to its knees, was enacted in December. It expanded unemployment payments by $300 a week, and extended them through March 14. That deadline has loomed as Biden and congressional Democrats crafted their latest package, but it appears they will meet it and extend the benefits until early September. “It’s a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters.",Manila Times

Debold Sinas on Wednesday directed all police units to strictly enforce public health guidelines amid the rising cases of Covid-19. The PNP chief also appealed to the public anew for greater awareness and cooperation in the implementation and observance of health protocols. “We cannot afford to lower our guard against the virus, especially at this point when the cure is already within reach,” Sinas said. He added that the police force “will remain vigilant in enforcing public health guidelines and local ordinances that seek to mitigate the effects of the pandemic that has so far infected 600,000 Filipinos, 12,000 of whom have died due to medical complications.” Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros, meanwhile, rejected the proposal to deploy military and police personnel to arrest individuals who breach health protocols. The senator deplored “the militaristic approach” to the pandemic, saying it was “a repeat of the mistakes of the past.” She said it would only delay the swift response needed to deal with the rise in cases which the World Health Organization (WHO) said might require the country to return to a stricter lockdown like in July 2020. “What is this, throwback to 2020?” asked Hontiveros. She noted that during the world’s longest lockdown, police arrested 76,000 people for breaching health protocols from March to July last year. “The cases did not go down and only overwhelmed health workers that they had to beg for a 2-week circuit-breaker,” the senator said in a statement. She lamented that deploying uniformed personnel was an ineffective and anti-poor strategy. She cited the case of the five youths arrested in Laguna at the start of the lockdown who were detained in a dog cage. “There is a way to enforce stricter health protocols humanely and non-violently. It’s 2021 already. Let’s do this the right way,” Hontiveros said. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, on the other hand, said civilians should also do their part “by cooperating with lawful instructions and following the proper health protocols.” “This is the key to minimizing the spread of the coronavirus. We are under a state of public health emergency by virtue of Presidential Proclamation 922,” Lacson said. “The country is still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, there is a noticeable spike in the past few days, and the government must use its police power under the Constitution to make sure that the further spread of the virus is prevented or controlled,” he added.

Malaya said the DILG deployed 180 policemen in Pasay City, reportedly experiencing a surge in virus cases, to enforce health and safety protocols to stop Covid-19 from fanning out.

WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe. PHOTO BY J. GERARD SEGUIA According to WHO Country Representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the LGUs should lead in the effort on early detection, quarantine and granular lockdowns to prevent increase in cases that may lead to a regional community lockdown just like last year. “We need to go back to ensuring that public- health measures are fully implemented and that the authorities fully implement the early detection, early quarantining, isolation of cases and, if necessary, limited lockdowns in [villages] with clustering of such cases to prevent further spread,” Abeyasinghe said in a news briefing on Tuesday. The Department of Health (DoH) on Monday blamed an increase in the number of cases in the country on the public’s noncompliance with the minimum health standards, an uptick that was aggravated by the presence of the B117 or the United Kingdom variant and the B1351 or the South African variant of the virus. Both variants have higher transmission rates and, in the case of the South African variant, may affect the efficacy of vaccines being rolled out globally. Abeyasinghe said the WHO is carefully monitoring the variants that have spread across the globe by working with different research institutions to understand how they act. He added that the current increase in the number of cases does not constitute a “second wave” of infection, as the region did not experience a true “flattening of the curve” or a decrease in the number of cases specifically in the National Capital Region (NCR or Metro Manila). “I would not classify this as a second wave… We should have seen a flattening of the curve and in the case of NCR, we did not see a flattening. We always knew that there is a thick chain of transmission although the numbers went down…. [there] were still significant
levels of transmission in the community,” Abeyasinghe said. He added that determination of community transmission of the variants is not possible because of the limited number of variants and that the testing for the variants remains expensive. “The number of variants confirmed is limited…. With limited testing for variants being done, the key issue is interpreting the findings and doing representative sampling and that is what we are doing with the DoH to strengthen, as it is not possible in an economic standpoint variant genome sequencing for every Covid patient,” Abeyasinghe said. On Tuesday, the country logged 2,668 new cases of Covid-19, pushing the total number of infections to 600,428.",Manila Times

The vaccines developed by Novavax and AstraZeneca are being manufactured by Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer. An early data readout in January from its United Kingdom trial showed the vaccine to be around 96 percent effective against the original coronavirus and around 86 percent effective against the now widely circulating variant first discovered in Britain. Novavax completed enrollment of its 30,000-subject, US-based trial in February.

Those who are fully vaccinated can also visit with unvaccinated people from one other household indoors without masks or distancing so long as the unvaccinated people are not at high risk for severe Covid-19, added CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. Fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who has Covid-19 also won’t need to take a test or quarantine unless they show symptoms — unless they live in a congregate setting like a nursing home or correctional facility. The recommendations came as US states were moving to reopen schools and businesses amid a drop in cases. Some 59 million Americans have now received one or more vaccine doses — about 23 percent of the adult population — and the immunization rate has been steadily rising after a shaky start. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a two-dose series, like the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two weeks after a single-dose vaccine like Johnson & Johnson’s. Two women wearing face masks as a protection against the coronavirus disease take a selfie during snowfall in central Moscow on March 8, 2021. AFP PHOTO While the new guidance will come as welcome news, particularly for the elderly who are now free to visit with their healthy children and grandchildren, many restrictions have not changed. The CDC continues to recommend that fully-vaccinated people wear masks and maintain social distancing in public, or in indoor gatherings involving people from more than one household. And the new guidance does not apply to meetings with people who have underlying conditions that place them at higher risk for severe Covid. The health agency also continues to recommend against attending larger gatherings and advises against domestic or foreign travel. Scientists are now very confident that authorized Covid vaccines protect people against severe disease and death. There is also growing evidence that they stop infections — though probably not at the same rate as they stop disease — but more research is needed to get a firmer idea.  ",Manila Times

Calalo,2021-03-06,"Metro LGUs lauded for fast rollout of, increased confidence in vaccines of health workers","METRO Manila’s local government units (LGUs) have effectively and swiftly carried out the rollout and deployment of vaccines in their respective hospitals that led to increased confidence among medical frontliners. Undersecretary Bernardo Florece Jr., officer-in-charge of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), said in a statement that the LGUs’ preparation in coordination with the Department of Health (DoH) and compliance with the national deployment and vaccination plan played a key role in the success of the start of the roll-out. “A few days since the vaccination program began, we have seen the significant increase in vaccine confidence among health care workers with some hospitals even running out of stocks,” Florece said. “The local hospitals conducted town halls among their medical workers, conducted simulations, and did an inventory of their resources, so when the roll-out began, they were prepared and there were generally no hitches,” the DILG acting secretary added. Congratulating the LGUs for the good start, Florece said that the greater challenge will come in the next few months when inoculations will begin among the senior citizens and indigent groups. “But the LGUs have shown that it can be done properly and fast,” he said. LGU hospitals that were the first batch to begin inoculation include Pasig City General Hospital, San Ana Hospital, Pasay City General Hospital, Quezon City General Hospital, Taguig-Pateros District Hospital, Ospital ng Muntinlupa, Tondo Medical Center, Valenzuela Medical Center and Ospital ng Makati. In Parañaque City, the vaccination rollout commenced last Friday as 50 health workers from the Ospital ng Parañaque received their first dose of CoronaVac, the vaccine manufactured by China’s Sinovac Biotech. Among the first to get the jabs were hospital director Dr. Jefferson Pagsisihan and Parañaque’s chief of clinics Dr. Patrick Ismael Dela Cruz 2. Malabon City also started its vaccination rollout at the Ospital ng Malabon (OsMal) and the first to be vaccinated was OsMal chief Dr. Mitzi Tanchoco. Health workers in Caloocan City also got their jabs of Sinovac’s Covid-19 vaccine as the vaccination rollout commenced at the Caloocan City Medical Center where a total of 149 health workers agreed to get vaccinated. In Makati City, the local government said that its 300 doses of Sinovac vaccine were all administered to health workers of the Ospital ng Makati (OsMak) with the hospital director, Dr. Vergel Binay, being the first health worker to be administered the vaccine. Mandaluyong City Medical Center, Navotas City Hospital, Novaliches District Hospital, San Juan Medical Center have also begun their inoculations.

Valente, TMT",2021-03-06,"Galvez: Covid-19 vaccines delivered in March, April still for health workers","IN a bid to protect and preserve the country’s health care system amid the health crisis, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. assured the public that all jabs for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) to be delivered this March and April would be “specifically allocated” to health care workers. In a statement, Galvez said the government would prioritize health workers in its vaccination efforts until two million of them have received shots to protect them from the virus. “All vaccine supplies that we have received and will be delivered this month are specifically allocated to all health care workers from all regions across the country,” Galvez said. “Initial deliveries for April will also follow this allocation until we have completely inoculated nearly two million individuals under this sector,” he added. Galvez made the statement as he assured the public that the priority framework of the vaccination rollout of the Covid-19 jabs would be strictly followed. He explained that due to the limited supply of vaccines and recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, along with the directive of President Rodrigo Duterte, the allocation of Covid-19 jabs should follow the priority framework issued by the country’s inter-agency task force focused on the coronavirus response. “The framework prioritizes medical frontliners and healthcare workers to be followed by our senior citizens and other sectors. This prioritization primarily ensures that we will be able to protect and preserve our healthcare system as we continue to battle this pandemic,” he said. Galvez said the prioritization of health care workers was emphasized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of the Philippines’ agreement in procuring 44 million doses of Covid-19 shots from the Covax Facility, an initiative focused to provide equitable access to vaccines and which the agency is a leader of. On Thursday, a total of 487,200 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca arrived in the country. The WHO said that 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine would arrive in the country in batches before the end of May. “All the doses from Covax must first be administered to the agreed upon priority groups starting with health care workers . Giving the vaccines to other sectors when not all health care workers have been vaccinated will jeopardize succeeding deliveries from Covax,” Galvez said. Succeeding sectors in the priority list, including those who will participate in boosting public trust in the vaccination campaign, will be served once the country receives the vaccine supplies for the second and third quarters of the year, according to Galvez. “We remind our countrymen especially our co-workers in government that in these trying times, it is our moral obligation to ensure that our healthcare system is protected and will be able to withstand possible spikes in Covid-19 cases,” Galvez said. “By respecting and following the priority framework, we will be able to reduce Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, protect the populations most at-risk to the disease, slow down the transmission rate, and minimize social and economic disruptions. We need to preserve our healthcare institution,” he added. Galvez thanked government officials, civil society organizations, and other personalities for volunteering to get inoculated in public to boost the people’s trust and confidence in the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. “We value your support and appreciate your intention to help us boost the people’s confidence in the vaccines even as volunteering to take the jab in public,” the vaccine czar said. “Indeed, seeing our leaders getting inoculated will significantly affect the perception and decision of our countrymen on the vaccine program,” he added. Amid the continued rise in coronavirus cases, the government is targeting to give free inoculations to 70 million Filipinos to reach herd immunity. Meanwhile, one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Sinovac that the Philippines purchased will arrive in the third week of March. The Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer under the Covax facility may arrive in the country in April. The first batch of 20 million doses of Moderna Covid-19 vaccines will arrive in the Philippines by June.",Manila Times

REUTERS posted on March 3 a must-read report on the pandemic that surveys how virus variants are impacting the views of scientists on Covid-19, and the vaccine rollout in various countries. As reported by Julie Steenhuysen and Kate Kelland, Reuters provides a revealing update on the battle between scientists and SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. I reproduce their report in full: “Chris Murray, a University of Washington disease expert whose projections on Covid-19 infections and deaths are closely followed worldwide, is changing his assumptions about the course of the pandemic. “Murray had, until recently, been hopeful that the discovery of several effective vaccines could help countries achieve herd immunity, or nearly eliminate transmission through a combination of inoculation and previous infection. But in the last month, data from a vaccine trial in South Africa showed not only that a rapidly spreading coronavirus variant could dampen the effect of the vaccine, [but] it could also evade natural immunity in people who had been previously infected. “‘I couldn’t sleep’ after seeing the data, Murray, director of the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told Reuters. ‘When will it end?’ he asked himself, referring to the pandemic. He is currently updating his model to account for variants’ ability to escape natural immunity and expects to provide new projections as early as this week. New consensus
“A new consensus is emerging among scientists, according to Reuters interviews with 18 specialists who closely track the pandemic or are working to curb its impact. Many described how the breakthrough late last year of two vaccines with around 95 percent efficacy against Covid-19 had initially sparked hope that the virus could be largely contained, similar to the way measles has been. “But, they say, data in recent weeks on new variants from South Africa and Brazil have undercut that optimism. They now believe that SARS-CoV-2 will not only remain with us as an endemic virus, continuing to circulate in communities, but will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come. “As a result, the scientists said, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask-wearing and avoiding crowded places during Covid-19 surges, especially for people at high risk. “Even after vaccination, ‘I still would want to wear a mask if there was a variant out there,’ Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said in an interview. ‘All you need is one little flick of a variant (sparking) another surge, and there goes your prediction’ about when life gets back to normal. “Some scientists, including Murray, acknowledge that the outlook could improve. The new vaccines, which have been developed at record speed, still appear to prevent hospitalizations and death even when new variants are the cause of infection. Many vaccine developers are working on booster shots and new inoculations that could preserve a high level of efficacy against the variants. And scientists say there is still much to be learned about the immune system’s ability to combat the virus. “Already, Covid-19 infection rates have declined in many countries since the start of 2021, with some dramatic reductions in severe illness and hospitalizations among the first groups of people to be vaccinated. Worse than flu
“Murray said if the South African variant, or similar mutants, continue to spread rapidly, the number of Covid-19 cases resulting in hospitalization or death this coming winter could be four times higher than the flu. The rough estimate assumes a 65 percent effective vaccine given to half of a country’s population. In a worst-case scenario, that could represent as many as 200,000 US deaths related to Covid-19 over the winter period, based on federal government estimates of annual flu fatalities. “His institute’s current forecast, which runs to June 1, assumes there will be an additional 62,000 US deaths and 690,000 global deaths from Covid-19 by that point. The model includes assumptions about vaccination rates as well as the transmissibility of the South African and Brazilian variants. “The shift in thinking among scientists has influenced more cautious government statements about when the pandemic will end. Britain last week said it expects a slow emergence from one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, despite having one of the fastest vaccination drives. “US government predictions of a return to a more normal lifestyle have been repeatedly pushed back, most recently from late summer to Christmas, and then to March 2022. Israel issues “Green Pass” immunity documents to people who have recovered from Covid-19 or been vaccinated, allowing them back into hotels or theaters. The documents are only valid for six months because it’s not clear how long immunity will last. “‘What does it mean to be past the emergency phase of this pandemic?’ said Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. While some experts have asked whether countries could completely eradicate any case of Covid-19 through vaccines and stringent lockdowns, Baral sees the goals as more modest, but still meaningful. ‘In my mind, it’s that hospitals aren’t full, the ICUs aren’t full, and people aren’t tragically passing,’ he said. Scientific whiplash
“From the beginning, the new coronavirus has been a moving target. “Early in the pandemic, leading scientists warned that the virus could become endemic and ‘may never go away,’ including Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program. “Yet they had much to learn, including whether it would be possible to develop a vaccine against the virus and how quickly it would mutate. Would it be more like measles, which can be kept almost entirely at bay in communities with high rates of inoculation, or flu, which infects millions globally each year? “For much of 2020, many scientists were surprised and reassured that the coronavirus had not changed significantly enough to become more transmissible, or deadly. “A major breakthrough came in November 2020. Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE as well as Moderna Inc said their vaccines were around 95 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 in clinical trials, an efficacy rate that is much higher than any flu shot. “At least a few of the scientists Reuters interviewed said even in the wake of those results, they hadn’t expected the vaccines to wipe out the virus. But many told Reuters that the data raised hope within the scientific community that it would be possible to virtually eliminate Covid-19, if only the world could be vaccinated quickly enough. “‘We all felt quite optimistic before Christmas with those first vaccines,’ said Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London. ‘We didn’t necessarily expect such high-efficacy vaccines to be possible in that first generation.’ “The optimism proved short-lived. In late December, the UK warned of a new, more transmissible variant that was quickly becoming the dominant form of the coronavirus in the country. Around the same time, researchers learned of the impact of the faster-spreading variants in South Africa and in Brazil. “Phil Dormitzer, a top vaccine scientist at Pfizer, told Reuters in November that the US drugmaker’s vaccine success signaled the virus was ‘vulnerable to immunization’ in what he called ‘a breakthrough for humanity.’ By early January, he acknowledged the variants heralded ‘a new chapter’ in which companies will have to constantly monitor for mutations that could dampen the effect of vaccines. “In late January, the impact on vaccines became even clearer. Novavax’s clinical trial data showed its vaccine was 89 percent effective in a UK trial, but just 50 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 in South Africa. That was followed a week later by data showing the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine offered only limited protection from mild disease against the South African variant. “The most recent change of heart was considerable, several of the scientists told Reuters. Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, described it as ‘scientific whiplash’: In December, he had believed it was plausible to achieve so-called ‘functional eradication’ of the coronavirus, similar to measles. “Now, ‘getting as many people vaccinated as possible is still the same answer and the same path forward as it was on December 1 or January 1,’ Crotty said, ‘but the expected outcome isn’t the same.’” My only comment on this is that the cost of vaccinating 50 to 70 percent of a country’s population is unrealistic and prohibitive, particularly if its economy has been shattered by the pandemic and the lockdowns. Vaccinating all humanity must wait until pharmaceutical companies can produce as many vaccines as there are people. Economists must take the field as resolutely as the scientists. yenobserver@gmail.com",Manila Times

I stared at Martin Luther King Jr.’s simple monument in awe, and began to recall his legacy. Michael King Jr.
He was born Michael King Jr. on Jan. 15, 1929 in Atlanta and was assassinated on April 4, 1968 in Memphis. As a Baptist minister and social activist, he led the US civil rights movement from the mid-1950s to 1968. In 1964, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. While in a Connecticut tobacco farm, he saw that the races peacefully mixed in the North. In the South, racial segregation was the norm. He wrote to his parents, “Negroes and whites go to the same church. I never thought that a person of my race could eat anywhere.” On Dec. 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger. Parks was arrested for violating the segregation law. King called for the boycott of the transit system. In 1963, he landed in the Birmingham jail for leading more protests. On Aug. 28, 1963, he made his iconic “I Have a Dream” speech in a peaceful interracial assembly of some 250,000 people in front of the Lincoln Memorial. In another protest, King also said, “We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.” King was not the first to say that. America’s 30th President, from 1923 to 1929, once said, “No matter by what various crafts we came here, we are all now in the same boat.” The same boat
Germany and the United Kingdom were at War in Europe. When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill said to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Now that we are, as you say, ‘in the same boat,’ would it not be wise for us to have another conference … and the sooner the better?” Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, I’ve been hearing public officials say that “we are all in the same boat.” Now, I am not sure if that is true. Gillian Tett wrote in the Financial Times, “The cruelty of Covid-19 is that it has not just exposed existing inequalities, but that it is exacerbating them, too.” Tett also wrote about “the three Bs” among people these days – boredom, burnout, and breakdown. But if you look on the positive side, there is a fourth B – blessings. The pandemic has helped increase fortune for a few, and misfortune for many. In 2013, French economist Thomas Piketty wrote a best-selling book, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century.” He referred to capital as the “sum total of non-human assets” that can be owned or exchanged. He argues that “when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income … capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities.” Piketty’s theory explains what’s unfolding before our eyes during this pandemic. Because of existing monetary policies all over the world, people who hold assets have increased their net worth. Those without assets, particularly the “Ninjas” (No Income, No Job or Assets) have seen how their meager wealth, if you can call it that, has shrunk as the recession has caused massive loss of jobs, wages and purchasing power. Whenever public officials say that we are in the same boat, I think we are missing the point. Do they know that many Filipinos today do not have the luxury of having three meals a day? Or that many households have experienced disconnection of water and electricity supply? Non-economic capital
Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002) was a French sociologist, anthropologist and philosopher who was primarily concerned with the dynamics of power in society. He analyzed the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and maintained across generations. Bourdieu emphasized how social classes, especially the ruling and intellectual classes, preserve their social privileges across generations, despite the myth that “contemporary post-industrial society boasts equality of opportunity and high social mobility, achieved through formal education.” In the 1970s, Bourdieu argued that “capital does not need to be viewed just through the lens of economics.” In his book, “Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste” (1979), he argued that “judgments of taste are related to social position, or more precisely, are themselves acts of social positioning.” Like it or not, capital helps acquire power, and power helps amass capital. They augment each other over time. During a crisis, the power of economic capital tends to immensely reward those with other types of capital as well. People with strong economic, cultural, or social capital are the most resilient in both the real and virtual worlds. Those who do not have these types of capital are worst hit and continue to struggle. Emotional capital is a form of cultural capital. It augurs well for people during crisis situations. According to the UK’s Mental Health Foundation (MHF), people with “pre-existing problems have fared dramatically worse” during the Covid-19 pandemic. The MHF reported that “We are all in the same storm, but we are not all in the same boat. [There is] a divergence in people’s experience depending on their social and/or economic context in society. Differences in mental health impact will persist and likely increase.” Disparities
Here’s the main point: Capital, in economic, emotional, social or cultural form, can provide the needed resilience during crisis situations. If you have capital, you’ll be better off than those who don’t. There will be tragic inequities. There’s no easy way to fix them. From the economic standpoint, increasing inequity will likely drag down productivity. From a political perspective, inequity can engender corrosive bitterness between the haves and have-nots. From a moral perspective, inequity in crisis is wrong and must be abated, if not totally eradicated. As the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact different social classes, governments must employ more innovative ways of collecting and analyzing data to better understand and address growing disparities. This could help reduce barriers and ensure a more efficient and equitable means of addressing problems caused by this pandemic, particularly with regards to testing, tracing, treatment, and vaccine administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC has announced that one of its main thrusts is “equitable distribution of vaccines to all Americans, especially those who are marginalized because of race and ethnic origin and the associated poverty that goes with disparate distribution of wealth.” Civilized societies, like ours, are governed by laws. I think it was the late President Ramon Magsaysay who said these related but separate statements, “He who has less in life should have more in law. The little man is fundamentally entitled to a little bit more food in his stomach, a little more cloth on his back, and a little more roof over his head. … for the government exists for the welfare of the masses of the nation. A high and unwavering sense of morality should pervade all spheres of government activity.” When disease, hunger and despair reign, world governments should truly help the many who are poor. Or else, it might become more difficult to protect the few who are rich.

GERARD SEGUIA Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. made the statement as he assured the public that more than 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccines from the World Health Organization-led Covax facility would arrive this month. Some 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, but the delivery encountered delay due to “supply problems.” “Opo, iyong Covax facility ay inaasahan po natin na mayroon pa tayong 500,000 plus so sigurado po iyan darating ng Marso (Yes, we are expecting 500,000 plus from the COVAX facility and this will surely arrive this March),” Roque said in an interview over dzBB radio, when asked for the status of AstraZeneca vaccine delivery. “At kaya nga po kampante po ang gobyerno na tuluy-tuloy na po ito at sa lalong mabilis na panahon sana matapos po natin ang mga health workers, 3.4 million po iyan at pagkatapos po sana ay mayroon na tayong makuha para sa mga seniors dahil iyon na po ang ating susunod na target ng ating vaccination (That’s why the government is confident that the vaccination will be continuous and as soon as possible, we hope to finish vaccinating our 3.4 million health workers and after them, we hope to get more for the senior citizens because they are the next target of our vaccination),” he added. THE Philippines formally started its vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on Monday, a day after the first 600,000 doses from Chinese firm Sinovac BioTech Ltd. arrived. Roque had hailed the first day of the government’s national Covid-19 vaccination program as “very successful.” He said frontline medical workers who received the vaccine now have “peace of mind” knowing that they have some sort of natural protection against the virus. “Maligaya po ang ating medical front-liners kasi nga po nagkaroon sila ng peace of mind na bagamat sila po’y exposed dito sa coronavirus, ay meron na silang proteksyon ngayon (Our medical front-liners are happy because they can have peace of mind even if they are exposed to Covid-19, they have protection now),” he said. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised against the use of the Sinovac  vaccine for healthcare workers attending to Covid-19 patients because it only has a 50.4 percent efficacy rate based on data from Brazil. However, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group later recommended the use of CoronaVac even for health workers. Meanwhile, millions of doses are expected to arrive in the Philippines soon. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., for one, said a million state-purchased Covid-19 doses are set to arrive this March. Galvez likewise said at least 5.2 million doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines from the  Covax facility are set to arrive in the second quarter. Initial procurements with Novavax and AstraZeneca from the private sector’s end are also expected to reach the country within the period. The government is targeting to inoculate at least 50 million individuals by the end of 2021.

The Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition unveiled an interactive map that shows 1,172 violent acts and attacks occurred against health workers or facilities last year, “a minimum estimate,” according to the NGO. More than a third (412) of the acts are directly related to Covid-19, it said, citing several examples including in Mexico, where a nurse was attacked and injured by a group accusing her of spreading the virus. In Dakar, three social workers had stones hurled at them by residents who refused to have a coronavirus victim buried near their homes. In Birmingham, England, a health worker was spat at and insulted by a neighbor. The vast majority, 80 percent, of the perpetrators of the violence were civilians, but threats also came from public authorities. In Egypt, health workers who criticized the regime’s handling of the pandemic were arrested by security forces and accused of spreading false information and of belonging to a terrorist group. Insecurity Insight, which developed the interactive map, also recorded 802 attacks in countries at war or on victims of civil conflicts, such as the bombing of hospitals in Yemen and the kidnapping of doctors in Nigeria. “The map shows that violence and intimidation against health care was a truly global crisis in 2020, affecting 79 countries,” said Insecurity Insight director Christina Wille in a statement.

Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders. Critics panned the plan as inadequate. Most students in the nation’s most populous state have been learning from home for the past year during the pandemic. But with new coronavirus cases falling rapidly throughout the state, Newsom and lawmakers have been under increasing pressure to come up with a statewide plan aimed at returning students to schools in-person. If approved by the Legislature, the plan announced Monday would not order districts to return students to the classroom and no parents would be compelled to send their kids back to school in-person. Instead, the state would set aside $2 billion to pay districts that get select groups of students into classrooms by the end of the month. Crucially, the legislation does not require districts to have an agreement with teachers’ unions on a plan for in-person instruction. That’s a barrier that many districts, including the nation’s second-largest district in Los Angeles, have not been able to overcome. It also does not require all teachers be vaccinated, as teacher unions had urged and that could take months given the nation’s limited supply of vaccine. The legislation would make it state law that 10 percent of the state’s vaccine supply be set aside specifically for teachers and school staff. “You can’t reopen your economy unless you get your schools reopened for in-person instruction,” said Newsom, who announced the deal with state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon at an elementary school in the Elk Grove Unified School District just south of Sacramento. The district, one of the first in the country to halt in-person learning last year because of the coronavirus, plans to return to in-person instruction later this month. The state’s two largest teachers unions mostly praised the agreement, with California Federation of Teachers President Jeff Freitas calling the prioritization of vaccines for teachers “a huge victory.” Kevin Gordon, a lobbyist representing many of the state’s school districts, called the plan “a grand slam home run,” saying it “dismantled every impediment to reopening that we’ve had so far.” The announcement comes at a critical time for Newsom, who could face a recall election later this year fueled by anger over his response to the pandemic. Kevin Faulconer, the former Republican mayor of San Diego who already has announced his candidacy, said the plan Newsom announced “isn’t even close to good enough for our kids and teachers.” In this Feb. 25, 2021 file photo, Assistant Principal Janette Van Gelderen (left) welcomes students at Newhall Elementary in Santa Clarita, California. AP PHOTO “For months, Newsom has ignored science and left public schools across our state shuttered while private schools are open,” Faulconer said. “For him to tout this as an accomplishment after months of inexcusable failures shows how out of touch he is, and why he should be recalled.” In addition to the $2 billion, the legislation would give all school districts access to $4.6 billion to help students who have struggled with learning from home. Districts could use this money to add another month to the school year or they could spend it on counseling and tutoring for students who need the most help. To get their slice of the $2 billion, districts in counties under the state’s most restrictive set of coronavirus rules — known as the purple tier — must offer in-person learning for transitional kindergarten through second grade, plus certain vulnerable students in all grades. This includes students who are disabled, homeless, in foster care, learning English, don’t have access to technology or are at risk of abuse and neglect. Counties in the next group, known as the red tier, must offer in-person instruction for all elementary school grades, plus at least one grade each in middle and high schools. With new coronavirus cases falling, Newsom said he expects most counties to be in the red tier by the end of the month. Districts that meet the March 31 deadline get full compensation based on a complicated formula, while those that meet the standards after April 1 get less money. Districts that fail to have children back in classrooms before May 15 won’t get any money. The bill does not say how long students must be in the classroom each week. That concerns Jonathan Zachreson, founder of the parent group Reopen California Schools, who says districts could offer classroom instruction for a few hours one day per week and still get the money. He predicted many parents will get excited reading headlines from Monday’s announcement, only to end up frustrated. “It does not compel any school district to open other than just bribing them with extra money,” he said. “We need to have higher standards for what in-person learning means.” Newsom dismissed those concerns, saying he is “confident people won’t be gaming the system that way.” Cecily Myart-Cruz, head of United Teachers Los Angeles, said she worries the state plan would benefit schools in wealthier neighborhoods where the coronavirus is less prevalent. “This would send extra dollars to affluent areas that are able to reopen because of low infection rates, leaving students from low-income communities of color behind,” she said. Megan Bacigalupi, a parent advocate with Open Schools California, said she worried there was no urgency to get middle and high school students back to classrooms, noting the agreement does not require all of those students to return for in-person learning. “Framing this as a reopening deal is blind to the fact that there will be kids that will not be back in school this year,” she said. California Teachers Association President E. Toby Boyd praised the legislation for recognizing the union’s safety concerns, which were broadcast to state residents in television ads that started running last month. But he criticized the plan for only requiring coronavirus testing in schools located in counties where the coronavirus is the most widespread.",Manila Times

Even with the mass inoculation for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) finally underway, the government still has not fully convinced majority of the people to get their shots. Standing in the way are prevailing perceptions about the risks of getting vaccinated and the efficacy of some vaccines. NO FAN OF NEEDLES A personnel at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium in Caloocan City braces for the prick of the needle during the initial inoculation of health workers on March 1, 2021. PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN But a member of the Department of Science and Technology’s Vaccine Expert Panel warned in an online interview with The Manila Times that this was not the time to be choosy when it came to a Covid-19 vaccine because the virus had already mutated. Dr. Nina Gloriani, a microbiologist, believes that any of the three vaccines approved for use in the country is capable of providing protection against infection. Given the green light for emergency use in the Philippines are Pfizer and BioNTech tozinameran’s Cominarty, AstraZeneca’s AZD1222, and Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac.
CoronaVac has the lowest efficacy rate at 61 percent, while Cominarty has the highest at 95 percent. For Gloriani, the detection of Covid-19 variants and mutations in parts of the country means that the government must waste no time in immunizing as many people as it can. The Department of Health plans to vaccinate at least 70 million people before the end of this year to achieve herd immunity, the percentage of the population that has to be vaccinated to reach an acceptable threshold of protection against the virus. “Para sa akin, kung ano ang mauna d’yan, kung high-risk ka for exposure to Covid, you take the vaccine, a 50-percent efficacy is better than zero. Hindi tayo pwedeng mag-wait nang matagal, dahil ang variants nandito na (For me, whatever vaccine is the first to be rolled out and if you have a high-risk exposure to Covid, you have to take it, as a 50-percent efficacy is better than zero; and we cannot wait for too long since the variants are already here),” Gloriani said. The emergence of variants will affect the efficacy of the vaccines, although manufacturers were modifying their vaccine formulations to create booster shots against the mutations, she said. To prevent mutations from affecting vaccine efficacy, the public must continue to practice health precautions such as wearing face masks and face shields, physical distancing and continued hygiene. “Kung ang tao, nag-iingat mabuti, wala nang pupuntahan ang virus kasi ang virus, habang may malilipatan na buhay na cells, dadami s’ya at dadami; at habang siya ay nagre-replicate, mataas ang mutation nya kaya dapat mapigil ang transmission (If people are really being careful, the virus will not be able to transfer itself. So long as it moves to a living cell, it will multiply until it replicates and create a mutation. So, it is imperative that we prevent transmission),” Gloriani said. She added that relying solely on a vaccine’s efficacy rate could be misleading, since the rate could differ widely during clinical trials for a specific sector such as health care workers, adults aged 18 to 59 years old, or senior citizens. “If you test the vaccine in a general population where the exposure to Covid is lower, tataas ang efficacy mo, maiiba iyun,” she explained. Such was the case for the CoronaVac, which posted a 50.4-percent efficacy among health care workers in a clinical trial in Brazil. “At the time of the clinical trial, ang taas ng kaso ng Covid cases sa Brazil…if you are talking about 10,000 na binigyan ng bakuna — kalahati placebo — puro health care workers ‘yun and in a situation na mataas ang cases, mataas din ang possibility or probability na magkaka-Covid sila so mataas ‘yung gan’ung scenario (the Covid cases in Brazil were already high…so if you are talking about the 10,000 people who were given shots — half of which were placebo — all of them were health care workers who were in situations where there prevalent cases, they had a high probability of being infected with Covid, that scenario is hugely [expected]),” Gloriani said. The 50-percent efficacy threshold for Covid vaccines set by the World Health Organization was based on the different attack rates of the virus across the globe. In the end, what counts most is the protection the vaccine provides against the most severe infection. “With a pandemic vaccine, hindi natin expect na mapo-protektahan ang lahat, pati mild, moderate, severe, but what we are after, na ma-protektahan against the severe form of the disease, kasi ayaw natin may mamatay, may ma-critically ill kasi ‘yung health care system, papanik din ang ating resources doon (we still cannot expect to protect everyone, including those with mild, moderate and severe cases, but what we are after is to protect them against the severe form of the disease because we do not want health workers to die or be critically ill and to experience a strain in our health care resources),” Gloriani said.",Manila Times

Every day there is the chance of getting the disease.” FOR SAFEKEEPING A pharmacist stores vials of anti-Covid vaccine at a cold storage machine at the Sta. Ana Hospital inManila on March 1, 2021. Doses of vaccines will be distributed to more hospitals this week. PHOTO BY MIKE ALQUINTO She added that she did not want to wait any longer and wanted to get vaccinated with the first available vaccine that would arrive in the country. “Ayoko nang maghintay (I don’t want to wait); there is always a threat of getting Covid. There is also the threat of dying from Covid, with so many vaccines available. There are many efficacies available, but for preventing them, they are all the same,” she told The Manila Times minutes before she was inoculated. Twenty other medical professionals at the Lung Center received their jabs. Aniceto, who was vaccinated by Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd, joked that being inoculated by the Health chief made her feel like a guinea pig. Aniceto said she listened to infectious disease experts such as Dr. Edsel Maurice Salvana and Dr. Rontgene Solante before deciding to be vaccinated. “They studied all the scientific data and I will trust their judgment is enough to put my faith on. And I am hoping that by being the first one in Lung Center, I hope to give that message to everyone also,” she added. Nursing aide Jove Erdadan, meanwhile, said he wanted to be protected against Covid-19 and that he trusted the vaccine. Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the Lung Center of the Philippines Employees Association,
refused to take any vaccine made in China. He said he would wait for a vaccine made either in Russia or the United States. The police and the military had their own vaccination rollouts, with two persons who received their first doses exhibiting “very mild” reactions. In the military, the first to get the vaccine was Col. Fatima Claire Navarro, commanding officer of the V. Luna Medical Center. Her first dose of CoronaVac was also administered by Duque. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and Quezon City Mayor Josefina Belmonte witnessed the rollout at the V. Luna Medical Center. Navarro said she did not feel any adverse effects afterwards and the injection itself did not cause any pain. “I didn’t feel anything different after the vaccination. No feeling of heaviness, nothing painful and even the injection, there was nothing unusual,” she told reporters. She noted that they had studied all vaccines and their possible reactions and found all of them offered “appropriate” protection from the virus. “Now, what’s important is the timeliness,” Navarro said. “It’s important that we will save our fellow countrymen’s lives, our lives and our family’s lives against Covid-19.” Vaccination for military personnel is mandatory. Those who refuse face sanctions under the Articles of War 105. In Camp Crame, BGen. Luisito Magnaye, head of the Philippine National Police’s Health Services Command, was the first to receive the vaccine. He said he did not feel anything unusual, but pointed out that 24 hours were needed to monitor possible effects. At the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, two hospital personnel were taken to the
emergency room after experiencing “very mild” effects. The two unidentified workers developed rashes, but hospital Director Dominador Chiong said they recovered after receiving medication. Other ranking government officials and health experts who attended the vaccination rollout at PGH also received their shots. Among them was the Department of Health’s Technical Advisory Group member and infectious disease expert Edsel Salvana. “I’m alive! Arm hurts but that’s just my immune cells getting ready to churn out anti-Covid antibodies. [Number] 2 to get vaccinated in the Philippines!” Salvana said on Facebook. Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo was also vaccinated. He said because the syringe was small and the nurses at PGH were experts at inoculation, he hardly felt the shot. Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chief Benhur Abalos was also vaccinated. He said the death of his mother from the virus inspired him to have the inoculation. Corazon Abalos, the wife of former Commission on Elections chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr., died in January. The MMDA chief had also tested positive for the virus, contracting it from his mother. “Don’t let yourself remain unvaccinated. The more individuals who will be inoculated, the earlier our fight against this disease will end,” he said. Manila Mayor Francisco Do-magoso attended the event but did not get a shot, saying health care workers should be prioritized.",Manila Times

Roque gave the assurance as 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the first batch that the Philippines will be receiving from its manufacturer Sinovac Biotech Ltd., and 525,600 doses from British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca through the Covax Facility will be arriving on Sunday and Monday, respectively. It also came a day after health personnel from the Philippine General Hospital protested against the government plan to inoculate them with the Chinese-made vaccine and demanded that they be given “the safest dose” with the “highest efficacy rate” although they did not name a specific brand. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) had approved the recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and the Department of Health’s Technical Advisory Group to allow the administration of Sinovac vaccines to frontline medical workers. The IATF-EID’s approval comes despite results of clinical trials showing that the Sinovac vaccine only has a 50.4-percent efficacy rate among health care workers exposed to Covid-19. The Palace official clarified that the new rule would only apply to health care workers because of the condition stipulated in the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued to Sinovac. “Pang-health care workers lang po iyan. Sa lahat po, kinakailangan po talaga kung ano ang naririyan ay tatanggapin natin (That’s just for health care workers. So, the rest must accept whatever vaccine is available),” Roque said. Nonetheless, Roque said no one would be forced to take CoronaVac. The FDA had allowed the emergency use of CoronaVac on healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 not including health care workers. On Wednesday, Roque said the government decided to administer the Sinovac vaccine to “economic frontliners” from 18 to 59 years old. He said Cabinet officials and even Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo might also be among the first in line to receive the vaccines from Sinovac. Roque said the government was “excited” over the delivery of the vaccines with President Rodrigo Duterte himself personally attending the ceremony prepared at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City on Sunday afternoon. AstraZeneca, too A day after the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines, the first round of the allocated doses from AstraZeneca from the Covax Facility will be arriving at noontime on Monday, Roque announced late Saturday in a statement. “This forms part of the 44 million doses of Covax to inoculate 20 percent of our population,” he said. Roque thanked the co-leaders of the Covax Facility — World Health Organization, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund — toward this end. The Philippines stands to get 9.4 million doses from AstraZeneca and US drugmaker Pfizer-BioNTech through the Covax Facility, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had said. The FDA has previously granted EUAs to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.

Benjamin Diokno, BDO Capital & Investment Corporation President Eduardo Francisco, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd and former finance secretary and Asia Pacific Credit Suisse Managing Director Jose Isidro Camacho speak during The Manila Times’ economic forum, Rising from the ashes: From Pan-Asian to pan-global, on Feb. 26, 2021. SCREENGRABBED FROM THE EVENT At The Manila Times economic forum on Friday, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd sees a GDP growth of between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent this year, the same forecast that was announced earlier. Central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno said inflation would be “benign” despite moves to ramp up consumer spending and the cost-push price increases seen recently. Former Finance secretary Jose Isidro Camacho, now the Credit Suisse Asia-Pacific managing director and vice president in Singapore, pointed out that the Philippines stood to benefit from its inclusion in Asean or Association of Southeast Asian Nations. That regional bloc, he added, was expected to grow 6 percent this year. And finally, Eduardo Francisco, BDO Capital and Investment Corp. president, said Philippine firms were generally healthy enough to weather the pandemic’s effects. Assumptions and caveats For the most part, we agree with the rosy outlook. But as in any forecast, certain assumptions were made. There were also a few caveats mentioned by the forum’s speakers, particularly related to the Covid-19 vaccines and the quality of recovery expected, that policymakers and other national leaders should not ignore. First, Secretary Dominguez mentioned that Congress needed to pass as many as 14 pieces of legislation certified as “priority” because of their role in economic recovery. Among the priority bills is Guide — Government Financial Institutions Unified Initiatives to Distressed Enterprises for Economic Recovery. Urgent amendments were also needed in the Foreign Investment Act, Public Service Act and Retail Trade Liberalization Act. These, the secretary added, would complement the country’s participation in the RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the largest multilateral trade agreement in the world. Whether Congress will buckle down to work on these proposals amid the distractions from the upcoming elections is yet to be seen. We should be vigilant against and intolerant of delays. Speaking of RCEP, Mr. Camacho was bullish about that multilateral agreement but explained that the dividends from it would not be seen soon. Meanwhile, the government has to do better in acquiring Covid-19 vaccines. We agree. As we pointed out many times in this space, the Philippine economy is consumption-led. Personal spending accounts for about 70 percent of GDP. And so, an economic recovery effort has to be anchored on easing the quarantine measures and bolstering consumer confidence by ensuring public health safety. The way to do that is to inoculate enough Filipinos to establish herd immunity. Regrettably, vaccines are proving to be difficult to acquire, a situation resulting from the perilous combination of global supply issues and poor administration of this health crisis. Worse, the slow vaccine rollout, which hopefully starts today, exacerbated the wealth gap, as well as the divide between the politically connected and others without similar connections. That matters and not only because viruses do not discriminate according to income brackets and political camps. Of course, there is labor. Most workers will not qualify to be among those on the priority list of people to be inoculated. If workers remain unprotected from the virus, restarting industries will be a struggle. There are also small enterprises, which are more vulnerable to the economic fallout. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) account for more than 96 percent of all registered firms in the country. MSMEs also employ 62.4 percent of the labor force, and they contribute 35.7 percent of the value added and 25 percent of export revenues.
To be fair, the Duterte government’s mantra is to “heal as one.” That sounds reassuring, but not everyone appears to be on the same page, so to speak. Instead, many seem more Darwinian — that is, survival of the fittest in terms of wealth and privilege. National leaders need to address these inequities, if the rosy economic forecasts mentioned earlier are to be realized.",Manila Times

Roque said the initial delivery forms “part of the 44 million doses of Covax to inoculate 20 percent” of the population. Roque thanked the World Health Organization, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund toward this end. “We are grateful to everyone — from our medical frontliners to our fellow Filipinos and foreign partners — who stand by us in this challenging time,” he said. “Together, we will heal and recover as one nation and one people,” the Palace official added. The Philippines stands to get 9.4 million doses from AstraZeneca and US drugmaker Pfizer-BioNTech through Covax facility, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had said. About 5.5 million of the 9.2 million doses are expected from AstraZeneca, whose initial delivery was scheduled mid to late February. On the other hand, 117,000 doses will come from Pfizer-BioNTech. The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously granted emergency use authorizations (EUAs)to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Philippine government is also set to receive the first batch of the Sinovac vaccines from China at 5 p.m. at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City today, February 28.

Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said Duterte on Friday retained the GCQ classification of the National Capital Region, Baguio City and Davao City until March 31. Also under GCQ are, for Luzon, Batangas and some areas in the Cordillera Administrative Region which include Apayao, Kalinga and Mountain Province; Tacloban City for the Visayas; Iligan City and Lanao del Sur for Mindanao, he said. The rest of the country, meanwhile, will be under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). “The above mentioned risk-level classifications will take effect starting Monday, March 1 until March 31, 2021,” Roque added. The new community quarantine classifications came days after Duterte rejected the proposal to place the country under MGCQ until the country’s Covid-19 vaccination program has started. Nine of 17 mayors in the capital region had backed a shift to MGCQ by March, which marks a year since the country was first placed under quarantine. Metro Manila, which accounts for about a third of the country’s gross domestic product, has been under GCQ since August 2020, with stricter lockdowns enforced in the earlier months as Covid-19 infections rose. To date, the country recorded 568,680 Covid-19 cases, with 524,042 recoveries and 12,201 deaths. The country has yet to receive any Covid-19 shot, with which it hoped to launch its vaccination drive this month, and cover up to 70 million people or two-thirds of the population through the year. The Palace has announced that the first batch of China’s Sinovac Biotech vaccines would arrive in the Philippines on Sunday. The President will personally witness the arrival of the vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently cleared the Sinovac vaccine for emergency use. However, Sinovac is not recommended for healthcare workers and senior citizens due to its 50 percent efficacy rate.

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT PHOTO JUST like other governments in the world grappling with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, the Duterte administration’s fight against the deadly virus got off to a rough start but started showing improvements after recalibrating its strategy by balancing the effective control of the disease, as well as the socioeconomic costs. Malacañang has released at least 33 coronavirus-related issuances, including Proclamation 922, which President Rodrigo Duterte signed on March 8 to declare a State of Public Health Emergency to mobilize government and non-government agencies to respond to the impending health crisis. “The declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency would capacitate government agencies and (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community,” the proclamation read. On Mar. 16, Duterte placed the entire Luzon under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) until Apr. 12. On the same day, he signed Proclamation 929 declaring a state of calamity throughout the country after health authorities confirmed that community-based transmission of Covid-19 has already occurred. “Such declaration will, among others, afford the national government, as well as LGUs ample latitude to utilize appropriate funds, including the Quick Response Fund, in their disaster preparedness and response efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 and to continue to provide basic services to the affected population,” it read. Bayanihan laws
To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, Duterte signed Republic Act (RA) 11469, also known as the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act of 2020 (Bayanihan 1), a day after Congress passed the bill on Mar. 24. Under the law, Duterte, for a limited time, was given special powers, including reallocation of government funds to address the prevailing health crisis. With the law in effect, the government was given the authority to expedite and streamline the accreditation of testing kits to facilitate prompt testing and immediate isolation and treatment of patients. Health care workers, considered as among the frontliners in the fight against Covid-19, had to be provided with Covid-19 special risk allowances in addition to their hazard pay. Their Covid-19-related medical expenses were also shouldered by the government. The government was also given the authority to provide compensation of P100,000 to health care workers who contracted severe Covid-19 infection while in the line of duty while P1 million may be provided to health care workers who die while fighting the pandemic. Banks and other financial institutions were ordered to implement grace periods for the payment of loans without incurring interests, penalties, fees, or other charges. In September, he signed RA 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2), which extended Duterte’s special powers for handling the pandemic and provide a P165.5-billion fund to address the health crisis. The largest chunk of the budget was allotted to loans for sectors hit by the pandemic, such as micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises, transport, tourism, and agriculture. It also provided for the government’s Covid-19 health-related response. Cash aid
Among the most salient features of the Bayanihan 1 law was the allocation of P200 billion worth of emergency subsidies to fund the government’s Social Amelioration Program (SAP), which granted a P5,000 to P8,000 monthly cash aid to about 18 million low-income Filipino families affected by the pandemic. The cash aid program was said to be the “largest financial aid package ever granted to Filipino households.” However, the SAP encountered delays in the release and distribution of funds. Despite hiccups, 71 percent of Filipino families said they received cash aid from the government since the start of the pandemic, according to SWS survey conducted from Sep. 17 to 20. Besides the SAP, the government also had other cash aid programs for the most vulnerable sectors affected by the lockdown, such as the Abot Kamay ang Pagtulong (AKAP), Tulong Panghanap-buhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD), and the Covid-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP). Duterte threatened to detain politicians who would engage in corruption amid the prevailing health crisis, saying that the public should never be deceived, especially in these trying times. On Nov. 10, he offered a cash prize worth P50,000 to P100,000 to anyone who could report dishonest government officials and their corruption activities. Test, Trace, Treat
In April, the government started its mass testing initiatives following the accreditation of several hospitals for Covid-19 testing. The government had also started purchasing more rapid antibody test kits, aiming to test 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the country’s 110 million population to get a clear picture of Covid-19 infections in the Philippines. On May 6, Duterte inked Executive Order (EO) 114 institutionalizing the “Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-Asa” program designed to help low-income families in Metro Manila resettle in their home provinces by assisting their transition with support and incentives on transportation, subsistence, and education, among others. “Balik Probinsya” was temporarily suspended to prioritize the short-term “Hatid Probinsya” or the provision of transportation assistance to locally stranded individuals and overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) stranded in Manila due to travel restrictions imposed under community quarantine. To ensure the health and safety of students, the President on July 17 signed RA 11480, which reschedules the start of the school year in case of a state of emergency or state of calamity. The opening of classes for School Year 2020-2021 kicked off on Oct. 5. He also stood by his decision not to allow face-to-face (F2F) classes until a vaccine for Covid-19 is available in the country. Although he initially approved pilot F2F classes in areas with low risk of Covid-19 on Dec. 14, he withdrew this plan a week after a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, emerged in the UK. In his fifth and penultimate State of the Nation Address on July 27, Duterte admitted that there were “lessons to be learned” from the Covid-19 pandemic. “The gains we achieved in the first three-and-a-half years were put to a test when the pandemic suddenly struck the global community. While I am aware that the road toward a comfortable life for all would be far easy if pandemic had not occurred and along the rest of the world we suffered,” he said. However, Duterte said the country was able to withstand the challenges brought about by the health crisis. He also vowed to facilitate the country’s economic recovery. “The global scale and socio-economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been unprecedented. Yet in the throes of this global health emergency, we have been able to withstand the headwinds generated by this coronavirus,” Duterte added. In August, the One Hospital Command system was launched to improve the referral system and interoperability of public and private health care facilities treating patients with Covid-19. In the same month, Duterte said he would volunteer to be among the first to be inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Russia, Sputnik V, to show “great trust.” Malacañang, however, said the President would first have to receive approval from the Presidential Security Group (PSG) before he is permitted to push through. Also in August, he formed a task force headed by the Department of Justice to investigate alleged corruption in the state-run Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) amid the pandemic. He also ordered the implementation of a reshuffle within the state insurance firm following the appointment of new PhilHealth chief Dante Gierran. Equal access to vaccines
On Sep. 23, Duterte, for the first time, participated in the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, where he stressed the importance of ensuring universal access to anti-Covid-19 technologies and products, including a safe and effective vaccine. “When the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor withheld. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy. The Philippines joins our partners in the Asean and the Non-Aligned Movement in raising our collective voice: the Covid-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good. Let us be clear on this,” he said. Duterte reiterated his call for equal access to vaccines in his speech during the 37th Asean Summit on Nov. 12, adding that the immediate priority right now should be “health security.” “We must work together to ensure that all nations – rich or poor – will have access to safe vaccines. No one is safe until all of us are safe,” he said. On Oct. 27, Duterte said he favored a government-to-government transaction in the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines, saying it would prevent the risk of corruption. In November, Duterte signed EO 118 placing a price cap on reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and test kits for Covid-19. In signing the EO, the President recognized the priority of the state to ensure that the general public, especially those from low- and middle-income households, have “equitable access” to quality and affordable health care services, such as Covid-19 tests. Although initially against the payment of reservation fees, Duterte on Nov. 19 approved the recommendation to make advance payments to suppliers of potential Covid-19 vaccines. He agreed to enter into advance market commitments (AMCs) to avoid being among the last countries to acquire a vaccine. He approved the recommendation a day after he noted that the government must get the “best bargain” for the country’s supply of Covid-19 vaccines once available. On Dec. 1, Duterte, through EO 121, granted authority to the Food and Drug Administration to issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Covid-19 drugs and vaccines subject to several conditions. The EUA is expected to speed up the processing time for approval of potential vaccines from six months to 21 to 28 days. Every Monday night, Duterte presides over a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) core members before his talk to the people to give the public updates on the government’s fight against the pandemic. In several speeches, he assured the public that the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines for Filipinos would be free from corruption. The poorest of the poor, the elderly, uniformed personnel, health care workers, and those with comorbidities will be prioritized in the government’s immunization drive. As Covid-19 vaccines remain unavailable, Duterte has repeatedly reminded the public to strictly observe health and safety protocols, particularly the wearing of face masks and face shields, washing of hands, and physical distancing. He cut short his Christmas vacation to meet with government officials on the new strain of SARS-COV-2 found in the UK on Dec. 26. During the meeting, he suggested the creation of a new task force that would focus on the new strain. Duterte later approved a recommendation to temporarily ban “all foreign travelers” from the UK and 19 other countries from entering the Philippines until Jan. 15, 2021. On Dec. 28, he signed the P4.5 trillion national budget for 2021 that includes funds allotted to boost government efforts to respond to the pandemic and provide critical measures to aid the economic and social sectors.",Manila Times

The long-anticipated shot could offer the nation a third vaccine option and help speed vaccinations by requiring just one dose instead of two. Food and Drug Administration scientists confirmed that overall the vaccine is about 66 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, and about 85 percent effective against the most serious illness. The agency also said J&J’s shot is safe. The analysis is just one step in the FDA’s evaluation. On Friday, the agency’s independent advisers will debate if the evidence is strong enough to recommend the shot. With that advice, the FDA is expected to make a final decision within days. The Covid-19 death toll in the US topped 500,000 this week, and the vaccination drive has been slower than hoped, hampered by logistical and weather delays. So far, about 44.5 million Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine made by Pfizer or Moderna, and nearly 20 million of them have received the second dose required for full protection. Tests showed the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were 95 percent effective at protection against symptomatic Covid-19. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, is part of the FDA advisory panel that will scrutinize the J&J data on Friday and cautions that none of the vaccines have been directly compared. Still, he was encouraged that one dose of the J&J vaccine appears as good at preventing serious illness as its two-dose competitors. “This is a vaccine to prevent you from going to the hospital and dying at a level that’s certainly comparable” to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, he said. J&J tested its single-dose option in 44,000 adults in the US, Latin America and South Africa. Different mutated versions of the virus are circulating in different countries, and the FDA analysis cautioned that it’s not clear how well the vaccine works against each variant. But J&J previously announced that the vaccine worked better in the US — 72 percent effective against moderate to severe Covid-19, compared with 66 percent in Latin America and 57 percent in South Africa. South Africa recently began giving the J&J vaccine to front-line health workers on a test basis after deciding that a vaccine from rival AstraZeneca had not shown strong enough study results against the particularly concerning variant spreading there. “I was reassured” that despite different variants, the J&J shot still protected against serious illness, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. “That’s pretty robust data.” In case the vaccines eventually need to be updated, manufacturers are working on adjustments to their recipes. Moderna announced Wednesday that it is ready to begin testing experimental doses that better match the South African version of the virus. Across all countries, the analysis of the J&J vaccine showed protection began to emerge about 14 days after vaccination. But by 28 days after vaccination, there were no hospitalizations or deaths in the vaccinated group compared with 16 hospitalizations and seven deaths in study recipients who received a dummy shot. This Dec. 2, 2020 photo provided by Johnson & Johnson shows vials of the Janssen Covid19 vaccine in the United States. Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine protects against COVID-19, according to an analysis by US regulators Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021, that sets the stage for a final decision on a new and easier-to-use shot to help tame the pandemic. PHOTO BY JOHNSON & JOHNSON VIA AP The FDA said effectiveness and safety were consistent across racial groups, including Black and Latino participants. All of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines have been tested differently, making comparisons nearly impossible. It would not be surprising if one dose turned out to be a little weaker than two doses, and policymakers will decide if that’s an acceptable trade-off to get more people vaccinated faster. J&J has another large study underway to see if a second dose of its vaccine works better, raising the prospect that countries could eventually add a booster if one turned out to be warranted. Like other Covid-19 vaccines, the main side effects of the J&J shot are pain at the injection site and flu-like fever, fatigue and headache. No study participant experienced the severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, that is a rare risk of some other Covid-19 shots, although one experienced a less serious reaction. The FDA said there were no serious side effects linked to the vaccine so far, although it recommended further monitoring for blood clots. In the study, those were reported in about 15 vaccine recipients and 10 placebo recipients, not enough of a difference to tell if the vaccine played any role. J&J was on track to become the world’s first one-dose option until earlier this month. Mexico announced it would use a one-dose version from China’s CanSino, which is made with similar technology as J&J’s shot but initially was developed as a two-dose option until beginning a one-dose test in the fall. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines now being used in the US and numerous other countries must be kept frozen, while the J&J shot can last three months in a refrigerator, making it easier to handle. AstraZeneca’s vaccine — widely used in Europe and Britain — is made similarly and also requires refrigeration but takes two doses. If the FDA clears the J&J shot for US use, it will not boost vaccine supplies significantly right away. Only a few million doses are expected to be ready for shipping in the first week. But J&J told Congress this week that it expected to provide 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million by summer. European regulators and the World Health Organization also are considering J&J’s vaccine. Worldwide, the company aims to produce around a billion doses by the end of the year. ",Manila Times

Humankind has been the subject of much research. Studies on human dynamics have caused many hours of thoughtful observations and reflections to draw out what these differences are among us humans. These differences underpin our manner of thinking, feeling and acting. These differences, salient and latent, lie beneath, much like what is below an iceberg, Understanding human dynamics. Our understanding of life, our dealing with relationships, how we perform our responsibilities, face problems, make decisions and choose and implement solutions — all these are influenced by an innate system in each of us. This system impacts on how we think, feel and act. Thus, there are these differences among identical twins, family members, teachers, students and among people within our respective organizations or communities with whom we work. Unless we are aware of our respective differences, we cannot avoid misunderstandings and thus fail in our relationships. For us teachers, we would likely have some unproductive teaching due to our approaches not matching our students’ learning processes. This situation results in minimized learning of our students or worse, in their dropping out from our classes or from the school. The same is true to child rearing or parenting. This explains why children at times become rebellious or would feel unloved, harboring ill feelings up to adult age because we parents fail to understand what anchors their manner of thinking, feeling and acting. Leaders who know the mental framework of their constituents, would be able “to utilize their own and that of their constituents’ distinctive processes and capacities to achieve optimal individual and group performance.” Otherwise, employees become unproductive. Employees would execute work haphazardly because of their leader whose manner of speech and action leaves much to strain relationships. What is human dynamics? Human dynamics is a doctoral subject for students with a major in human resource management or in leadership and organization. Human Dynamics is apt and necessary, especially for leaders and office heads, to understand the human systems that constitute their respective organizations. Understanding human dynamics would have leaders know what continuing professional development is appropriate for employees to recognize, appreciate, and optimally utilize their diverse capacities, and work together harmoniously and productively. Human dynamics would enlighten students by what scholars have drawn from their studies — the inner differences that influence how “people think, plan and learn; experience emotions; communicate and relate with others; and go about engaging in activities and projects.” (www.humandynamics.com › who-we-are) These latent differences are true to “everyone, regardless of age, gender, culture, country or race.” Human dynamics research. Studies refer to three human system principles: the mental, emotional and physical principles. These principles work in tandem as people relate to one another. These are distinctive pathways to living our lives which flourish and contribute best under certain conditions and which could be developed, given we are aware of them. “The mental principle…is related to the mind — to thinking, values, structure, focus, objectivity, and perspective. The more subjective emotional principle concerns relationships — such as communication, connection, organization, empathy, harmony and “putting things together in new ways (creativity).” (https://thesystems.com/human-dynamics-for-the-21st-century/) A person with a well-developed emotional principle “is aware of his or her own feelings without being dominated by them and expresses those feelings appropriately.” The creative imagination, which accesses the inner life and makes connections in new ways, is also an expression of the emotional principle, which results in creativity. The “physical principle covers the process of “doing, making, producing, concretizing, detailing, making operational, utilizing, ensuring practicality, cooperating, synthesizing and systematizing,” operations.

Studies show that individuals function well when mental, emotional and physical principles are “developed and integrated.” But “when one or more principles are underdeveloped, a lack of wholeness and relative ineffectiveness exists in certain areas of a person’s life.” (https://dritter55.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/a-brief-review-of-human-dynamics/) “Whereas the mental principle is associated with the mind and thinking, and the emotional principle, with feelings and relating, the physical principle is aligned with the body and the translation into action of what is thought and felt.” (https://dritter55.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/a-brief-review-of-human-dynamics/) Drawing from these principles, how do they impact on the adaptiveness and preparedness of societies to the hazards of the pandemic? “The understanding of the dynamics which unfold during and in the direct aftermath of a pandemic are key to effective and efficient management decisions.” (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11299-020-00256-y) Human dynamics: impact on Covid-19 interventions. An analysis how the interventions adopted by different countries were influenced by the human dynamics of their respective governments — the people involved in coming out with these choices — would render us lessons. As Simon, et al. (1990; Gaissmaier & Gigerenzer, 2012) wrote, human dynamics that anchored their long term perspectives are likely to be shaped by two factors — the individual mind and the structure of the environment. “The former is affected by the perception of the Covid-19 pandemic as a dread risk with changes in behavioral patterns lurking” (Gigerenzer, 2004).“The latter also affects individual behavior as it determines the boundaries for adaptivity.” (Simon, 1990). “The structure of the environment is, amongst others, shaped by policy decisions.” Given the environment and the mindsets of our decision makers, we hope interventions adopted to ease our lives in this pandemic could have “a long-term perspective.” This “might help minimize unwanted (and often delayed) effects.” Error!

After graduating from a university high school in the country’s typhoon belt, I wanted to pursue college education in the university belt in Manila. But I first needed a job to finance my college education. Before I enrolled in college, I literally walked along Taft, Escolta, Dasmariñas, Tetuan, Avenida Rizal and Azcarraga to find a decent albeit menial job. There was no internet, Google or company websites then to make job hunting easy. Every day, I would meet ever changing faces coming my way, as I looked at street signs to my right and left. I would read familiar messages — NO Vacancy, Mail, Wanted Houseboy: Apply Inside, Beware of Dog (or its variation which warns “Forget the Dog, Beware the Owner”), Post No Bill, Do Not Enter, Under Renovation, or Under New Management. I knew what the other signs meant, but I was curious what “new management” would look like. I would often wonder, “Is the new management grumpier and greedier or kinder and more generous than the old one?” Game changer
My first encounter with a Manager reminded me how small I was in the overall scheme of things, especially in the context of my position as messenger (with a lower case “m”). I didn’t know if that was how Managers at that time were taught to behave, but I noticed that most managers would almost always maintain a certain distance between them and their subordinates. Many were autocratic, spoke in measured manner and tone, and could not care less how demeaning they would often treat other people. Fortunately, in 1960, Douglas McGregor wrote a book that helped me change my outlook about management. He was a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1950s and 1960s, and his book was called, “The Human Side of Enterprise.” McGregor proposed that there are two alternative ways by which managers perceive and address employee motivation. According to McGregor, Theory X management assumes that people dislike work and will avoid it if they could; that people are not ambitious and would rather be directed; and that people are gullible, resist change, and should be coerced and controlled if you expect them to help achieve organizational goals. Conversely, Theory Y management assumes that people consider work as natural as play and rest, are responsible and, given the right conditions, will seek responsibility. People can be committed to achieve quality and productivity goals if the right rewards are in place. It was McGregor who first pointed out that a “command-and-control” environment is not effective. In early corporate America, “command-and-control” was the norm — thanks to retired Generals who were rewarded with corporate positions after World War 2. McGregor thought that the essence of “command-and-control” relies on lower needs for motivation, which are mostly satisfied already among the majority of employees. This theory was a corollary to Abraham Maslow’s “Hierarchy of Needs Theory.” When employees lose their motivation, they will tend to dislike their work, avoid responsibility, resist change, etc. That creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Change drivers
Among enlightened managers, McGregor’s simple concept was a game changer. Over the years, when the “profession” of management developed to its fullness in the 1980s and 1990s, a bunch of enlightened Theory Y managers created a critical mass that swayed the practice of management towards how we experience it today. Also, there are significant change drivers that forced the practice of management to change. First is technology. The management practice championed by Frederick Winslow Taylor during the First Industrial Revolution was based on the technology in the days of Henry Ford, who leveraged the production line for utmost efficiency. Today and in the future, the Internet of Things will have a tremendous impact on the way managers will relate with their subordinates. In fact, even the face of management is now changing. In some cases, and where robotics and artificial intelligence have fully set into workplace processes, subordinates are already taking orders from C-3PO (the speaking, walking humanoid robot in “Star Wars”). Lest human managers and supervisors become irrelevant, they must be tech savvy now and in the future. To stay relevant, managers must have empathy and compassion — something that robot supervisors still don’t have. Second is information. As information almost doubles every year, it has become a most important global resource. Managers must have information at their fingertips in order to manage effectively. Enough said! The third is the changing demographics. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of the workplace are between their 20s and 30s. The elderly managers must adjust their management style to make these workplace inhabitants tick. Enough said, too! Managing in the next normal
Management and leadership will continue to change, as the business of doing business changes. In the next normal, managers must be able to adapt to the changing environment or C-3PO will take their jobs. Here are some of the requisites for managing in the next normal: – Caring. The Covid-19 pandemic provided lessons that managers did not learn in Management 101. Henceforth, managers are expected to be deeply concerned about employees’ safety, health and overall well-being. People expect to work in a safe environment that offers them not just ample pay and benefits, but a sense of belonging, social contact and a semblance of normalcy. – Character and integrity. Employees prefer to work with managers who share the same values with them. Managers must live and demonstrate in no uncertain terms the Company’s mission and values, in a way that people can feel and empathize with. While being transparent with organizational and environmental realities, managers must exude optimism and hope, inspire, and motivate their people. – Competence. Skills are the new currency of the future. Emerging managerial roles require an elaborate mix of hard and soft skills. While intelligence quotient (IQ) remains constant, emotional quotient (EQ) can be developed and improved over time. EQ and adversity quotient (AQ) are among the soft skills that will help managers succeed when the going gets tougher. Managers must indulge in intentional lifelong learning in order to stay sharp, smart, and relevant. – Crisis-proofing. Businesses, brands and people that survive during crises are generally purpose-driven. Revisit your purpose; find a niche that is aligned with your purpose. Managers must develop resilient strategies for business continuity and sustainability. In like manner, they should develop even more creative strategies for career continuity and sustainability. Amid the growing uncertainty, managers must learn to adapt to the neck-breaking speed at which changes in the global environment occur. In a recent online management and leadership forum, I told managers to “[c]hallenge your current assumptions about management and leadership in the next normal. When the smoke clears, we could be seeing a different landscape in the workplace that will require a different set of managerial and leadership skills. Upskill and reskill to be relevant.” Obviously, there are new and emerging dimensions in management that were different from what Taylor, Ford, McGregor and Maslow saw during their time. This is the time for “new management” in uncertain times. Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, said, “There are four ingredients in true leadership: brains, soul, heart and good nerves.” The whole world is still in deep trouble. Perhaps, it should be “Under New Management.” Ernie Cecilia is the chairman of the Human Capital Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (AMCHAM); Co-Chairman of the Employers Confederation of the Philippines’ (ECOP’s) TWG on Labor Policy and Social Issues; and past president of the People Management Association of the Philippines (PMAP).

The patient, Gabriella Forgione, wasn’t complaining. The 25-year-old pharmacy worker was happy to be prodded and poked at the hospital in Nice, in southern France, to advance her increasingly pressing quest to recover her sense of smell. Along with her sense of taste, it suddenly vanished when she fell ill with Covid-19 in November, and neither has returned. Being deprived of the pleasures of food and the scents of things that she loves are proving tough on her body and mind. Shorn of odors both good and bad, Forgione is losing weight and self-confidence. “Sometimes I ask myself, ‘Do I stink?'” she confessed. “Normally, I wear perfume and like for things to smell nice. Not being able to smell bothers me greatly.” A year into the coronavirus pandemic, doctors and researchers are still striving to better understand and treat the accompanying epidemic of Covid-19-related anosmia — loss of smell — draining much of the joy of life from an increasing number of sensorially frustrated longer-term sufferers like Forgione. Gabriella Forgione, a 25-year-old patient, holds still as a doctor slides a miniature camera up her nose during tests in a hospital in Nice, France on Monday, Feb. 8, 2021, to help determine why she has been unable to smell or taste since she contracted Covid-19 in November 2020. AP PHOTO Even specialist doctors say there is much about the condition they still don’t know and they are learning as they go along in their diagnoses and treatments. Impairment and alteration of smell have become so common with Covid-19 that some researchers suggest that simple odor tests could be used to track coronavirus infections in countries with few laboratories. For most people, the olfactory problems are temporary, often improving on their own in weeks. But a small minority are complaining of persistent dysfunction long after other Covid-19 symptoms have disappeared. Some have reported continued total or partial loss of smell six months after infection. The longest, some doctors say, are now approaching a full year. Researchers working on the vexing disability say they are optimistic that most will eventually recover but fear some will not. Some doctors are concerned that growing numbers of smell-deprived patients, many of them young, could be more prone to depression and other difficulties and weigh on strained health systems. “They are losing color in their lives,” said Dr. Thomas Hummel, who heads the smell and taste outpatients clinic at University Hospital in Dresden, Germany. “These people will survive and they’ll be successful in their lives, in their professions,” Hummel added. “But their lives will be much poorer.” At the Face and Neck University Institute in Nice, Dr. Clair Vandersteen wafted tube after tube of odors under Forgione’s nose after he had rooted around in her nostrils with his camera. “Do you perceive any smell? Nothing? Zero? OK,” he asked, as she repeatedly and apologetically responded with negatives. Only the last tube provoked an unequivocal reaction. “Urgh! Oh, that stinks,” Forgione yelped. “Fish!” Test complete, Vandersteen delivered his diagnosis. “You need an enormous amount of an odor to be able to smell something,” he told her. “You haven’t completely lost your sense of smell but nor is it good.” The hand of Dr. Clair Vandersteen wafts a tube of odors under the nose of a blindfolded patient, Gabriella Forgione, during tests in a hospital in Nice, southern France, Monday, Feb. 8, 2021. AP PHOTO He sent her away with homework: six months of olfactory rehab. Twice daily, choose two or three scented things, like a sprig of lavender or jars of fragrances, and smell them for two to three minutes, he ordered. “If you smell something, great. If not, no problem. Try again, concentrating hard on picturing the lavender, a beautiful purple bloom,” he said. “You have to persevere.” Losing the sense of smell can be more than a mere inconvenience. Smoke from a spreading fire, a gas leak, or the stink of rotten food can all pass dangerously unnoticed. Fumes from a used diaper, dog’s dirt on a shoe or sweaty armpits can be embarrassingly ignored. And as poets have long known, scents and emotions are often like lovers entwined. Evan Cesa used to relish meal times. Now they’re a chore. A fish dinner in September that suddenly seemed flavorless first flagged to the 18-year-old sports student that COVID-19 had attacked his senses. Foodstuffs became mere textures, with only residual hints of sweet and saltiness. Five months later, breakfasting on chocolate cookies before classes, Cesa still chewed without joy, as though swallowing cardboard. “Eating no longer has any purpose for me,” he said. “It is just a waste of time.” Cesa is among the anosmia sufferers being studied by researchers in Nice who, before the pandemic, had been using scents in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. They also used comforting fragrances to treat post-traumatic stress among children after a truck terror attack in Nice in 2016, when a driver plowed through holiday crowds, killing 86 people. Dr. Clair Vandersteen (right) wafts a tube of odors under the nose of a patient, Gabriella Forgione. AP PHOTO The researchers are now turning their expertise to Covid-19, teaming up with perfumers from the nearby fragrance-producing town of Grasse. Perfumer Aude Galouye worked on the fragrant waxes that were wafted under Cesa’s nose to measure his olfactory impairment, with scents at varying concentrations. “The sense of smell is a sense that is fundamentally forgotten,” Galouye said. “We don’t realize the effect it has on our lives except, obviously, when we no longer have it.” The examinations on Cesa and other patients also include language and attention tests. The Nice researchers are exploring whether olfactory complaints are linked to Covid-related cognitive difficulties, including problems with concentrating. Cesa stumbled by picking the word “ship” when “kayak” was the obvious choice on one test. “That is completely unexpected,” said Magali Payne, a speech therapist on the team. “This young man shouldn’t be experiencing linguistic problems.” “We have to keep digging,” she said. “We are finding things out as we see patients.” Cesa longs to have his senses restored, to celebrate the taste of pasta in carbonara sauce, his favorite dish, and a run through the fragrant wonders of the great outdoors. “One might think that it is not important to be able to smell nature, trees, forests,” he said. “But when you lose the sense of smell, you realize how truly lucky we are to be able to smell these things.”",Manila Times

Gonzales,2021-02-22,"Widen amusement tax coverage, LGUs told","A think tank suggested expanding the coverage of amusement taxes that local government units (LGUs) can impose to include streaming shows as they look for other means to increase their sources of revenues amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a report over the weekend, the National Tax Research Center (NTRC) said local governments need more of these sources to finance their various programs and continue serving their constituents as the Covid-19 crisis persisted. It suggested broadening the scope of the local amusement tax as a way to boost earnings, as “LGUs should not only rely on the fiscal support and allocations from the national government.” Revenue collections from amusement taxes may be insignificant compared to others, but these still contribute to state coffers, the think tank emphasized. Local and national amusement taxes collected reached P887.72 million and P134.50 million, respectively, from 2014 to 2018, according to the report. The cancellation of several entertainment events on account of the pandemic resulted in lower revenues in the Greater Manila Area, where almost half of these came from. The government banned them at the onset of the pandemic, as they encourage mass gatherings that would allow the coronavirus to spread. The estimated revenue loss from taxes collected from SM Prime Holdings Inc. — which operates the Sy Group’s shopping malls, as well as cinemas — alone amounted to P376.39 million at end-September 2020. “As it stands and as construed by the Supreme Court in various cases, Section 140 of the LGC (Local Government Code) of 1991, as amended, is limited only to theaters, cinemas, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement where one seeks admission to entertain oneself by seeing or viewing the show or performance,” the report said. “In this regard, the coverage of local amusement tax may be broadened to include places that may be considered as places of amusement. In addition, the phrase ‘places of amusement’ must be defined appropriately so as to include other establishments that may be considered as such,” it added. While the pandemic suspended or canceled most shows and programs, there are online streaming shows that can be regarded as sources of amusement, according to the NTRC, noting that people are watching them at home amid the state-imposed mobility restrictions. “The LGUs can tap these sites as sources of tax revenues as the country [adapts to] the new normal,” it said. “LGUs need a broader range of revenue tools. These should include revenue sources that automatically grow with the economy, and at present live streaming may be closely considered as an additional revenue source of LGUs,” the think tank added. “However, it is crucial that social and economic issues are taken into consideration so that new funding sources shift costs fairly on those who can most afford to pay.” The administrative aspect of imposing this tax should also be considered, according to the NTRC. “Congress should consider reviewing the LGC of 1991, as amended, to align the limitations and taxing powers of LGUs to modern business models. For instance, expanding the coverage of local amusement tax may be explored by policymakers to provide additional revenue to LGUs,” it said. “Expanding the local amusement tax coverage will give sufficient leeway for the local sanggunian (council) to explore other activities that may be covered by the local amusement tax,” it added.",Manila Times

Of course, it is always better to be prepared. As Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” But with delay after delay in the arrival, the dry runs are becoming less virtuous and more comedic. A Manila health worker shows how to aspire a Covid-19 vaccine from a mock vial, during a mass vaccination simulation activity for senior citizens inside the Legarda Elementary School in Sampaloc, Manila, on 18 February 2021. PHOTO BY MIKE ALQUINTO Indeed, the latest from the Palace is that even President Rodrigo Duterte has grown impatient with the delays. That should have been reassuring, until we remember that he heads the government that is on the receiving end of the blame. Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine from the Covax Facility were supposed to arrive by mid-February, but delivery was snagged because of vague issues surrounding the indemnity agreement. Also, the 600,000 doses of China’s Sinovac Biotech vaccine expected to arrive on February 23 may also be delayed because the manufacturer has yet to secure emergency use authorization from the local Food and Drug Administration. With frustration growing, the government now has to parry more criticisms than usual. Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo, along with other government critics like Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros, pointed out that even less developed countries like Bangladesh have started inoculations. The observation may be factual but perhaps out of context. Such statements only add to the absurd play and are helpful only in scoring cheap political points. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered a broader perspective on the matter. He said he was alarmed by the global disparity of vaccine distribution. He pointed out that 130 countries have yet to receive vaccines, and that only 10 nations have administered 75 percent of the doses available. Guterres also appealed to the Group of 20 or G20 to bear more of the responsibility for financing and implementing vaccination programs around the world, saying the UN will provide them its full support. “If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in the Global South, it will mutate again and again. New variants could become more transmissible, more deadly and, potentially, threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines and diagnostics,” he explained in a story by Agence France-Presse. “This can prolong the pandemic significantly, enabling the virus to come back to plague the Global North.” Those fears are proving to be prophetic. Just on Saturday, The Manila Times reported that two new Covid-19 variants were discovered in Central Visayas. Health experts are still studying these variants, but mutations found elsewhere in the world seem to be more transmissible and virulent, possibly even resistant to the vaccines now being distributed. Consequences of delays Besides more people falling ill or dying, the delays in vaccination will likely spawn black markets and encourage criminal activities. That may already be happening, and if this is true, the situation becomes more complicated for the Duterte government. A few months ago, when media uncovered that the President’s security detail received Covid-19 shots that were smuggled into the country, there were also reports that thousands of Chinese expatriates and Chinese Filipinos had been vaccinated somehow. As we mentioned before in this space, a local black market for vaccines may have already emerged. With people desperate for protection from the pandemic and with the country eager to restart the economy, more may become susceptible to all sorts of schemes. Getting authentic vaccines through unlawful means is one thing, but what if people are duped into paying for fake shots or being injected with placebos? Can buyers tell whether they are getting a flu shot instead of a tested Covid-19 vaccine? Sadly, this issue subsided when President Duterte himself objected to an investigation of the Presidential Security Group (PSG). For the sake of protecting the PSG, there was no directive to look into the vaccine black market. That is yet another act in this unfolding horseplay. The public is distracted by the illusion of movement from simulations, but there is hardly any action. The government needs to get its act together somehow, despite the global issues. More than anything else, that would help bring down the curtains on this tiresome tragedy.",Manila Times

According to Dr. Cynthia Saloma, University of the Philippines-Philippine Genome Center (UP-PGC) director, the E484K and the N501Y mutations were detected in 31 out the 70 samples that came from the region during the sequencing made by the center on February 11. “These are mutations of global concern that were exhibited by variants of concern tulad ng nasa (like in) South Africa, yung sa Brazil and yung sa United Kingdom,” Saloma said in a press conference on Friday. Saloma said the “silent” mutation of the SARS-CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus 2) virus was brought about by changes in the sequence of its deoxyribonucleic or ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA) pairs, and can either cause a loss, gain in function or possibly no change at all. The variants are considered viruses that developed from a specific group of mutations, causing them to behave differently from the strain they originated from. Both mutations can either increase the transmission of Covid-19 and reduce the efficacy of the current vaccines in use, according to Saloma. The cases with these mutations had only exhibited mild symptoms and were cleared. Saloma added that the PGC Genomic Biosurveillance team and the DoH epidemiology bureau will now closely check the genome sequences of the samples and monitor the cases that had been infected with these mutations. Despite the discovery of the new mutations in Central Visayas, Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd said that this may not affect Metro Manila’s planned shift to modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) by March 1 as long as the region is careful in enforcing a more relaxed status. “We have to scale up even more in the light of these variants… our massive promotion to let the public comply with all of our minimum public health standards, and the aggressive early detection by way of testing, tracing and isolation,” Duque said.",Manila Times
68,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/19/opinion/columnists/secure-and-insecure-citizenship/842604/,Stephen CuUnjieng,2021-02-19,Secure and insecure citizenship,"I WAS debating whether to write another article on Covid-19 having first read a very intelligent article in The Atlantic and given the misinformation being peddled by others. There are those who for their personal reasons have an ideological bias that overcomes fact and reason, but I decided against another article that would marginally be bringing up new points given all the major ones that have already been set forth. Maybe if it was substantially on points not previously raised or new verified information rather than rehashing whatever one’s bias dictates and quoting prejudiced sources. On the topic, I am not discussing what is the way we should apply our citizenship laws. While I did work at the Romulo Law Office and passed the bar, my legal career ended in 1984, and I do not pretend to be up to date or remember enough of what I was ably taught decades ago. This is about our attitude toward citizenship and contrast that with others. Many may take issue with my observations, but that is what reasoned discourse is about. I have observed that generally, the more secure a country is, the more liberal their citizenship laws. The less differences in citizenship rights between natural and naturalized, the more open-minded their attitude toward citizenship is. Same is true on how straightforward and open the country is to naturalization. An exception to this is Japan, where like the Philippines one only gets citizenship through jus sanguinis (bloodline — so a parent must be a citizen to bestow citizenship on a child) vs jus soli (where you are born). Places like the US and UK give both jus sanguinis and soli. In Japan you have people who legally work and stay there for generations but because of bloodline never become citizens. That would be the case here as well unless you opt for naturalization. Ironically, it often seems the stricter the citizenship laws, the less desirable the country often is for citizenship anyway. These tend to be the jus sanguinis only countries. Jus soli or jus sanguinis
Why do countries like the US (though the nativist and racist Trump talked about changing it and fortunately his losing ends that immediate fear) apply jus soli? Why do they grant citizenship if you were born there and have for immigrants a relatively straightforward path to citizenship? First, these tend to be countries that had high immigration in their formative years and encouraged it (though the US also has swung the other way under Trump and had its shameful racist periods like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Japanese incarceration in times of backlash and xenophobia). Second, they tend to be successful and secure countries that argue if you stay here it is because you want to and believe it, to use the popular phrase, to be “the land of opportunity.” Let us not digress into talk among elites who argue about their privileges and so on here vs there. I am talking about opportunity in spite of challenges overall. Those countries are generally not worried that you are going there to exploit the country. You are going there to be part of it. You have bought into their narrative or at least believe that for all the challenges, the opportunities there are better than back home. My one digression that really gets me angry is when people tout the Philippines as paradise because you can have maids and personal help en masse. Guess what? Maybe it is paradise for those who have maids. It is far from paradise for the ones rendering the service. To many and I agree, it is a sign of advancement and civilization that there are enough opportunities in a country that many do not have to be domestic help and if they do so, are compensated enough so it is at least partially a choice rather than something one does for lack of choice or to survive. A paradise is one that is paradise for all or most. Not some tiny sliver only. When my family and I lived in the US, we had no live-in or full-time help. If you needed or wanted someone to come in to clean the house or mow the lawn you contracted with a service, and they would come over, often as a team and do what they needed to in a few hours and then would come back depending on your schedule weekly or as one needed or scheduled. In New York City, it is often an individual rather than a team given most have apartments. Also, the society is structured so you do not need live-in or permanent help to have a comfortable life. The only exception is if you have very young children; then the need to arrange reliable baby-sitters is a chore and can be a challenge. Hence one often sees parents bringing their infants with them to restaurants, cinemas and the like. Related to this is the comment I often hear which is, why do Filipinos do well when abroad? I think it is in large part that our country, 75 years after independence, has not delivered for its ever-increasing population. In our region, Malaysia and Thailand have and Vietnam is clearly on its way to doing so. I remember being so proud after 1986 and so sad for China after 1989. Let us be blunt, absent surface political rights (and I say surface and superficial because who really benefits and can make use of our democratic rights), who is better off if we take conditions prevailing in 1990 as the starting point? On both an individual and country level — the Philippines or China? The answer except for political dissidents is so sadly and blatantly obvious. To go back to the question, why do Filipinos do well abroad while the country underperforms? I used to say, the biggest vote in the Philippines is not the vote for this or that candidate. It is the vote to leave, which tens of millions of Filipinos have taken and continue to take. In my view, Filipinos do well abroad for two reasons — simply because they are incentivized to do so and generally those who go abroad are the more aggressive and adventurous ones. Let us assume you are in a middle position, not happy but not unhappy. Which type of person chooses to stay and which chooses to try something different elsewhere? Who is willing to be away from their families, friends, comfort zone and environment? The latter might not be smarter or wiser and it may be the wrong decision, but that person is definitely more adventurous and open to new ideas and challenges. Guess what? That is what they say in other countries as well, where there is a diaspora until the home country becomes successful and many return home. Natural-born vs naturalized
An offshoot of this is the different rights of natural-born and naturalized citizens. In the US, I think the only differentiator I know is that only a natural-born citizen can be president and if there was fraud in the naturalization process, citizenship can be rescinded. A natural-born citizen cannot have this citizenship removed or revoked. The US requires certain industries like media and transportation and their CEOs to be American. They do not distinguish between natural and naturalized. When he bought the New York Post decades ago, Rupert Murdoch acquired American citizenship to enable himself to be a publisher. Same thing with elected and appointed government officials below president. There was even some fringe speculation during Watergate after VP Agnew resigned that Nixon appointed Kissinger who was a naturalized citizen as vice president as he could not run for and be elected president but if Nixon resigned, he could become president. Don’t know if that view was accurate and many who detest Kissinger would have been aghast if it had happened, but it did not come to pass. Yet some writers speculated on it. Dual citizens
This is another thing secure countries are relaxed about. Mark Carney was the governor of the Central Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013. Having done an exemplary job and being a dual citizen of Canada and the United Kingdom, he was then made governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. Economist Stanley Fischer, who was born in what is now Zambia (the former Northern Rhodesia) has dual citizenship — Israeli and American. He was chief economist of the World Bank, then from 2005 to 2013 was governor of the Bank of Israel. In 2014, President Obama appointed him vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He stepped down for personal reasons in 2017. Jennifer Granholm is both a Canadian and naturalized American citizen and was born in Canada. She was elected and served as governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011 and has now been appointed secretary of energy by President Biden. What is my point behind these examples? The US, the UK, Canada and Israel did not care if they were dual citizens or naturalized. They just wanted the best and most qualified citizens. Why exclude citizens based on having more than one citizenship or being naturalized? I would suggest in a country like ours, where so many left for opportunity and necessity, why discriminate against them if they want to engage in public service when they return? Recovery of citizenship was a good step but why be so insecure and stop there? The same for naturalized citizens. You must really want to be part of the country if you take an actual step of taking citizenship. If one argues but they left or they got naturalized for opportunistic reasons, my answer is so what? If they are lousy or disloyal, then remove them or vote them out. Are we that insecure? Or jealous?",Manila Times

The UN chief told a high-level meeting of the UN Security Council that 130 countries have not received a single dose of vaccine and declared that “at this critical moment, vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community.” Guterres called for an urgent Global Vaccination Plan to bring together those with the power to ensure fair vaccine distribution — scientists, vaccine producers and those who can fund the effort. The secretary-general called on the world’s major economic powers in the Group of 20 to establish an emergency task force to establish a plan and coordinate its implementation and financing. He said the task force should have the capacity “to mobilize the pharmaceutical companies and key industry and logistics actors.” Guterres said Friday’s meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations “can create the momentum to mobilize the necessary financial resources.” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, whose country holds the Security Council presidency this month, urged the UN’s most powerful body to adopt a resolution calling for ceasefires in conflict zones to allow the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines. Thirteen ministers were scheduled to address the meeting on improving access to Covid-19 including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Britain says more than 160 million people are at risk of being excluded from coronavirus vaccinations because they live in countries engulfed in conflict and instability, including Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia. “Global vaccination coverage is essential to beating coronavirus,” Raab said ahead of the meeting. “That is why the UK is calling for a vaccination cease-fire to allow Covid-19 vaccines to reach people living in conflict zones and for a greater global team effort to deliver equitable access.” Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward said: “Humanitarian organizations and UN agencies need the full backing of the council to be able to carry out the job we are asking them to do.” Woodward said cease-fires have been used to carry out vaccinations, pointing to a two-day pause in fighting in Afghanistan in 2001 that enabled 35,000 health workers and volunteers to vaccinate 5.7 million children under the age of 5 against polio. Britain has drafted a Security Council resolution that Woodward said the UK hopes will be adopted in the coming weeks. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Tuesday that Mexico will stress the importance of equal access for all countries to Covid-19 vaccines at the council meeting. He was sharply critical that countries that produce the vaccine have high vaccination rates while Latin American countries have problems obtaining any vaccines. The coronavirus has infected more than 109 million people and killed at least 2.4 million of them. But many countries have not yet started vaccination programs and even rich nations are facing shortages of vaccine doses as manufacturers struggle to ramp up production. The World Health Organization’s COVAX program, an ambitious project to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world’s poorest people, has already missed its own goal of beginning coronavirus vaccinations in poor countries at the same time that shots were rolled out in rich countries. Numerous developing countries have rushed in recent weeks to sign their own private deals to buy vaccines, unwilling to wait for COVAX. Woodward said Britain supports reserving 5% of COVAX doses as a “last resort” buffer to ensure that high-risk populations have access to Covid-19 vaccines.",Manila Times
70,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/18/campus-press/are-supervisors-still-relevant-in-the-next-normal/842225/,"Ernie Cecilia, DPM",2021-02-18,Are supervisors still relevant in the next normal?,"Almost a year ago, Josh Dzieza, investigations editor and feature writer at “The Verge,” wrote an article that could scare today’s Supervisors. The handwriting on the wall looks clear, “In warehouses, call centers and other sectors, intelligent machines are managing humans, and they’re making work more stressful, grueling, and dangerous.” Robo-bosses
Dzieza continues, “The robots are watching over hotel housekeepers, telling them which room to clean and tracking how quickly they do it. They’re managing software developers, monitoring their clicks and scrolls and docking their pay if they work too slowly. They’re listening to call center workers, telling them what to say, how to say it, and keeping them constantly, maximally busy. While we’ve been watching the horizon for the self-driving trucks, perpetually five years away, the robots arrived in the form of the supervisor, the foreman, the middle manager.” Robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) have arrived, and workers in many countries are worried. Dzieza said, “For many of them, their greatest fear isn’t that robots might come for their jobs: it’s that robots have already become their boss.” While many employees detest the thought of being supervised by a robot, a recent survey by Kevin Kruse, CEO of LEADx, revealed that more than 20 percent of workers would want to replace their boss with a generic robot. The LEADx survey results could be unsettling for some supervisors, considering that supervisors have come a long way since the medieval times and have been permanent fixtures in today’s workplace. Origin of supervisor
According to Wikipedia, the word “supervisor” came from the Medieval Latin verb “supervidēre,” meaning “to oversee.” The prefix super (also supra) means “over” or “above”, while the Latin vidēre means “to see.” Literally, to supervise means to see from above. The supervisor is also known by several names — foreman, boss, overseer, monitor, area coordinator or sometimes “gaffer.” In the factory, the supervisor is in a low-level management position. In the academe, the supervisor could be one of the most senior in the staff, such as a Professor who oversees a PhD dissertation. Sometimes, people in the same job grade as the Supervisor are also classified as supervisors, even if they do not supervise other people. Supervisors’ dilemma
Perhaps, supervisors are one of the most misunderstood and stressed people in the workplace. They have productivity-conscious bosses above them and sometimes uncooperative subordinates below them. They’re like the “bibingka,” the Filipino rice cake cooked with fire under it and burning coal on top of it. The first time I was promoted to be a supervisor came as a surprise. I had no training to be one. It seemed that my boss perceived how good I was at doing my clerical tasks. As a reward, I was promoted! Then my headaches began. Here’s why: Like I said, I never had any supervisory skills training before I got promoted. It felt like I was thrown into the pool, and I heard my boss shouting, “Swim!” I was good at technical work, but I never did management or supervisory work. The scope of my job was unclear at first. My friends and fellow employees suddenly became my subordinates. I was not sure if they were ready to accept me as their boss. My sense sometimes told me that some, not all, resented my promotion since many of them had more seniority and longevity in the company. Suddenly, I had two jobs — doing my own and minding the jobs of others. Somehow, I thought that I was programmed to be a rank and file. I had to reprogram my thinking and thought process to be like a manager. It was tough without support from my Manager. To those supervisors who now experience the same dilemma I encountered early in my career, here are some suggestions you might find useful: – Role clarification. First understand your new role — including what you’re supposed to do and what you’re not supposed to do. Ask your boss about his/her expectations and the limits of your authority. Once you’re clear on the parameters with your boss, clarify the same with your subordinates. Whenever possible, take time to discuss this with your subordinates as a group and on a one-on-one basis. Listen to their reactions — verbal and nonverbal — and to what is not being said. – Remain professional at all times. As a new “boss,” you need to establish professional working relationships with your bosses, peers and subordinates. Focus on issues and the tasks at hand, rather than on personalities. Do not shoot the messenger who brings you unsavory news. Be seen as a leader and enabler of others – not bossy, not pushing too hard. – Refrain from office politics. At all cost, avoid corridor or water-cooler politics. Do not side with one party to a dispute that you must arbitrate. Remain neutral, objective and fair always. Don’t get tempted to listen to juicy gossip, lest one day you’re subject of it, too. – Raise your managerial skills. Always sharpen your saw, as Covey said. While the management principles hardly change, the practice is influenced by a number of change drivers in business and in life. Continue to be a student of the art and science of management. Learn the science and adapt it to your working environment. C-3PO as boss?
First-time supervisors must not be wary about lack of supervisory, managerial or leadership skills. They are easily learned from the right sources. What is more worrisome is the development in technology that enables the machines to take over the supervisors’ jobs. The other aspect to worry about is the reaction of workers to the idea of changing a human supervisor with a robot. The younger employees are more willing and ready to trade their current boss with C-3PO. Many employees join a company. But Gallup says employees resign from their bosses. The Gallup survey speaks volumes. Bad bosses are perhaps the major reason for low employee engagement. The LEADx survey says that roughly 30 percent of employees would replace their boss with a friendly humanoid robot-like C-3PO. Recent employee engagement surveys confirm that 30 percent of employees worldwide are disengaged. Coincidence? The LEADx survey revealed the main reasons why employees would replace their bosses with robots: a) they don’t like their boss; 2) their boss is biased; 3) their boss lacks competence; and 4) their boss lacks people skills and empathy. The onus is on supervisors to prove that they are still relevant in the workplace now and in the future. Obviously, humans have characteristics that robots still don’t have, as we write. If the developers and programmers can find a way to program empathy, compassion and love into the DNA of the robots, the supervisors would be among the endangered species. The surveys tend to send a strong warning. People, especially the young, are willing to work with technology, especially in humanoid form, perhaps like Daryl (Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform) in the 1985 movie. People will prefer to have a robot boss if it means getting rid of their bad supervisor. To good supervisors, I say that there’s still a niche for you.

When the sun goes down, the stars will come out. – Anon THE pandemic has punctuated our equilibrium. Applied to various life areas such as in the disciplines — in physics, psychology, economics, management, etc., the term “equilibrium” means balance. Physics-wise, if the resultant of forces on opposite sides of the lever is zero, then there is equilibrium. This pandemic: A punctuated equilibrium. We are witnessing a punctuated equilibrium that has slammed aspects of life. Supply and demand such as for food and health out balance each other; unstable prices of such goods results. Psychology-wise, our mental schemata do not fit the actual environment we are in, be this in our cultural, physical or social environment. Our expectations based on the normal life we knew are incredibly incompatible with the new normal life the pandemic brought about. We need cognitive equilibrium to provide us an intellectual and emotional balance. The social distancing protocols and economic concerns caused by Covid-19 have imposed on us feelings of personal isolation and uncertainty. Obviously, to keep our sanity, we do need equilibrium. Punctuated equilibrium. As we try to calm our nerves in adjusting to this new normal, what can we do to redirect this seismic change? Let us draw understanding of this pandemic from the origin of what paleontologists identified as punctuated equilibrium (PE). The data base explains that there were five PE’s in the last 500 million years. It was a huge meteor or volcanic fury or both, as earth history explains, that caused the ecosystem to change drastically causing the dinosaurs to die. There were a few cold-blooded reptile survivors including crocodiles, but the new ecosystem favored the warm-blooded mammals. Why, because they were able to adapt to the severe weather changes. The PE theory “brings about change,” “after long periods of stability in the characteristics of an organism.” Then comes “short periods of rapid change during which new forms appear.” <dictionary. cambridge.org › dictionary › english › punct…> Similarly, in this pandemic, we are experiencing drastic change. “So, what should be our response to this equilibrium that has been punctuated in our ecosystem? Are we like dinosaurs, or mammals?” Why did the mammals thrive, besides luck? The answer is “Adaptability, adaptability and adaptability.” <www.thoughtworks. com › insights › blog › surviving-o..>. Adapting, would mean a change — a change in us? The equilibrium we need. It is not only a change on market forces that we would seek in the next stage of this pandemic. After a few months of relative calm, “we’ve started to see some striking evolution” of the virus. Biologist Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle wrote of the new strains on Twitter last week. <www.manila times.net › 2021/01/ 20 › news › national>. Unlettered about viruses, most of us did not expect the rise of Covid-19 mutations. They imply an uncertain end of the pandemic, threatening everyone’s psychological health. Gripped with constant fear of contracting the virus or its mutations, we worry over total loss of livelihood, disruption of quality education, a prolonged restriction of social contact, and a host of other uncertainties. Anxiety and/or depression impacts on us both as individuals and on our communities. To lift our spirits, let us count on the positives — the communal spirit of the Filipino which has openly asserted itself many times over. The nimble way is another welcomed change, unlike in prepandemic days, of more government departments in attending to healthcare, education and work interventions to battle with stress and sickness. While physical distance protocol narrows our social life, let’s be thankful for more time we gain for family, creating meaningful relations that we may have failed to nurture due to our professional activities. And thanks for increased awareness to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases emissions. All these positive developments, we hope would be sustained as we, with much uncertainty, try to adapt to the new normal. Redirecting punctuated equilibrium. Unlike the dinosaurs during the biological PT, we are not experiencing evolving physically. Thankfully, we had temporary stability during massive lockdowns, making us quite used to quarantines; some businesses and tourist spots were allowed to open. However, this short-lived seemingly stable phase, being disturbed by the new pandemic strains coming down on hapless victims, is robbing us of hope that some good change is near at hand. The change we hope for, amidst this massive global-wide uncertainty, is a stable state if there will be. Sadly, the PT theory considered, it proved to be short-lived, punctuated. Thus, to calm our fears, let us stay resilient; hold tight to optimism. Nurture a sense of control. Converse with ourselves. Keep tab of [our] own emotions.” Let’s stay connected with our own family and friends. Bond with the wider community. Extend help where we can. Hold on to hope and faith. This is a challenging phase of the equilibrium. But out of this experience, there comes learning that can “help us build a bridge to the future that is beyond this current crisis.” <www.continuousbreakthruz.com› blog › punctuated-e…> Hold on to our faith and hope in Him. “And when such a future comes, let us be ready and willing to embrace the change.” Putting our heart and mind on this change could be the beginning of a creative tension to initiate a healthy transformation. “There will be no normal to come back to because it is us who will have changed! Our perspectives will have shifted.” In such a punctuated equilibrium, there still is a future to build! Email: ttumapon@liceo.edu.ph",Manila Times

In an interview with state-run PTV-4, Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) was crafting the do’s and don’ts for the possible transition to “new normal” of areas with zero transmission in the past month. “‘Yan naman po talaga ay napagusapan na ng ating IATF at ang inaantay lang po natin ay yung mga do’s and don’ts (That is being discussed by the IATF and we are just waiting for the dos and don’ts),” Roque said when asked of possibly declaring some areas under the “new normal.” Roque, who is also with the IATF, said he would raise again the declaration of the “new normal” in some areas when they meet again. “Hayaan niyo po, sa susunod na IATF [meeting] ay bubuksan ko po muli itong usapin na ito dahil tayo po talaga yung nag move na magdeklara na tayo ng new normal sa mga lugar na wala na pong transmission ng Covid-19 (Don’t worry, in the next IATF meeting, I will once again open this topic because we are the one that moved to declare new normal in areas that no longer have Covid-19 transmission),” he said. “Meron naman po tayong mga lugar na natigil na po ang transmission ng Covid-19 (There are now areas where the Covid-19 transmission already stopped),” he added, without providing other details as to which areas in the country have no coronavirus transmissions. The “new normal” classification used to be the fifth, lowest quarantine classification before the IATF removed it in June. According to IATF’s guidelines on the implementation of community quarantine, “new normal” refers to “emerging behaviors, situations, and minimum public health standards that will be institutionalized in common or routine practices and remain even after the pandemic while the disease is not totally eradicated through means such as widespread immunization.” “These include actions that will become second nature to the general public as well as policies such as bans on large gatherings that will continue to remain in force,” it added. To date, there are only four levels of community quarantine: enhanced community quarantine, which is the strictest; modified enhanced community quarantine, general community quarantine (GCQ), and the modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). For the month of February, areas under GCQ are Metro Manila, Cordillera Administrative Region, Batangas, Tacloban City, Iligan City, Davao del Norte, Davao City, and Lanao del Sur. The rest of the country is currently under MGCQ, the most lenient quarantine classification and the phase before the “new normal.” Current community quarantine classifications are set to lapse after February 28. As of Monday, the country has over 550,000 cases of the coronavirus. Over 510,000 have recovered, while more than 11,000 have died from the disease.",Manila Times

Viruses mutate constantly and it takes just the right combination of particular mutations to escape vaccination. But studies are raising concern that first-generation Covid-19 vaccines don’t work as well against a mutant that first emerged in South Africa as they do against other versions circulating around the world. The good news: Many of the new Covid-19 vaccines are made with new, flexible technology that’s easy to upgrade. What’s harder: Deciding if the virus has mutated enough that it’s time to modify vaccines — and what changes to make. “When do you pull the trigger?” asked Norman Baylor, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief. “This is a moving target right now.” The WHO and FDA are looking to the global flu vaccine system in deciding how to handle similar decisions about Covid-19 shots. Influenza mutates much faster than the coronavirus, and flu shots have to be adjusted just about every year. National centers around the globe collect circulating flu viruses and track how they’re evolving. They send samples to WHO-designated labs for more sophisticated “antigenic” testing to determine vaccine strength. The WHO and regulators then agree on the year’s vaccine recipe and manufacturers get to work. For Covid-19 vaccines, Webby said a critical step is establishing a similar surveillance and testing network to flag the mutations that matter. Today, there’s wide geographic variability in tracking and testing mutated versions. For example, Britain does more testing of the changing viral genome than the United States. Three variants first discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil are worrisome because of combinations of mutations that make them more contagious. On Sunday, US researchers reported a still different mutation found in seven variants that have cropped up in several states. No one yet knows if this mutation makes the virus easier to spread but the report, not yet vetted by other scientists, urges further research to find out. In this Jan. 22, 2021 file photo, empty vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine are seen at a vaccination center at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. AP PHOTO Just because a variant is more contagious doesn’t mean it also will be impervious to vaccination. But the variant first identified in South Africa is raising concerns. Columbia University’s David Ho put blood samples from people given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines into lab dishes with the mutated virus. Vaccine-produced antibodies still protected, but they were much less potent. Preliminary test results of two other vaccine candidates — from Novavax and Johnson & Johnson — soon backed up those findings. Both still protected but were weaker when tested in South Africa, where that variant dominates, than when tested elsewhere. A far smaller test of the AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa has raised questions about its effect. “If the virus were able to make an additional mutation or two, it could escape even more,” Ho warned. If fully immunized people start getting hospitalized with mutated virus, “that’s when the line gets crossed,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia vaccine expert who advises the FDA. That hasn’t happened yet, but “we should get ready,” he added. Moderna is about to explore one option: Could a third dose of the original vaccine boost immunity enough to fend off some variants even if it’s not an exact match? Columbia’s Ho said it’s a good idea to test because people may “still have plenty of cushion” if their overall antibody levels are very high. In this Jan. 22, 2021 file photo, Tina Killebrew, a certified medical assistant, prepares a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. AP PHOTO Major manufacturers also are developing experimental variant vaccines, just in case. Covid-19 vaccines produce antibodies that recognize the spike protein that coats the coronavirus. When the virus mutates, sometimes the spike protein is changed in key areas so the vaccine-produced antibodies have a harder time recognizing it. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are made with a piece of genetic code called messenger RNA that tells the body how to make some harmless copies of the spike protein that train immune cells. To update the vaccine, they can simply change the payload: swap out the original genetic code with mRNA for the mutated spike protein. The AstraZeneca vaccine and the Johnson & Johnson shot expected to roll out soon are made with cold viruses engineered to sneak a spike protein gene into the body. Adjusting their vaccines requires growing cold viruses with the mutated gene, a little more complex than the mRNA approach but not nearly as laborious as reformulating old-fashioned flu shots. The Novavax vaccine also in final-stage testing is made with a lab-grown copy of the spike protein that also could be tweaked to match mutations. First-generation Covid-19 vaccines were tested in tens of thousands of people to be sure they work and are safe — research that took many months. Simply changing the recipe to better target virus mutations won’t require repeating those studies in thousands of people, Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s vaccine chief, recently told the American Medical Association. FDA still is finalizing requirements, but Marks said the agency intends to “be pretty nimble.” If an updated vaccine is needed, tests in a few hundred people likely would be enough to tell if it triggers a good immune response, he said. But an even bigger question: If only some places face vaccine-resistant virus mutants, would authorities want variant-only shots or vaccines that protect against two kinds in one jab? After all, flu vaccines protect against three or four different types in one shot. Companies would first have to perform some basic research to be sure a variant-only version properly revs up the immune system, said the Immunization Action Coalition’s John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive. Then a combination shot would need more testing to be sure there’s an equal response to both types.",Manila Times

He said as many people as possible should be vaccinated before they come into contact with any of the new variants of the virus.

Experts say it’s likely that some version of the disease will linger for years. But what it will look like in the future is less clear. Will the coronavirus, which has already killed more than 2 million people worldwide, eventually be eliminated by a global vaccination campaign, like smallpox? Will dangerous new variants evade vaccines? Or will the virus stick around for a long time, transforming into a mild annoyance, like the common cold? Eventually, the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 will become yet “another animal in the zoo,” joining the many other infectious diseases that humanity has learned to live with, predicted Dr. T. Jacob John, who studies viruses and was at the helm of India’s efforts to tackle polio and HIV/AIDS.

Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) But no one knows for sure. The virus is evolving rapidly, and new variants are popping up in different countries. The risk of these new variants was underscored when Novavax Inc. found that the company’s vaccine did not work as well against mutated versions circulating in Britain and South Africa. The more the virus spreads, experts say, the more likely it is that a new variant will become capable of eluding current tests, treatments and vaccines. For now, scientists agree on the immediate priority: Vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible. The next step is less certain and depends largely on the strength of the immunity offered by vaccines and natural infections and how long it lasts. “Are people going to be frequently subject to repeat infections? We don’t have enough data yet to know,” said Jeffrey Shaman, who studies viruses at Columbia University. Like many researchers, he believes chances are slim that vaccines will confer lifelong immunity. If humans must learn to live with Covid-19, the nature of that coexistence depends not just on how long immunity lasts, but also how the virus evolves. Will it mutate significantly each year, requiring annual shots, like the flu? Or will it pop up every few years? This question of what happens next attracted Jennie Lavine, a virologist at Emory University, who is co-author of a recent paper in Science that projected a relatively optimistic scenario: After most people have been exposed to the virus — either through vaccination or surviving infections — the pathogen “will continue to circulate, but will mostly cause only mild illness,” like a routine cold. While immunity acquired from other coronaviruses — like those that cause the common cold or SARS or MERS — wanes over time, symptoms upon reinfection tend to be milder than the first illness, said Ottar Bjornstad, a co-author of the Science paper who studies viruses at Pennsylvania State University. “Adults tend not to get very bad symptoms if they’ve already been exposed,” he said.  FILE – In this Nov. 12, 2020, file photo, people walk in a market to shop ahead of the Diwalli festival in New Delhi, India. Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File) The prediction in the Science paper is based on an analysis of how other coronaviruses have behaved over time and assumes that SAR-CoV-2 continues to evolve, but not quickly or radically. The 1918 flu pandemic could offer clues about the course of Covid-19. That pathogen was an H1N1 virus with genes that originated in birds, not a coronavirus. At the time, no vaccines were available. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a third of the world’s population became infected. Eventually, after infected people either died or developed immunity, the virus stopped spreading quickly. It later mutated into a less virulent form, which experts say continues to circulate seasonally. “Very commonly the descendants of flu pandemics become the milder seasonal flu viruses we experience for many years,” said Stephen Morse, who studies viruses at Columbia University. It’s not clear yet how future mutations in SARS-CoV-2 will shape the trajectory of the current disease. As new variants emerge — some more contagious, some more virulent and some possibly less responsive to vaccines — scientists are reminded how much they don’t yet know about the future of the virus, said Mark Jit, who studies viruses at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We’ve only known about this virus for about a year, so we don’t yet have data to show its behavior over five years or 10 years,” he said. Of the more than 12 billion coronavirus vaccine shots being made in 2021, rich countries have bought about 9 billion, and many have options to buy more. This inequity is a threat since it will result in poorer countries having to wait longer for the vaccine, during which time the disease will continue to spread and kill people, said Ian MacKay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland. A couple walk along a boulevard in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2021. Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) That some vaccines seem less effective against the new strains is worrisome, but since the shots provide some protection, vaccines could still be used to slow or stop the virus from spreading, said Ashley St. John, who studies immune systems at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India, said the evolution of the virus raises new questions: At what stage does the virus become a new strain? Will countries need to re-vaccinate from scratch? Or could a booster dose be given? “These are questions that you will have to address in the future,” Kang said. The future of the coronavirus may contrast with other highly contagious diseases that have been largely beaten by vaccines that provide lifelong immunity — such as measles. The spread of measles drops off after many people have been vaccinated. But the dynamic changes over time with new births, so outbreaks tend to come in cycles, explained Dr. Jayaprakash Muliyil, who studies epidemics and advises India on virus surveillance. Unlike measles, kids infected with Covid-19 don’t always exhibit clear symptoms and could still transmit the disease to vulnerable adults. That means countries cannot let their guard down, he said. Another unknown is the long-term impact of Covid-19 on patients who survive but are incapacitated for months, Kang said. The “quantification of this damage” — how many people can’t do manual labor or are so exhausted that they can’t concentrate — is key to understanding the full consequences of the disease. “We haven’t had a lot of diseases that have affected people on a scale like this,” she said.",Manila Times

There is also hate. In this image from video, Michael van der Veen, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, answers a question from Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., during the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Friday, Feb. 12, 2021. AP PHOTO US media recently reported an alarming increase of hate crimes committed against Asians and Asian Americans. These reports follow nearly a year’s worth of news about Black Lives Matter protests against the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, two of the many African Americans killed by law enforcers. Earlier this year, America, along with the rest of the world, was also shocked by protestors storming the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of its presidential elections. They were successful, but only for a short while. Now, the immediate past US president Donald Trump is on trial after his second impeachment. Not a few are also blaming Mr. Trump for the increase in hate crimes. By referring to Covid-19 as the China or Wuhan virus, the former president may have made Asians and Asian Americans the target of violence, as well as bigotry and xenophobia. Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University, told USA Today, “When President Trump began and insisted on using the term ‘China virus,’ we saw that hate speech really led to hate violence.” He added, “That sort of political rhetoric and that sort of anti-Asian climate has continued to this day.” Jeung created a tracker to monitor hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). His website, Stop AAPI Hate, recorded some 2,500 discrimination cases across the United States from March to August 2020. USA Today reported recently that the figure had risen to 2,808 by yearend. Other groups tracking those hate crimes corroborate the trend. The AAPI website said the most common type of discrimination was verbal harassment and name calling, 70.6 percent of the reports. Physical assault, the fourth most common type, represented 8.7 percent of the reported incidents. The victims varied from children to the elderly. The plurality of those reporting the incidents were ethnically Chinese, 40.4 percent and those of Filipino ethnicity, 7.6 percent. The same USA Today story mentioned a Filipino American, 61-year-old Noel Quintana, who suffered facial lacerations after he was attacked on the New York City subway by someone wielding a box cutter. There is worse. Earlier in January, an 84-year-old Thai living in San Francisco died after he was assaulted by someone who earlier shouted, “Go back to China.” Trump trial In fairness to Mr. Trump, he did make at least one public statement appealing for the safety of Asians and Pacific Islanders. But that was obviously too little. Also, it would be wrong to assign all the blame on the former president. Discrimination against Asians in America dates back to when Chinese immigrants were recruited to work on the US railroads. And who can forget the internment of Japanese Americans during World War 2? German Americans and other citizens descended from European countries that fought the United States did not suffer similar persecution. Still, that does not excuse Mr. Trump from stoking hate. He may be on trial for inciting an insurrection, but we hope that the US Senate finds him guilty for symbolic reasons. That may not happen, of course. As local politicians say, impeachment is a numbers game. For now, the Democrats do not seem to have the numbers needed to convict. But we still hope that US senators will vote not based on loyalty to one man but on moral principles and democratic values. As mentioned, perpetrating hate is not among the articles of impeachment. And if even Mr. Trump lost, the majority of the 74 million Americans who voted for him in 2020 still cling to lies, not only about the US elections but also about the pandemic and its economic impact. We recognize that US President Joseph Biden is rolling back many of his predecessor’s policies. By voting guilty, the US Senate reinforces the signal that America can transcend party politics and bring back decency.

The country also reported another 758 coronavirus-related deaths. The total number of coronavirus-related deaths in Britain now stands at 116,287. These figures only include the deaths of people who died within 28 days of their first positive test. The latest figures were revealed as Britain’s coronavirus R0 or reproduction number, also known as the R number, has fallen to below one for the first time since July 2020. The figure is now between 0.7 and 0.9, down from between 0.7 and 1.0 last week, according to the British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The R number represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above one, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below one it means the epidemic is shrinking. Meanwhile, Britain is stepping up efforts to speed up vaccine roll-out to bring the pandemic under control. More than 14 million people in Britain have been given the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest official figures. Britain aims to complete the vaccination of the top priority groups, which cover 15 million people, by mid-February. Downing Street has confirmed that all British adults aged 50 and older are expected to be offered a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine by early May. Britain aims to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. England is currently under the third national lockdown since the outbreak of the pandemic in the country. Similar restriction measures are also in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Germany, Russia and the United States have been racing against time to roll out coronavirus vaccines.",Manila Times

Neither of us could do what we do without the other. Unicef’s success is WHO’s success, and we are proud to be your partner on so many issues: Ebola, polio, maternal health, nutrition, infection prevention and control, primary healthcare — the list is long. Never has our partnership been more important than it is now. The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our world in ways we could never have imagined when it started just over a year ago. It’s sobering to think that on this day 12 months ago, more than 3,000 new cases of Covid-19 were reported to WHO. Yesterday (Feb. 10, 2021), 3,000 cases were reported every 15 minutes. The pandemic has held a mirror up to our world. It has shown humanity at its best and worst. It has exposed and exploited the fault lines, inequalities, injustices and contradictions of our world, within and between countries. The pandemic has also become a child emergency, with children bearing both its direct and indirect consequences. Children suffer
Children may be at lower risk of severe disease and death from Covid-19, but they have suffered many of the most severe social and economic consequences and will bear a large burden of the long-term fallout. Many children have missed out on months of schooling and have been exposed to a greater risk of violence. Girls are especially at risk in places where they may never go back to school, as they approach the age when they will go to work or be married. Since the beginning, Unicef has been, and will continue to be, an indispensable partner in ensuring that children are a primary consideration in the global response to Covid-19. Together, we have engaged, empowered and communicated with communities about the risks of Covid-19 and how to stay safe. We have developed joint guidance for the prevention and control of Covid-19 in schools; We’ve supported health workers with improved infection prevention and control, and we’ve supported them to deliver better care and psycho-social support for patients, their families and communities; we’ve procured and delivered essential supplies; We’ve provided the joint analytics that are key to an effective pandemic response; we’ve supported countries to maintain essential health services, including in humanitarian settings; And through the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator and Covax, we are poised for the largest vaccination campaign in history. Vaccines are the shot in the arm we all need, literally and metaphorically. But we must also remember that vaccines will complement, not replace, the proven public health measures that countries around the world have used successfully to prevent and contain widespread transmission. As governments, institutions and individuals, we all have a role to play in stopping this pandemic with the tools we have. The pandemic will subside, but the inequalities that preceded it will still be there. Respond, recover, rebuild
There’s no vaccine for climate change, poverty or malnutrition. None of these challenges can be met by a single agency. Let me outline three areas in which the partnership between WHO and Unicef, bilaterally and through the Global Action Plan on Health and Well-Being for All, must become even deeper and stronger as we work together to support countries to respond, recover and rebuild. First, as we support countries to respond to the pandemic, we must ensure that all people and communities enjoy equitable access to life-saving vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics — rich and poor, urban and rural, citizen and refugee. A year ago, we were defenseless against this virus. Now we can detect it with rapid diagnostic tests, we can treat it with dexamethasone and oxygen, and we can prevent it with vaccines. The urgency, ambition and resources with which vaccines have been developed must be matched by the same urgency, ambition and resources to distribute them fairly. Unicef has played a vital role in procuring vaccines and preparing countries to deploy them rapidly once they receive them. Together, we have supported 124 countries to perform readiness assessments for vaccination. But we face significant challenges. More than 130 million doses of vaccine have now been deployed globally, but 75 percent of them have been in only 10 countries that account for 60 percent of global GDP. Meanwhile, almost 130 countries, with 2.5 billion people, have yet to administer a single dose. Many of these countries are also struggling to secure the resources for testing, personal protective equipment, oxygen and medicines. I have issued a call to action to ensure that by World Health Day on April 7, vaccination of health workers is under way in all countries. Unicef can play a key role in meeting that challenge. As a trusted advocate, you can use your voice and experience in communities to build acceptance of vaccines; You can deploy your unparalleled logistics and supply capacities to deliver vaccines to the last mile. You can negotiate the best deals for the communities you serve. And you can mobilize your networks of national committees to resource this historic effort to save lives and livelihoods. Second, as we support countries to recover from the pandemic, we must support them to maintain essential health services, including routine immunization for children. The pandemic has shown that we can only meet the major crises of our time with a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach. In the same way, the challenges of child development can only be met with a multi-sectoral approach that addresses their access to services, their mental health and well-being, their nutrition, their risk factors for developing NCDs later in life, their educational outcomes, their chances on employment, and their need to be protected from violence. And third, as we support countries to rebuild from the pandemic, we must invest in primary health care. The pandemic has given us a brutal reminder of the importance of primary health care, as the eyes and ears of every health system, and the foundation of universal health coverage. Ultimately, our fight is not against a single virus. Our fight is against the inequalities that leave children in some countries exposed to deadly diseases that are easily prevented in others. Our fight is against the inequalities that mean women and their babies die during childbirth in some countries because of complications that are easily prevented in others. And our fight is to ensure that health is no longer a commodity or a luxury item, but a fundamental human right, and the foundation of the safer, fairer and more sustainable world we all want. History will not judge us solely by how we ended the Covid-19 pandemic, but what we learned, what we changed, and the future we left our children.

Dr. Alethea de Guzman of the department’s Epidemiology Bureau said based on the overall caseload, the national Covid-19 growth rate has dropped a bit and the healthcare utilization rate for all regions is in the safe zone. The number of severe and critical cases has also gone down, from 8 to 9 percent a few months ago to just 5 percent this month. De Guzman said there was a minor surge in the middle of January because of increased mobility and crowd gatherings during the holiday season. The DoH said while that the two-week growth rate and the average daily attack rate have gone down in the past few weeks, three regions — Cagayan Valley, Central Visayas, Soccsksargen (South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani, and General Santos City) and Caraga — posted positive growth rates in the past weeks, placing them under moderate risk. In Cagayan Valley, the increase was observed in Cagayan and Isabela provinces and Santiago City. In Central Visayas, Cebu province, including the cities of Cebu, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue, are experiencing a steep rise in cases. Caraga, Agusan del Norte and Dinagat Island were the only areas with a dropping number of cases. Other priority areas flagged by the DoH are Naga City, Mountain Province, Kalinga, Baguio City, Compostela Valley, Tacloban City, Davao City, Benguet, Makati City, Ifugao, Davao del Norte, Lanao del Sur and Bataan. “Kahit na maliit na numero ito, fina-flag na namin (Even if the number of cases are small, we are flagging this) because spikes in cases can start very small, we do not want them to reach high numbers again,” de Guzman said. The number of Covid-19 deaths rose slightly to 2.11 percent due to the continuing harmonization of data together with the Philippine Statistics Authority, de Guzman said. Meanwhile, Dr. Guido David of the Octa Research Group has warned that if the uptrend in Cebu City continues, the city’s hospital bed capacity will exceed the current 850 beds, with occupancy reaching up to 1,200 by March 1. The country logged 1,734 Covid cases on Thursday, for a total of 543,282 cases. The DoH also said it has traced the lone case of the new Covid-19 variant who listed Liloan, Cebu, as his hometown, in Quezon City, where he is now isolated. The Quezon City government said the 35-year-old male moved to Sucat, Parañaque City and made frequent visits to his manning agency in Malate, Manila. His last visit was on
January 14 after he secured another overseas placement. While waiting for deployment, the man rode a cab and stayed in a hotel in Manila on January 17, where he took a swab test. His results returned positive the same day and his sample was sent to the Philippine Genome Center until January 21, when his agency booked a ride-hailing cab and transferred him to an apartment in Riverside in Commonwealth, Quezon City. The genome sequencing results released on February 5 showed that he was positive for the B117 variant. Three days later, he developed a mild cough. De Guzman said the patient, a former overseas Filipino worker, traveled from Cebu to Manila to process his papers. He added that because of the patient’s mobility, the case investigation now involves several cities where he made his contacts.",Manila Times

Octa Research said Covid-19 cases have spiked in Cebu City since February 1, and if the trend would continue, its hospital capacity would reach critical levels in two weeks. From February 1 to 7, the city averaged 123 new cases per day, 30 percent higher than the 94 cases recorded from January 25 to 31. Its positivity rate also increased to 10 percent and its attack rate to 11.11 per 100,000 population. Neighboring Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu cities also saw spikes, with positivity rates above 10 percent. The group warned that the hospital occupancy in the province might reach 70 percent in two weeks if the current transmission rate of R0 (R-naught) 1.4 and a hospitalization rate of 25 to 35 percent holds. Octa said the increase in the number of cases in the city may be attributed to the presence of the more infectious B117 variant, which was detected in Liloan, Cebu. The Department of Health (DoH) acknowledged that there was an increase in the number of cases in the city but said the spike might not be because of the spread of the new variant that originated in the United Kingdom. “Hindi ho natin masasabi na variant lang ang cause. [Maaring] naka aggravate or makasama sya sa (We can’t say that this variant is the cause. There could be other things that have aggravated it or there were other) factors but it is not the only cause of the numbers increasing in Cebu. Marami pa pong factors ‘yan (There are many factors),” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said. She said other factors such as gatherings held during the holidays and delays in consultation, wherein some people take three to five days to consult doctors for symptoms after they got exposed to a close Covid-19 contact, could also be behind the spike. Vergeire said the One Hospital Command in Cebu City is managing the situation to prevent a possible surge in hospital care capacity. Octa said the National Capital Region continues to see a flattening trend in the number of Covid-19 cases despite having an R0 of1.02 and an average of 360 new cases per day. Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) and Central Luzon had decreased their positivity rate to 5 and 4 percent, respectively, while Davao’s case numbers were also decreasing. Meanwhile, the DoH sought the help of the National Bureau of Investigation to locate a patient with the B117 variant who listed Liloan, Cebu as his hometown to determine his date of exit and see if he had indeed left the country. It is also set to sequence more than 700 samples from the National Capital Region, Calabarzon, Cordillera and Central Visayas to see if there were more cases of the new variant. Vergeire earlier said that the vaccines from the Covax Facility, which consists of the first batch of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech tozinameran vaccine, might arrive on February 13. It will only take two to three days upon arrival for the vaccines to be administered to frontliners in health facilities. The Health Technology Assessment Council gave its approval for the use of tozinameran and AstraZeneca’s AZD1222 vaccines. In its assessment reports released on Feb. 2 and 8, 2021, respectively, the council said both vaccines passed its appraisals. On Wednesday, the DoH logged 1,345 new cases of Covid-19, for a total of 541,560 total cases, of which 30,188 are active. Priority The DoH also said it was open to the proposal of Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go to include national athletes in the vaccine priority list. Go urged the government to vaccinate national athletes who would compete in international sporting competitions this year such as the Olympics and the Southeast Asian Games.

Besides the unprecedented challenges and risks of developing, testing, procuring, transporting, storing, and administering vaccines within extremely tight time frames to billions of people — everything never been done before — there’s the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which have been happening since the virus first spread from Wuhan, Central China, over a year ago, may make it deadlier and harder to stop, even with immunization. Indeed, a new British study now undergoing peer review has calculated a 30-percent greater death risk from the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B117, first detected in the United Kingdom last September and found in at least 70 countries, including the Philippines, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in late January. This greater fatality risk could be as high as 35 percent. That means if past coronavirus strains killed 1,000 people a day, the new one could snuff out 1,350 lives, according to the study by the Center for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250959v1). The CMMID researchers estimated “that the hazard of death among SGTF [or B117] cases is 30 percent … higher than among non-SGTF cases after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation level, care home residence, local authority of residence and date of test.” And taking account of misclassification of UK-variant patients, the estimated fatality risk would be 35 percent more. What’s worse, there are signs in a small number of UK cases that the British variant may have a mutation first seen in the South African and Brazilian variants, which makes the coronavirus less vulnerable to antibodies produced by people with Covid-19 or vaccination. If confirmed by more data from a wider range of cases, this additional mutation, called E484K, would make B117, which is already more transmissible by as much as 70 percent, also more resistant to immunization. In short, Covid-19 is getting deadlier and harder to stop. Wear masks and find cures
These findings are still being validated by more research. But strategic risk analysis would point to two likely and worrisome trends. First, more infectious variants like B117 will eventually predominate, since it infects more people and spreads faster than the older strains. Moreover, mutations resistant to antibodies would also become prevalent, since more of such strains survive than past ones. Indeed, as immunization spreads, resistant variants would become dominant sooner since the nonresistant ones would die out faster due to vaccinations. These risk factors underscore the imperative that the world continue mask wearing and other prevention protocols and work not only on vaccines but also cures, especially for severe cases that fill hospitals and morgues. The provision of Covid-19 remedies would also consume far less resources than vaccination. For one thing, severe cases requiring medical treatment constitute just a tiny fraction of the population, while vaccination must cover more than half the nation for it to prevent massive deaths. Moreover, a number of remedies have been developed by repurposing existing medications like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which are often cheap compared with newly developed vaccines. And the side effects of these formulations are already well known, so they can be prescribed with proper safeguards. And if the state expands intensive care units and ventilators nationwide, these facilities would be of use for years and for other illnesses besides Covid-19, unlike vaccines. Hence, in its pandemic responses and budgeting, the government must give as much consideration to medical treatment of the thousands of severe Covid-19 cases as rolling out vaccines for tens of millions of Filipinos, purchased with many billions of dollars in loans which would burden the economy for many years. For this reason, we commend the Department of Science and Technology and its Philippine Council for Health Research and Development for their programs and funding to develop local Covid-19 remedies. One that this writer is involved with is the formulation and testing of a drug combining the anti-inflammatory medicine methylprednisolone and the anesthetic procaine, pushed by Covid cure advocate Ruby Ann Kagaoan and undertaken by the De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute in Dasmariñas, Cavite, and the University of the Philippines College of Pharmacy in Manila. Plainly, with vaccines not only hugely expensive and difficult to deploy, but also unsure of success due to coronavirus mutations, the Philippines must make sure to develop and deploy medication and facilities for severely ill Covid-19 patients, who will continue to be among us, vaccines or no vaccines.",Manila Times

A closely watched visit by World Health Organization (WHO) experts to Wuhan — the Chinese city where the first coronavirus cases were discovered — did not dramatically change the current understanding of the early days of the pandemic, said Peter Ben Embarek, the leader of the WHO mission. But it did “add details to that story,” he said at a news conference as the group wrapped up a four-week visit to the city. And it allowed the joint Chinese-WHO team to further explore the lab leak theory — which former US President Donald Trump and officials from his administration had put forward without evidence — and decide it was unlikely. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is home to many different virus samples, leading to allegations that it may have been the source of the original outbreak, whether on purpose or accidentally. Peter Ben Embarek of the World Health Organization team holds up a chart showing pathways of transmission of the virus during a joint press conference held at the end of the WHO mission in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province on Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Embarek, a WHO food safety and animal disease expert, said experts now consider the possibility of such a leak so improbable that it will not be suggested as an avenue of future study. But another team member, Danish scientist Thea Koelsen Fischer, told reporters that team members could not rule out the possibility of further investigation and new leads. China had already strongly rejected the possibility of a leak and has promoted other theories. The Chinese and foreign experts considered several ideas for how the disease first ended up in humans, leading to a pandemic that has now killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide. Embarek said the initial findings suggest the most likely pathway the virus followed was from a bat to another animal and then to humans, adding that would require further research. “The findings suggest that the laboratory incidents hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus to the human population,” he said. Liang Wannian, the head of the Chinese side, noted that there was no sample of the virus that causes Covid-19 in the lab — and thus it could not have come from there. The mission was intended to be an initial step in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, which scientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat. Transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, Embarek said. The WHO team’s visit is politically sensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. An AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and ordered scientists not to speak to reporters.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Still, one member of the WHO team, British-born zoologist Peter Daszak, told The Associated Press last week that they enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested. Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries. The team — which includes experts from 10 countries who arrived on Jan. 14 — visited the Huanan Seafood Market, the site of an early cluster of cases in late 2019. Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist on the team, said that some animals at the market were susceptible or suspected to be susceptible to the virus, including rabbits and bamboo rats. And some could be traced to farms or traders in regions that are home to the bats that carry the closest related virus to the one that causes Covid-19. She said the next step would be to look more closely at farms. Liang, the head of the Chinese team, said the virus also appeared to have been spreading in parts of the city other than the market, so it remains possible that the virus originated elsewhere.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) The team found no evidence that the disease was spreading widely any earlier than the initial outbreak in the second half of December 2019. “We haven’t been able to fully do the research, but there is no indication there were clusters before what we saw happen in the later part of December in Wuhan,” Liang said. The visit by the WHO team took months to negotiate. China only agreed to it amid international pressure at the WHO’s World Health Assembly meeting last May, and Beijing has continued to resist calls for a strictly independent investigation. While China has weathered some localized resurgences of infection since getting the outbreak under control last year, life in Wuhan itself has largely returned to normal.",Manila Times

Scientists have agreed for some time the main way the virus is spread is through the air, rather than surfaces, and there’s growing evidence that small droplets from ordinary breathing and speech that can travel many meters (yards) are a common mode of transmission. Added to this is the greater contagiousness of emerging variants, like B.1.1.7, which takes a smaller viral load to cause symptomatic Covid-19 compared to the more common strain. Back when authorities first recommended people wear face coverings, proper masks were in extremely short supply and the public was encouraged to fashion makeshift solutions out of T-shirts or bandanas. But these are far from ideal. Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, who studies airborne disease transmission, told Agence France-Presse: “How well a mask works depends on two things: filtration and fit. “Good filtration removes as many particles as possible, and a good fit means that there are no leaks around the sides of your mask, where air — and viruses — can leak through,” she said, adding even a small gap could lead to a 50 percent reduction in performance. The best materials for blocking small particles include non-woven polypropylene, which is used to make N95s and many surgical-type masks, and the HEPA filters in planes. Among fabrics, tightly woven cotton works best, she added. This illustration shows a woman wearing two facemasks, a cloth mask over a surgical mask, in Arlington, Virginia, on February 8, 2021. AFP PHOTO “If you wear a cloth mask, choose one that has multiple layers, ideally one with a pocket that you can slip a good filter material into,” said Marr. “Or you can double mask by wearing a surgical-type mask with a tight-fitting cloth mask over it.” Surgical masks are made of material that filters things out well, but they tend to be loose, so adding a cloth mask on top holds down the edges and reduces leaks. Adding an additional layer improves filtration —  if one layer traps 50 percent of all particles, combining two gets to 75 percent. But, she added: “We do not recommend wearing more than two masks. Adding more layers proves diminishing returns and can compromise breathability. It must remain easy to breathe through the layers; otherwise, air is more likely to leak in around the sides of the mask.” Masks that have a metal nose bridge help ensure a snug fit, as do straps that tighten around the head, not just the ears. Braces that improve the fit of surgical masks are now available on the market. “You should feel the mask sucking inward when you breathe in, and if you hold your hands around the sides of the mask, you should not feel any air leaking out when you breathe out,” said Marr. In this file photo taken on January 29, 2021 a woman wearing double protective face masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19 waits at a traffic light in Hanoi, a day after Vietnam recorded its first coronavirus outbreak in almost two months. AFP PHOTO Another option is getting hold of N95s, or their international equivalents such as KN95, FFP2 etc. “They all provide a similar level of filtration, meaning protection of particles going in and out,” Ranu Dhillon, a global health physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dhillon, who has been advocating in favor of better masks since last spring, is frustrated by the lack of clear messaging to the public on the value of better masks. What’s more, “there’s not been a concerted push to really mass produce and mass distribute these higher caliber masks.” Health care workers have their masks professionally fit-tested every year to ensure they’re making the right seal, but Dhillon doesn’t see this as a major obstacle. “To teach people to fit a mask, even if not 100 percent perfectly, but more effectively, is something that’s very doable.” In this file photo taken on December 10, 2020 a man wears a double mask as he visits Times Square in New York. AFP PHOTO The key to conceptualizing the threat is to think of cigarette smoke, said Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland. Ventilation definitely helps, but if you’re between a person who is breathing and an exhaust vent, the virus will still reach you — which makes good masks so crucial, he said. Milton and Dhillon are cautiously optimistic that their pleas could soon become policy under the administration of President Joe Biden, and CNN reported last week the US government was working on the first official mask standards. Prior to the pandemic, Milton and other aerosol scientists studying the flu concluded it too is transmitted from tiny droplets from ordinary speaking and breathing, and that the role of sneezing, coughing and transmission from surfaces was smaller than thought. Their findings stirred controversy at the time, but Covid-19 has renewed interest in the research — meaning masks could be a common sight during tough flu seasons, long after the pandemic has receded.

Kalinga Governor Ferdinand Tubban, Photo from Wikipedia In a Facebook post in the provincial government-maintained site, Tubban, who learned of the result on Monday after taking the real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, has asked people with whom he had come into contact with in the past week to observe for signs or symptoms of the virus and to consult a health worker. The governor has called on residents to observe minimum health protocols such as washing hands frequently, wearing face mask and face shield and to observe social distancing. It was not immediately known where the governor got the virus. Due to the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Tabuk City until February 15, the scholarship renewal of grantees has been postponed indefinitely, according to Mayor Darwin Estranero. The grantees, however, were advised to get their grades and enrollment or assessment form and submit them to the Scholarship Office as soon as schools open after the lockdown. Meanwhile, 116 applications are still pending since May 2020 because the Scholarship Office cannot contact the applicants for an interview due to inactive phone numbers. Uncooperative contacts The municipal health office (MHO) of Lubuagan town in Kalinga is faced with the problem of non-cooperative direct contacts of Covid-19 patients. Mayor Charisma Anne Dickpus urged the public to cooperate in the observance of health protocols and to maintain discipline as a way to combat the spread of Covid-19. Dr. Caroline Agyao, MHO chief, said people who knew they have directly interacted with Covid-19 patients refuse to come forward and cooperate and this has been one of their struggles during contact tracing. “We are begging those that had contact with Covid-19 positive patients to submit themselves. This is also for the protection of the elderly and children who are with them in the same house,” Agyao said. She said some also refuse to reveal their contacts and in one instance resulted in the infection of one of their office staff and that all of them had to be quarantined. “Others even hide and when we conduct random testing in areas identified, we find out that there were those infected with the virus,” Agyao said. Agyao said they welcome the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) status of Lubuagan town because it limits the movement of residents and prohibits them from going in and out of the municipality for non-essential travels. “The extension of the MECQ will also provide them ample time to trace all possible contacts of those who turned positive for Covid-19,” she said. Lubuagan town has recorded a total of 59 cases in the municipality since Nov. 20, 2020 with a total of 36 active cases and 23 recoveries as of February 7.",Manila Times

This emerged during a webinar of the French Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, where these company heads highlighted the vital role of sports and mental health in easing the stress caused by the current working environment, which sees many people still working from home. For Dr. Amal Makhloufi Benchouk, Sanofi Philippines general manager and country chairman, keeping a work-life balance is crucial for a sound body and mind. She said it was important to take care of one’s self, especially since the boundary between the workplace and home had been blurred. According to her, some of the things she does to sustain that balance are setting up specific work times; discouraging meetings during lunch breaks; and dedicating her free time to exercising, learning new skills and her family. She said measures that Sanofi had implemented to ensure the health of its employees included adopting a flexible working scheme, setting a specific time for calls to avoid “Zoom fatigue” and regularly working out to promote physical fitness. The company also launched an employee assistance program that aims to provide workers and their families with services like counselling for both personal and professional situations. “As we go on with our daily lives amid the pandemic and beyond, I would like to prescribe a healthy dose of self-care, which I believe is the best medicine for both our mental and physical health,” Benchouk said. Meanwhile, Decathlon Philippines Chief Executive Officer Hans Iff said sports was important in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. According to him, sports could help release positive hormones that could make one feel happier, relaxed and sensible. Iff also shared a few tips that could help people improve their lifestyle, including creating a routine, keeping some moments to themselves and setting reachable targets. One should learn to listen to one’s body and know one’s limitations, according to him as he emphasized the importance of getting good sleep. For Jones Lang LaSalle Country Head and CCI France Philippines President Cristophe Vicic, the pandemic accelerated his company’s well-being strategy for employees. “The JLL vision is that we want our people to feel supported, engaged and healthy,” Vicic said. According to him, this vision is built on four pillars: mental well-being, physical well-being, financial well-being and inclusion in the workplace. Vicic also attested to his experiences in marathons as having helped him in his career and how he applied the principles of preparing for race in his life and career.

The preliminary findings from Oxford University, a co-developer of the vaccine, could vindicate the British government’s controversial strategy of delaying the second shot for up to 12 weeks so that more people can be quickly given a first dose. Up to now, the recommended time between doses has been four weeks. The research could also bring scientists closer to an answer to one of the big questions about the vaccination drive: Will the vaccines actually curb the spread of the coronavirus? It’s not clear what implications, if any, the findings might have for the two other major vaccines being used in the West, Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. In the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, dismissed the idea of deliberately delaying second shots, saying the US will “go by the science” and data from the clinical trials. The two doses of the Pifzer and Moderna vaccines are supposed to be given three and four weeks apart. Still, the research appears to be good news in the desperate effort to arrest the spread of the virus and also suggests a way to ease vaccine shortages and get shots into more arms more quickly. The makers of all three vaccines have said that their shots proved to be anywhere from 70 percent to 95 percent effective in clinical trials in protecting people from illness caused by the virus. But it was unclear whether the vaccines could also suppress transmission of the virus — that is, whether someone inoculated could still acquire the virus without getting sick and spread it to others. As a result, experts have been saying that even people who have been vaccinated should continue to wear masks and keep their distance from others. AstraZeneca vaccine is ready to be used at a homeless shelter in Romford, east London, Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021. The British health service has started to vaccinate “vulnerable” homeless people. In a study by Oxford University, the AstraZeneca vaccine has been shown to reduce transmission of the virus. AP PHOTO Volunteers in the British study underwent regular nasal swabs to check for the coronavirus, a proxy to try to answer the transmission question. The level of virus-positive swabs — combining volunteers who had asymptomatic infection with those who had symptoms — was 67 percent lower in the vaccinated group, the researchers reported. While not a direct measure, “that’s got to have a really beneficial effect on transmission,” Oxford lead researcher Sarah Gilbert told a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences Wednesday. The researchers also looked at how likely people who have been vaccinated are to get a symptom-free infection. In one subset of volunteers, there were 16 asymptomatic infections among the vaccinated and 31 in an unvaccinated comparison group. Pfizer and Moderna also are studying the effect of their vaccines on asymptomatic infections. Only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are being used in the United States. Britain is using both AstraZeneca’s and Pfizer’s. AstraZeneca’s has also been authorized by the 27-nation European Union. Pfizer has not endorsed the British government’s decision to lengthen the time between doses. Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, said that no patients experienced severe Covid-19 or required hospitalization three weeks after receiving a first dose, and that effectiveness appeared to increase up to 12 weeks after the initial shot. “Our data suggest you want to be as close to the 12 weeks as you can” for the second dose, Pangalos said. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the study “backs the strategy that we’ve taken” to make sure more people have gotten at least one shot. Britain’s decision has been criticized as risky by other European countries. Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the study’s suggestion that a single dose protected people for 12 weeks was “useful but not definitive.” Doctor Anil Mehta gives the AstraZeneca vaccine to a homeless person at the homeless accommodation YMCA in Romford, east London, Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021. AP PHOTO He said that the authors themselves acknowledged their research was not designed to investigate the vaccine’s dosing schedule and that their conclusions were based on statistical modeling, not actual patients tracked over time. “It certainly isn’t very strong evidence, but there is also no indication this is the wrong thing to do,” Evans said of Britain’s strategy. One of the Oxford researchers, Dr. Andrew Pollard, said scientists also believe the AstraZeneca vaccine will continue to offer protection against new variants of Covid-19, though they are still waiting for data on that. Fast-spreading mutant versions have caused alarm around the world. “If we do need to update the vaccines, then it is actually a relatively straightforward process. It only takes a matter of months, rather than the huge efforts that everyone went through last year to get the very large-scale trials run,” Pollard told the BBC. Meanwhile, a UN-backed program to supply Covid-19 vaccines to the neediest people worldwide is gearing up after a troubled start. The Covax Facility announced plans Wednesday for an initial distribution of some 100 million doses by the end of March and more than 200 million more by the end of June to dozens of countries. Nearly all of the doses expected for the first phase are due to come from AstraZeneca and its partner, the Serum Institute of India. The rollout will be contingent on the World Health Organization authorizing the AstraZeneca shot for emergency use, which is expected to happen this month. Some 190 countries and territories are participating in Covax, which has seen rich nations scoop up vaccine supplies, sometimes at premium prices. The pandemic’s worldwide death toll has eclipsed 2.2 million, including about 447,000 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New cases per day in the US and the number of Americans in the hospital with Covid-19 have dropped sharply in the past few weeks, but deaths are still running at close to all-time highs at an average of around 3,100 a day. Deaths often lag behind the infection curve, because it can take weeks to sicken and die from Covid-19. As the Super Bowl approaches, Fauci is warning people against inviting others over for Super Bowl parties, urging viewers to “just lay low and cool it” to avoid turning Sunday’s big game into a super spreader event. “You don’t want parties with people that you haven’t had much contact with,” he told NBC’s “Today” show. “You just don’t know if they’re infected.”",Manila Times

The ticking of the clock subdues the usual lively noises of the room, its hands pointing toward the hour and minute of the time being. Dr. Carmina FuentebellaFACEBOOK PHOTO As the sun descends to rest, the moon reigns over the sky and the world is once again cloaked in darkness. Humanity then escorts itself to sleep after long hours of either finding their purpose in life or simply letting time pass by. In their deep slumber, they encounter a series of events psychologically as their physical body enjoys its rest. Their minds wander off to limitless worlds — terrains that could only be seen through closed eyes. The scenes are classified in two categories: delightful dreams and disastrous nightmares. They spend their whole night in those imaginary worlds, but as people say, there are dreams that come into reality. In today’s time, that ticking seems to be slower because of the 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Indeed, it is the nightmare that made its way in the everyday life of humans. Thousands of people become infected everyday, and this global health crisis will continue on until a vaccine is released to the public in support of the declining number of positive cases in the country. Even modern heroes of the Thomasian community – teachers and doctors – are not exempted from this experience, as the darkness of the night once engulfed their skies. At the end of the night is a teacher from the University of Santo Tomas Junior High School (UST JHS) who experienced this nightmare, Frederick Caguioa. He is currently serving as a subject teacher in Mathematics for Grade 7 students and currently leads the Citizenship Advancement Training (CAdT) program for Grade 10 students. On July 19, 2020, he first felt the slight fever that was an indication that he might have contracted the disease. He stated that he slept on their sofa to protect his family and felt that his mind was spinning during the night. “So ang reason for that kasi, I usually go out if I needed to buy something sa Mercury Drug. Importante kasi dahil my wife actually gave birth last March lang, saktong ECQ pa so maliit pa ‘yung baby ko talaga. Eh, I usually go there to buy siyempre, ‘yung gatas. Ang naging problem namin is ‘yung anak ko, nag-diarrhea because of the milk, so we had to really change thrice. ‘Yun pala, kailangan talaga lactose-free na,” said Caguioa in an interview with The Aquinian. The next morning, he immediately looked for an institution that immediately released results, but a 24-hour result test costs P13,000. Caguioa said he already took the test despite the hefty price so that there would be peace and certainty. He prayed overnight that the results would be negative, but unfortunately, he tested positive for Covid-19. As a result, he contacted many people, including his cousin who is a doctor and some alumni of UST JHS, for advice on the steps that he must take as he was Covid-positive. For Caguioa, what made the night even darker was the fact that he was not accommodated by the UST Hospital. He felt both sadness and disappointment, and he was really angry because after all the years he spent in training and honing his young Thomasian students, he was turned down by the university itself on one of the most difficult moments of his life. “I even showed my ID. I even explained to them na I’ve been serving the university for quite some time. Ang word nila sa akin is ‘even sir kung maging critical ‘yung condition ninyo, we really cannot accommodate you here.’ So, I went back to the carpark, went back to my car and really prayed. Ano bang gagawin ko, Lord?” he lamented. Because of this, Caguioa had no other choice but to contact his closest friends, including some fellow faculty members. Feeling hopeless, Caguioa did not waste time in finding a place where his condition will be immediately attended to. Fortunately, his family roots had granted him a contact in his local barangay in Valenzuela, which assured his spot in a Covid-19 facility. Upon his stay in the facility, he was again battling with another enemy 一 being apart from his family for days more than the expected average 14-day Covid-19 infection. “The worst feeling is ‘yung hindi ako makabalik sa bahay for the longest time. Kasi to be honest with you, I went positive for 49 days,” Caguioa shared. When asked how Covid-19 negatively impacted him, he said it was the lost time being with his children. In fact, he also shared that his experience was agonizing because he could not see his children. He had set a wireless CCTV just to see and talk to his children while he was in the facility. “I even cried kasi, siyempre, we celebrate ‘yung monthly celebration ng baby namin. Even my birthday kasi I had my birthday on August 16, and I was still quarantined. Talagang wala, wala man lang celebration. Ako lang mag-isa rito. So, ayun talaga, sadness, loneliness, being away from my children and family,” he added. On the other hand, Caguioa stated that despite all the difficulties, his experience made him closer to God. In fact, during his stay in the facility, his companions constantly asked if he was a priest because he frequently prayed and wore a big rosary on his neck. He was taking the time in returning to his old self — specifically the time when he almost entered the seminary during his high school days. In addition, he said that one should be competent enough when caught in such a nightmare because there are seemingly endless challenges. “Kasi ang number one na nakalaban ko inside the facility is not the sickness itself; it’s all here in the mind. Actually, umabot na nang almost one month na mentally challenged ako. I almost went to depression, pero feel ko umabot na ako roon eh. Kasi hindi ko na alam ang gagawin ko,” stated Caguioa. Despite this, he remained steadfast because of the warriors that were praying for him, and he still has a mission to illuminate the terrains of his students. No doubt, Caguioa is a strong man for he was able to overcome a nightmare as murky as contracting the deadly Covid-19. “Have a stronger faith. Believe in the Lord. Siguro, mas mabigat lang ‘yung krus na pinabuhat sa atin, pero in the long run, baka may mas malaking nilalaan si Lord para sa atin. Kaya kailangan pagdaanan muna natin ‘to. I went through a bigger cross, so I can enjoy a bigger salvation,” he answered when asked what message would we like to impart to other Thomasians who are in the same situation as he were. Even heroes who are expected to save the people from all the dangers that the dark hours entail were not exempted from the nightmare Covid-19 has brought. Another Thomasian who was once immersed in this dark dream is Carmina Fuentebella. As a resident doctor in UST, Fuentebella had found herself in a hospital bed, living the nightmare brought by the pandemic. In fact, she even spent her 27th birthday facing the disease but on the receiving end of the care she used to give to her patients. “Sa una talaga, since marami naman akong na-handle na sakit and relatively bata lang kasi ako, hindi ako takot na nagka-Covid ako. ‘Yung mga kabarkada ko or mga co-residents ko, nagkaroon sila pero naka-admit lang sila tapos eventually gumaling din naman sila so nakauwi rin sila na walang problems. So, hindi talaga ako natatakot nung time na ‘yun,” said Fuentebella in an interview with The Aquinian. However, these thoughts were broken down as she laid in her hospital bed, severely suffering from the disease. As a person in a medical field, what she experienced in the span of time that she was in the hospital was beyond what she had ever expected. She couldn’t help but to find herself vulnerable, given that she was once the hero to people like her. It was easy for her to feel helpless by the thought that she was facing this nightmare alone. “Nung na-admit ako, dun ko na-feel na nagde-deteriorate ako nang konti. Nahihirapan ako huminga, tapos ‘yun nga na-intubate ako,” Fuentebella shared. Aside from the pain that she was experiencing, what stood out as the most painful experience was being separated from her family — the very own people who supported and gave her the opportunity to become a medical practitioner. With all these hardships, she found it inevitable to find herself miserable in the middle of the road. “Kasi ang mahirap kasi sa Covid is dealing with isolation. Kasi ikaw lang talaga lalaban mag-isa. Mag-isa ka sa room. May times na hindi ka talaga, wala ka talagang mapuntahan. Ikaw lang. Nakadepende ka kasi sa sarili mo, dun sa chat, and sa lakas ng loob mo na sana ma-overcome mo siya. Mahirap kasi sabihin na ‘kaya mo ‘yan’ kasi nung time talaga na ‘yun, point of giving up ako,” said Fuentebella. Confusion and pain were predominant during the span of staying in the hospital, given that it is inevitable when you are the one isolating because of the disease. With Covid-19, the actual enemy of patients is not only the virus, but also the psychological damage it brings to the patients. The virus lived in her mind, and she could not stop the thoughts about her occupation that kept on eating her alive. “Natakot ako nung una na parang sabi ko ayoko nang magdoktor, kasi honestly naman, as residents hindi ka naman ganun kalaking kumikita compared sa mga, pag nag-consultants na eh. Mapapaisip ka kung is it really worth it na kapag doktor ka, tas ‘pag nagkasakit ka uli, namatay ka, mawawala lahat ng mga dreams mo in the future, yung mga gusto mo pang gawin,” she added. Indeed, Covid-19 caused these individuals to shiver and almost succumb to the cold and detestable night. As they awakened from the darkest of dreams, they may still be recovering, but the strength in their hearts are stronger than ever.

Comelec spokesman James Jimenez said on Wednesday the poll body was considering temporarily prohibiting  the traditional “face-to-face” campaign in the wake of uncertainties on the start of the implementation of the country’s vaccination program. The poll body, Jimenez added, has sounded the alarm to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) to discuss the matter. Jimenez said, however, that any changes in the method of campaigning on radio and television would also need a corresponding amendment on related existing elections laws. The start of the campaign period is determined by the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), which is 90 and 45 days for national and local candidates respectively.The OEC also limits campaign spending of candidates. On the other hand, Republic Act (RA) 9006 or the Fair Elections Act regulates the size of printed campaign materials and limits television and radio advertisements. The Comelec noted that with some 80 million Filipinos who need to be vaccinated, the implementation of the vaccination program could last up to 2024. Jimenez said that in the absence of a herd immunity, it would be in the best interest of  all concerned to temporarily ban face-to-face campaigns to control the spread of Covid-19. During the 2019 polls, the Comelec, for the first time in the country’s political history, monitored the social media expenses of candidates and political parties.",Manila Times

A WHO investigative team is in Wuhan, China — where the first cases were discovered in December 2019 — trying to piece together how the virus jumped from animals to humans before going on to kill more than two million people. The UN agency’s emergencies director Michael Ryan hit out at those sniping at the mission, and said people claiming they have information on how the pandemic broke out should emerge from the shadows. Ryan said many critics were saying they “won’t accept the report when it comes out”, or that there is “other intelligence available that may show different findings” on how the virus broke out. “If you have the answers… please let us know,” Ryan told a press conference from the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva. He asked how responsible it was “to say you won’t accept a report before it’s even written? To say that you have intelligence that has not been provided?” The WHO mission comes with heavy political baggage — China refused the team access until mid-January and there are question marks over what the experts can hope to find, one year on. Beijing is keen to put the focus on its recovery from the outbreak. The team toured a propaganda exhibition celebrating China’s recovery from the pandemic in Wuhan on Saturday. Ryan was responding to a question which referenced new US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who earlier Monday told NBC that China was falling “far short of the mark.” “China has to step up and make sure that it is being transparent, that it is providing information and sharing information, that it is giving access to international experts and inspectors,” Blinken said. “Its failure to do that is a real problem.” Ryan said the team in the field deserved international support, and in the meantime, “it’s time for people who say and think they have information to start providing it”. He added that all infectious disease investigations find information that then throws up further questions. “It’s a detective story,” he said. Peter Daszak (r), Vladimir G. Dedkov( l) and other members of the World Health Organization  team investigating the origins of the Covid-19 leave the Hubei Center for animal disease control and prevention in Wuhan, China’s central Hubei province on February 2, 2021. AFP PHOTO The expert team in Wuhan has now started investigations on the ground, notably visiting the Huanan seafood market where one of the first reported clusters of infections emerged, and the hospital where early patients were treated. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said the team would be visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Former US president Donald Trump pushed an unsubstantiated theory that the virus escaped from the facility. The team are having “very productive discussions with Chinese counterparts, visiting different hospitals around Wuhan,” Van Kerkhove said. “They had a very good visit to the market, seeing first-hand the stalls and walking through.” Van Kerkhove said they had also met with counterparts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “They will visit the Institute of Virology. That is being planned,” she added. Meanwhile WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was “encouraging” that the global number of new coronavirus cases had fallen for the third week in a row. “It shows this virus can be controlled, even with the new variants in circulation,” he said. However, “we have been here before,” he warned. “Over the past year, there have been moments in almost all countries when cases declined, and governments opened up too quickly and individuals let down their guard, only for the virus to come roaring back.”",Manila Times

Valente, TMT",2021-02-02,"‘Just keep faith with us,’ Duterte on corruption allegations vs govt","PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has urged the public to keep their faith in his administration amid allegations of corruption in the government, particularly in the procurement of vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). In his weekly public address aired over state-run PTV-4 on Monday evening, Duterte guaranteed that there were enough funds to pay for Covid-19 vaccines as he dismissed criticisms over the government’s rollout. He said the country’s “greatest disadvantage” was that it was not as rich as Western countries that have already pre-ordered 80 percent of the global vaccine supply, but assured that doses were forthcoming because “we have funds to pay for the vaccines”. He cited that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have offered loans to pay for the vaccines that the government will buy. The government’s efforts to procure Covid-19 vaccines were once questioned due to the non-disclosure of actual prices of the vaccine. In Monday’s remarks, Duterte slammed critics claiming corruption in the government’s Covid-19 vaccine procurement anew, urging Filipinos not to believe in their false accusations. “Ang hingiin ko lang sana, patapusin mo lang ninyo lang kami (All I ask of you is for you to let us do our jobs first). If there is a liability in one, there will be a liability in all,” the President said. He told the public not to be “gullible” as to believe “talk about corruption left and right”. “It starts with a big bang and ends with a whimper. Wala naman napakulong ‘yang mga ‘yan (They have not sent anybody to prison),” he added. The President also promised to prove that vaccine procurement and rollout would be done “in accordance with the rule of law.” “I said, you have a choice, maniwala kayo sa kanila o maniwala kayo sa amin. Kung maniwala kayo sa kanila, go ahead (You can believe us or not. If you believe them, go ahead),” Duterte said. “Kung may maiwan na maniwala sa amin (If there will be those who will remain),  just keep faith with us. At the end of the day, you will see that everything has been done in accordance with the rule of law,” he added. The President likewise asked the public to trust that the country’s vaccine czar, Carlito Galvez Jr., would get vaccines for the Philippines. “Just stick with General Galvez. Huwag na kayong — huwag kayong lumipas sa kanya (Don’t overlook him) or ignore him and believe the others,” he said. Duterte also said that vaccine deals would not be final until it has been reviewed by Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd. On Monday, Galvez said the country has secured 106 to 108 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines after he signed five term sheets with manufacturers. READ: PH close to securing 188M doses of Covid-19 vaccines The Philippines hopes to secure some 148 million doses, aside from the 40 million doses that will come from the World Health Organization-led Covax Facility, to inoculate an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos this year.

According to the poll conducted from November 21 to 25 among 1,500 respondents nationwide, SWS recorded the highest average unemployment rate since it started analyzing these figures, currently sitting at 37.4 percent. The average joblessness rate for 2020 was a 8.6-percentage point increase from the previous record of 28.8 percent in 2012 and the 19.8 percent recorded in 2019, or before the pandemic hit the country. In the latest SWS survey, joblessness was at 27.3 percent of the adult labor force, down by 12 points from the 39.5 percent in September 2020. “The estimated numbers of jobless adults are 12.7 million in November 2020 and 23.7 million in September 2020,” SWS said. “Joblessness was 17.5 percent in December 2019, the last measurement before the Covid-19 crisis began,” the polling firm added. SWS defines labor force as those 18 years and above and presently with a job, including those looking for a job. Adults who are jobless consists of those who voluntarily left their old jobs, are seeking jobs for the first time, or lost their jobs due to economic circumstances beyond their control. SWS estimated 12.7 million jobless adult Filipinos in November 2020, lower than the 23.7 million in September 2020. “The 12-point decline in the national joblessness rate was due to decreases of 33 points in the Visayas, 23 points in Mindanao, two points in Metro Manila, and one point in Balance Luzon,” SWS said. Adult joblessness fell sharply in the Visayas, from a record-high 52.0 percent in September 2020 to 19.1 percent in November 2020. It fell sharply in Mindanao, from 40.0 percent in September 2020 to 17.0 percent in November 2020. Adult joblessness fell slightly in Balance Luzon, from 33.5 percent in September 2020 to 32.7 percent in November 2020. It also fell slightly in Metro Manila, from 39.9 percent in September 2020 to 37.8 percent in November 2020.

Gonzales,2021-02-02,GOCCs’ P119-B dividends allocated for Covid efforts,"The Department of Finance (DoF) said a total of P119.1 billion or bulk of the P157-billion cash dividends remitted by government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) in 2020 partly funded the Social Amelioration Program (SAP) to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic on poorest households and vulnerable sectors. In a statement, the DoF’s Corporate Affairs Group (CAG) said the P156.97 billion in dividends remitted last year by 57 GOCCs to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) was the highest amount ever collected since the implementation of Republic Act (RA) 7656 or the “Dividends Law of 1994.” “This is also more than twice of the P69.17 billion dividend collection in 2019, inclusive of the dividend foregone. Without dividends foregone, cash remittances is P135.08 billion in 2020 and P52.59 billion in 2019,” the CAG headed by Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko said in a report to Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd. Tionko said that P119.1 billion of the GOCCs’ dividend remittances contributed to the government’s unprogrammed revenues. “These GOCC dividends were primarily utilized  for the Social Amelioration Program, which provided emergency assistance to low-income families to help tide them over during the strict lockdowns imposed earlier last year to curb the spread of Covid-19,” Tionko said. This year, Tionko said the CAG will continue to make sure that GOCCs will comply with ra 7856 and its implementing rules and regulations. She said the CAG was able to secure an agreement with the Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG) in 2020 for the transfer of the web-based GOCC Debt Recording and Monitoring System (GDRAMS) to the DoF. This reporting system aims to streamline the data reporting process and facilitate the timely encoding and submission of the GOCCs of their debt reports, Tionko said. “GDRAMS will help in the analysis of GOCC debt and better manage the government’s financial exposure and strategy formulation,” Tionko said. She said the DoF will further enhance the GDRAMS and train GOCCs on the use of the system so it could be fully implemented this year.",Manila Times

Dressed in a suit, tie and overcoat — but without a face mask — he is seen walking and talking for around 13 minutes through the National Palace. Lopez Obrador said he was working while in isolation, in particular on efforts to secure more vaccines for Mexico, which has one of the world’s highest Covid-19 death tolls at more than 156,000. The country began a mass immunization program on December 24 but like many nations it is struggling to acquire enough doses. Lopez Obrador said Mexico expected to receive six million doses from various manufacturers in February and 12 million in March, by when it hopes to have given a first shot to all older adults. The left-wing populist, who has a history of heart problems and hypertension, announced Sunday that he was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 but had mild symptoms. He joins other world leaders who have caught the virus, including former US president Donald Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron. The health ministry reported on Wednesday that Lopez Obrador had experienced brief episodes of low-grade fever and a slight headache. The Mexican leader has refused to wear a mask except on rare occasions during the pandemic. He was accused by critics of downplaying the risks of the virus early in the crisis and of being slow to impose a lockdown.

Ibarreta also recalled how they sealed partnership with Philippine Airlines that entailed them having a hospitality desk at the Terminal 2 of Philippine Airlines. “We were there to volunteer, we provided snacks, coffee to the arriving OFWs and balikbayans.

Two of them stood out, aligned rules and regulations for tourists and subsidized swab testing. Champion of Resilience Individual, Elena CecilleDaugdaug of Quest Cebu “The Department of Tourism is pushing the local government units to have a same requirements when it comes to rules and regulations. They should have an alignment meeting because they have different requirements per city,” Rose Libongco, HSMA co-founder and Virtus Awards Chair said. Ibarreta, meanwhile, suggested, “We have to thank Tourism Promotions Board COO Anthonette Velasco-Allones and Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat because I think they’ve subsidized swab testing. For the special rate, it is now only for P1,500. But it will be a boost if tourist won’t have to pay for swab testing anymore.” Virtus Awards 2020 Looking at the bright side, the event also saw the annual Virtus Awards. Indeed, HSMA still found a way to recognize the most creative, productive and proactive hotel sales and marketing professionals who were more than resilient in the face of a pandemic.

They should have an alignment meeting because they have different requirements per city,” Rose Libongco, HSMA co-founder and Virtus Awards Chair said. Ibarreta, meanwhile, suggested, “We have to thank Tourism Promotions Board COO Anthonette Velasco-Allones and Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat because I think they’ve subsidized swab testing. For the special rate, it is now only for P1,500. But it will be a boost if tourist won’t have to pay for swab testing anymore.” Virtus Awards 2020 Looking at the bright side, the event also saw the annual Virtus Awards. Indeed, HSMA still found a way to recognize the most creative, productive and proactive hotel sales and marketing professionals who were more than resilient in the face of a pandemic. Outstanding Sales and Marketing Leaders winner EunJoo Bae, Director of Sales-FIT at Conrad Manila The highlight of the prestigious event was the Champions of Resilience Awards, created to recognize the contributions of individuals and institutional team/s in addressing the challenges of the pandemic. The Champions of Resilience Awards are divided into three categories: Individual – which was won by Ma. Elena Cecille Daugdaug, Sales Manager of Quest Hotel and Conference Center Cebu; Team – won by Luxent Hotel under the leadership of Melanie Pagkalinawan, General Manager; and Marketing Communications – won by Chroma Hospitality, as led by Carmela Bocanegra, Vice President for Sales and Marketing. As in previous Virtus Awards, honors were given to the Outstanding Sales and Marketing Associate, which was conferred to Erika Denice Patajo, Events Executive of Okada Manila; and Outstanding Sales and Marketing Manager for Pio Sanchez, Senior Sales Manager of El Nido Resorts. Meanwhile, Outstanding Sales and Marketing Leaders was given to Eun Joo Bae, Director of Sales-FIT at Conrad Manila; and, finally, Outstanding Marketing Campaign, an accolade taken home by Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila, represented by Dave Pimentel, Director of Marketing and Communications, Margot and for their “Bid to Forever” campaign.",Manila Times

The program holds true to its commitment of bringing optimum nutrition for Filipinos. The department came up with new set of strategic plans that will guide planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the institute’s performance through various programs and projects. The goal is to be at the forefront of food and nutrition researches, innovative technologies and transformative information toward a well-nourished nation. The strategies are designed to synergize and complement each other to achieve the strategic direction in five years. Updated nutrition tools
One of the immediate responses to this five-year strategic plan is the launching of the updated nutrition tools on February 19, 2020. These nutrition tools include the Philippine Food Composition Tables 2019 and the Food Exchange Lists (FEL) for Meal Planning, 4th edition. The development of these nutrition tools is aimed at improving the quality of life of Filipinos. On the same event, the DoST-FNRI also launched nutritious food products for nutritionally at-risk Filipinos. The new food products include the Enhanced Micronutrient Growth Mix (MGM 15), Multi-Nutrient Extruded Rice Kernel (MNERK), Rice-Mongo Blend with Vegetables, Rice-Mongo Curls with Vegetable and Extruded Sweet Potato Fries. The new nutritious food products were adopted for commercialization by the Nutridense Food Manufacturing Corporation of Santa Barbara, Pangasinan, which already markets several FNRI food technologies. Quick responses and studies vs Covid-19
After the announcement of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, one of the immediate responses of DoST-FNRI is to lend one unit of Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) machine to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on April 16, 2020 to aid in the testing for Covid-19. The department also steps up response to the pandemic by linking with other government agencies in evaluating the beneficial effects of the virgin coconut oil (VCO) among suspect and probable cases of Covid-19. The DoST-FNRI, as project lead, has collaborated with DoST-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD), DoST-Regional Office IV-Calabarzon, Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) and the local government of Sta. Rosa City, Laguna in conducting this study. On Jan. 28, 2021, DoST-FNRI reported the results of the study on virgin coconut oil (VCO) as dietary supplement among Covid-19 probable and suspect cases. It showed that five of the 29 patients who were served meals with VCO manifested diminishing signs and symptoms as early as the second day, while only one patient served with the same meals, but without VCO showed similar improvement. The study was called “Seeing Beyond Covid-19: The VCO Study – Effects of Virgin Coconut Oil among Suspect and Probable Cases” on December 3, 2020. The VCO Group of patients who were served meals with VCO showed no Covid-19 related symptoms at Day 18, while symptoms persisted in some patients of the Control Group of patients who were served the same meals without VCO until Day 23, DoST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña further stated. Secretary dela Peña added that VCO could be used as an adjunct supplement to probable and suspect Covid-19 cases to help prevent symptoms from becoming severe. However, more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of VCO as adjunct therapy for Covid-19 patients with other co-morbidities, Secretary dela Peña clarified. Return of nutribun
On July, 29, 2020, the deparment conducted the first ever online soft launching of “Ang Pagbabalik ng Nutribun,” via Zoom. The Enhanced Nutribun has more micronutrients like iron and vitamin A. The texture is softer and weighs 160- 165 grams per piece, which is easier for children to hold and bite. Each serving of Enhanced Nutribun weighing 160-165 grams per piece, has 504 calories, 17.8 grams protein, 6.08 milligrams iron and 244 micrograms vitamin A. The Enhanced Nutribun is one of the DoST-FNRI’s answers to the call of the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD) Memorandum Circular No. 12 Series of 2020, or the Guidelines in the Implementation of the Supplementary Feeding Program During Community Quarantine or Other Similar Emergencies. Dr. Mario Capanzana, DoST-FNRI director, encouraged existing and prospective partners to once again support this noble initiative to help ease the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis on the nutritional well-being of our future generation. In his message of support, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Alexei Nograles underscored that: “According to the 2018 Fill the Nutrient Gap – Philippine Summary Report of the World Food Programme, 1/3 of Philippine households are not able to afford a diet that meets the nutritional needs.” Cab. Sec. Nograles also said that “With the Covid-19 pandemic, it has made things even more complicated. And with all these challenges brought about by Covid-19, the government must do all that we can by stretching our limited resources. With these challenges, we need to turn to maximizing science and technology to fill these nutrient gaps and better provide Filipino children with a healthy food that they need to survive and to thrive. “The Nutribun is an example of a science-driven solution that government is pursuing to address hunger and malnutrition. The Enhanced Nutribun developed by DOSTFNRI is more delicious, more nutritious, has better texture, made mainly from squash for better taste, and enriched with protein, iron and vitamin A among others,” Nograles further declared. Current nutritional status
The percentage of food insecure households increased significantly from 53.9 percent in 2018 to 64.1 percent in 2019, according to the 2019 Expanded National Nutrition Survey (ENNS), recent study of DoST-FNRI. The DoST-FNRI further reported that food insecure households were higher in rural areas, with male-headed households, poor or lower wealth status, lower educational attainment of household head, those engaged in agriculture and those with no financial assistance from family members working abroad. Overall, there was a slight improvement in the nutritional status among Filipinos in 2019, with a decreasing trend of stunting among children, although not statistically significant, as well as decreasing trend of overweight and obesity across all age groups. There was also an improvement in anemia prevalence with a decrease in prevalence from 2018 to 2019 across all age groups. However, household food insecurity remains high. Likewise, the increasing trend of diabetes among adults and no significant change in lifestyle-related risk factors still need to be addressed. With the worsening Covid-19 pandemic in the country and in the whole world, there is fear that these improvements might revert back. Challenge amid pandemic
Thus, the challenge for policymakers and program implementers is to mitigate hunger and malnutrition amid the pandemic by keeping food supply available and accessible to all households. Other urgent interventions must include promoting sustained breastfeeding among infants, providing appropriate complementary and supplementary food among preschool and school-age children, and reducing lifestyle related risk factors among adolescents, adults and elderly.

The World Health Organization’s Especial Envoy on Covid-19 David Nabarro, says people should expect to see more coronavirus mutations, but at present there is no evidence to suggest vaccinations will become ineffective. He said, “I think we are going to see more variants coming along and we are going to have to be very clever in understanding quickly what these variants mean when it comes to the preventive therapies, particularly vaccination.” Because of these developments, one’s defenses should level up. Below are some of the tips to remain healthy. Minimize physical contact
Stay at home unless you are a frontliner like healthcare worker, uniformed personnel or media worker. Wear mask and face shield when one needs to go out to buy food and necessities. Be sure to follow social distancing guidelines. After returning home, wash hands for 20 seconds, especially after touching surfaces then take a bath immediately. Boost immune system
The second layer of defense is the immune system. According to experts, eating different fruits and vegetables with different colors can boost our immune system. Vitamin A, B12, B9, Vitamin C and D, as well as zinc and minerals enhance the immune system. Fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin A include sweet potatoes, kalabasa, broccoli, carrots, kale, letsugas and pechay. Vitamin D, also known as “vitamin for life” can be achieved from sunbathing under the early morning sun between 8 to 10 a.m. plus eating mushrooms and fish. Red fruits and vegetables are good anti-inflammatory food while orange veggies and fruits are anti-bacterial. Green ones are good for blood vessels like controlling high-blood pressure. Meanwhile, purple ones are good not just for immune system but optimize brain health. Avoid eating processed food and remember food is medicine. Hydrate
Drink lots of water to avoid dehydration. Infuse water with some fruits too. Have a good night sleep. Have an average seven or eight hours of sleep. That’s a reward because it helps in boosting immune system and reduce chances of getting sick. Exercise
Organize a Zumba exercise or yoga or have 15 to 30 minutes of active exercise every day. Stay positive
Yes, it’s still pandemic but worrying will not change the present situation. Stress is a factor that can lower the immune system. So let go of things we cannot change and look at a different perspective. Be positive and influence others to do the same. And most of all, pray to God who is the great healer.",Manila Times

ONE-SHOT DEAL This September 2020 photo provided by Johnson & Johnson shows a clinician preparing to administer investigational Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Johnson & Johnson’s long-awaited Covid-19 vaccine appears to protect against symptomatic illness with just one shot – not as strong as some two-shot rivals but still potentially helpful for a world in dire need of more doses. Johnson & Johnson said on Jan. 29, 2021 that in the US and seven other countries, the first single-shot vaccine appears 66 percent effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19. It was more protective against severe symptoms at 85 percent. AP J&J said Friday that in the US and seven other countries, the single-shot vaccine was 66 percent effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness, and much more protective — 85 percent — against the most serious symptoms. There was some geographic variation. The vaccine worked better in the US — 72 percent effective against moderate to severe Covid-19 – compared to 57 percent in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus. “Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile,” Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press. With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts had been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters. But with some other competing vaccines shown to be 95 percent effective after two doses, the question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff to get more shots in arms quickly. The company said within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the US, and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the US by June, and expects to have some ready to ship as soon as authorities give the green light. These are preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn’t completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination – about the time when, if participants were getting a two-dose variety instead, they would have needed another shot. After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died regardless of whether they were exposed to “regular Covid or these particularly nasty variants,” Mammen said. When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness. Defeating the scourge that has killed more than 2 million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots being rolled out in different countries so far all require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95 percent protective after the second dose. But amid shortages, some countries have advised delaying the second dose of certain vaccines with little data on how that would affect protection. All Covid-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spikey protein that coats it. But they’re made in very different ways. J&J’s shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along. Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and to use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna. It’s not clear exactly how well the AstraZeneca version, being used in Britain and several other countries, works. Tests in Britain, South Africa and Brazil suggested two doses are about 70 percent effective although there are questions about how much protection older adults get. An ongoing US study may provide more information. J&J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40 percent had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe Covid-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV. J&J said the vaccine is safe, with reactions similar to other Covid-19 shots such as fever that occur when the immune system is revved up. While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other Covid-19 vaccines trigger such reactions, which can be reversed if promptly treated – and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used. J&J had hedged its bets with a study of a two-dose version of its vaccine which is still underway. Friday’s interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89 percent effective in a UK study and that it also seems to work — though not as well — against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the US and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers.",Manila Times

119,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/01/28/campus-press/catching-fire/833758/,"Ernie Cecilia, DPM",2021-01-28,Catching FIRe,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIRe), also referred to as Industry 4.0, is creeping into the workplace almost unnoticed. Unbeknownst to many Filipinos, some countries are now adapting to FIRe, and changing their processes to pave the way for the use of massive automation, big data analytics and the Internet of Things. They are also training their workforce to cope with the changing workplace. These countries are now “Catching FIRe”, in a positive way. The countries that ignore the handwriting on the wall about the FIRe will get burned. Covid-19 and jobs Preparation for FIRe seemed to have been sidelined by poorer economies, as Covid-19 took center stage. Some countries were so overwhelmed by the Covid-19 pandemic that they might have never seen FIRe as an emerging constraint. After the longest and harshest Covid-19 lockdown, many Filipinos have realized that work is no longer what it used to be. Work used to be a place you commute to everyday, where you punch your timecard before and after your work schedule, and where you join hundreds or thousands of other employees to produce products or services for specific customers. These days, work is what you do wherever you are, for whoever wants your product or service. Many people think that Covid-19 redefined the concept of work. In reality, it did not. Before the pandemic, many of the changes that we see today in the Philippines were already being done in other countries. As early as five years ago, Americans and Europeans would call a phone number and give the attendant a list of things they want to buy from a grocery store or restaurant and get their groceries or food without having to go out. The Covid-19 pandemic is not a change driver. Technology has driven the major changes in business models and business processes today. The two other major change drivers are 1) the deluge of information that influence government and business leaders in making decisions, and 2) the people themselves — customers who demand more, employees who are more empowered, and citizens who can no longer tolerate the slow undoing of their rights as stakeholders in governance and business. The Covid-19 pandemic is a change accelerator — not a change driver. Pre-Covid, countries already encouraged employees to work from home. Covid-19 practically made work from home (WFH) the default position. Online meetings, webinars, and even online learning in schools and training institutions replaced face-to-face meetings. But the most debilitating effect of the pandemic is the massive closure of hundreds of thousands of Filipino establishments, especially among the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). As a consequence, millions of Filipinos have lost their jobs. Filipinos wish that the situation would normalize, so that they can get back their jobs. But experts are saying that because of FIRe, some jobs will never be the same. Post-Covid jobs The Financial Times reported, “Industry executives say that the process of technological change is accelerating as a result of the coronavirus. The new innovations include … chatbots, some of which use the same voice recognition technology behind Amazon’s Alexa, and software that can replace repetitive tasks done by humans.” A study of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revealed that “32 of its member countries noted that the rise of automation and other forms of very advanced technology puts at risk an alarming number of jobs and industries (Nedelkoska & Quintini, 2018). It found that 14 percent of all jobs among OECD countries, equivalent to 66 million workers across 32 countries, have high chances of being automated (at 70% chance of automation). Meanwhile, an additional 32 percent of jobs have a 50- to 70-percent chance of automation, meaning that a significant amount of the tasks involved in those jobs could be automated.” Considering the massive impact of Covid-19 on businesses and jobs, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a recent 2020 Future of Jobs report. Here are some of the findings: – Before the pandemic, it was opined that the FIRe would render some jobs obsolete, and new jobs will be created. As a consequence of Covid-19, creation of new jobs will not come automatically as a matter of course. – “For those workers set to remain in their roles, the share of core skills that will change in the next five years is 40%, and 50% of all employees will need reskilling.” ¬– The pandemic accelerated the digital transformation of many organizations. The Future of Work for white collar jobs have started, as firms adopted remote working or WFH. – “Roughly 66% of employers surveyed expect to get a return on investment in upskilling and reskilling within one year.” Only 21% of companies surveyed get government support. Upskilling and reskilling To adapt to changes brought about by FIRe, “upskilling and reskilling” of the workforce is highly recommended. Upskilling will help workers cope with changing demands of their current roles. Reskilling will prepare them to qualify for other or newer jobs. According to a 2018 McKinsey study, these job categories will experience a radical shift in skills needs: 1) physical and manual (motor skill-based jobs); 2) basic cognitive (requiring numeracy and literacy); 3) higher cognitive (advanced literacy, decision making, complex information processing, and creativity); 4) social and emotional skills (entrepreneurial, extensive interpersonal and communication skills, and teaching); and 5) technological skills (science-based and higher-level IT skills). McKinsey recognizes the need for physical and manual skills in the future but suggested that workers in this category must have a certain level of digital skills. In the December 1-3, 2020 Arangkada forum of the Joint Foreign Chambers of the Philippines (JFC), Kaushik Das, senior partner and managing partner of Southeast Asia McKinsey & Co., estimated that 19.3 million Filipino employees will likely be displaced in the next few years due to the effects of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics, unless government seriously implements “reskilling and upskilling for new technologies.” Hard and soft skills Hard skills are capabilities required to perform jobs in one’s area of specialization. They are often referred to as technical or technological skills. These skills are vulnerable to technological changes. Soft skills are as important as hard skills. These skills are more “general” and needed across a wide array of job categories. Soft skills are also referred to as “transversal” skills, or skills that can be improved through lifelong learning. In the 1980s, several gurus have identified the 21st century soft skills needed for career success — critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity/innovation. Ben Marr of Forbes (2019) identified the soft skills required during the FIRe regime. He cited the 21st century skills and added a few more — emotional intelligence (EQ), analytical ability, decision-making, interpersonal skills, and quick adaptiveness. Dr. Marion Steel of Deakin University emphasized that harnessing soft skills helps keep work “human centric”, as we prepare to work with machines and artificial intelligence. “Leadership” is an important skill of a manager of the future, as the manager needs to effectively work with both people and “thinking machines” that report to him. It is not far-fetched that the rank and file will be supervised by a “robo-boss” that reports to a human manager. Cross-sectoral digital skills will be needed to allow people to traverse careers, for instance, from information technology to information management, to artificial intelligence. The immensity of the change that FIRe could bring will need serious preparation. Organizations must plan to upskill and reskill their people. Governments must help the upskilling and reskilling of displaced employees. When the smoke clears, and the workplace is more Covid-free, many employees will be surprised to find that their old jobs no longer exist. They must possess new skills sets to qualify for jobs in the next normal. There is still no substitute for preparedness, although serendipity and luck can help.

Officials now expect the first batch of Pfizer jabs, which will consist of 117,000 doses, to arrive within the second quarter.Related StoriesPhilippines signs indemnity agreement with COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers""We have done everything that we have to do. We have signed all the documents that were given to us. It's just a matter of waiting for Pfizer to deliver the vaccine. Let's just wait,"" Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told radio station dzBB.Nograles, also the co-chairman of the government's pandemic task force, said the administration is negotiating with different parties for the vaccine procurement given the supply limitations. He noted that the government has also secured vaccines manufactured by Chinese drug maker Sinovac and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. The government will also negotiate with the Serum Institute of India for the procurement of Novavax jabs and additional AstraZeneca shots.""What is good about our vaccine roll-out plan is we are not dependent on just one brand. We understood early on that there are supply concerns worldwide,"" Nograles said.""We are not just dependent on western countries. We are also looking at Asian countries,"" he added.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. previously said the bulk of Pfizer vaccines may not arrive in the Philippines anytime soon because of high demand.Nograles thanked Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez for his efforts to secure vaccines, noting that Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have committed to allocate supplies to the Philippines.""These two brands are included in the seven brands we are looking at. More brands may be added...We have a good mix because we have western and Asian brands. As the whole world is scrambling for supplies, we have talked to some parties,"" the Cabinet secretary said in Filipino.  A total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac jabs and 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca shots were turned over to the Philippines last week. Another 38,400 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines that were acquired through the COVAX facility were expected to arrive last night.Nograles assured the public that the vaccine priority list would be followed during the roll-out of the AstraZeneca shots. He said the inclusion of non-medical personnel during the start of the vaccination program, including some high-ranking officials, was just a ""miscommunication.""We're really sticking to the priority list. We have a good set-up and we have the NITAG (National Immunization Technical Advisory Group)... and they recommend to the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases) who should be prioritized. Whatever the NITAG recommends, we stick to it,"" he said.""I don't want to preempt the results of the investigation but like I said before... based on the preliminary assessment, it seems that there was a (miscommunication) but there was no intention to jump the line but we're sticking to that queue,"" he added.Under the government's priority list, medical frontliners should be the first to be immunized, followed by senior citizens, frontline personnel in essential sectors, indigent population, other government workers, other essential workers, socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigenous people, overseas Filipino workers, other remaining work force, and the rest of the Filipino population.",Philstar

It was approved for emergency use by US regulators in late 2020 and was the jab that America's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci received in December of last year.Apart from the agreed 13 million doses, officials said a separate deal for another 7 million is also anticipated, bringing the total allocation to 20 million as said by Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez Saturday.The development marks a crucial step in the country's vaccination efforts and in turn, on government's bid to inoculate 50 to 70 million this year alone.A supply deal, however, is still different from a purchase agreement. Last month, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said government has signed supply deals with five manufacturers that he did not name.But nothing on procurement has been made final to date, and the jabs that the Philippines have received so far are donations such as Beijing's Sinovac and the Astrazeneca doses from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility.",Philstar

But it potentially also is a moment where we lose concentration,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference.“I really am very concerned that... we think we’re through this. We’re not.“And countries are going to lurch back into third and fourth surges if we’re not careful.“We should not waste the hope that vaccines bring... by dropping our guard in other areas.”WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the first full week of the COVAX roll-out, but said wealthy countries were nonetheless still leaving others behind in the vaccination rush.Within Africa, Angola, the DR Congo, The Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan and Uganda have now received their first doses through COVAX.Elsewhere, Cambodia, Colombia, India, Moldova, the Philippines and South Korea have also taken deliveries.“In the next week, COVAX will deliver 14.4 million doses to a further 31 countries. That brings the total number of countries to 51,” said Tedros.“This is encouraging progress, but the volume of doses being distributed through COVAX is still relatively small.”He said the first round of allocations, running until the end of May, only covered between two and three percent of the population in recipient states, “even as other countries make rapid progress towards vaccinating their entire population within the next few months.”He called for vaccine production to be urgently ramped up, including through linking manufacturers with rival companies that have spare capacity.Tedros also said the planet would be feeling the mental scars from the pandemic for years to come and said the scale of its impact would be worse than during the recovery from World War II.“The whole world is affected. Each and every individual. That means mass trauma which is beyond proportion. Even bigger than what the world experienced after the Second World War,” he said.“And when there is mass trauma it affects communities for many years to come. Countries have to see it as such and prepare for that. Mass, mass trauma.”Brazil fearsMeanwhile Tedros voiced alarm about the coronavirus situation in Brazil, where cases and deaths have shot up, bucking the global trend.He said that in the week beginning Nov. 2, there were 114,000 new cases in Brazil – a figure that hit 374,000 in the week of Feb. 22.Tedros said the number of deaths had also shot up from 2,500 to 8,000 over the same time period.“The situation is very serious and we’re very concerned, and the public health measures that Brazil takes should be aggressive while also rolling out vaccines,” he said. “Brazil has to take this very, very seriously.”He said that because Brazil bordered so many other countries, the situation there threatened the entire South American continent.Ryan said the P1 variant – which has now been found in 29 countries – had become dominant in Brazil, adding to its woes.He said basic public health measures were still the “best bet” in trying to control case numbers.“Our risk, to an extent, is still in our hands,” Ryan said.But he added that it was very hard in countries like Brazil with large urban populations to take measures like physical distancing and mask-wearing “where they don’t have the resources to do that without the support of the state.”",Philstar

Sinovac, the only vaccine currently being rolled out, is only recommended by the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group for people aged between 18 and 59 years.The World Health Organization stands by the use of AstraZeneca vaccine despite a preliminary study suggesting the jab offered less protection against the variant first seen in South Africa, its representative to the Philippines said Thursday.

We are going in circles. This is the only thing that will stop the cycle of COVID.”When they first made a survey on who were willing to get inoculated with CoronaVac, QCGH director Josephine Sabando said only three out of over 1,000 personnel answered in the affirmative.Most of the hospital employees were willing to wait for other vaccine brands, Sabando said.Mayor Joy Belmonte admitted that she was initially dismayed when she heard that only a handful were willing to receive the vaccine developed by Sinovac, which was granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.Belmonte lauded Sabando for convincing more medical personnel to get vaccinated with Sinovac.Sabando said 300 doses of Sinovac received by Quezon City have been allocated, with more on the waitlist.The hospital director said she organized town hall meetings where she presented data about the efficacy of Coronavac, especially for severe COVID cases.“It prevents mild cases of COVID-19 by 50.4 percent. For moderate, it is 78 percent. But for severe, it is 100 percent similar to AstraZeneca,” Sabando said.“With this vaccine, we are preventing moderate to severe cases among our healthcare workers. Once vaccinated, there will be almost complete protection from hospitalization, intubation, even death,” she added.Sabando underscored the importance of vaccinating health workers as soon as possible, citing the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila.Belmonte expressed gratitude to the frontline workers who consented to receive the China-made vaccine.“This is a milestone in our COVID-19 response. We have begun the vaccination starting with our health workers,” she said.“I want our doctors and healthcare workers to be protected in any way possible.

It is miles away from the vaccination progress in its ASEAN neighbors like Indonesia which has so far rolled out 2.69 million doses, Myanmar with 104,664 doses and Cambodia 33,211 doses.Generally, developing Asia is much behind in vaccination compared to the US and Europe. ADB principal health specialist Eduardo Banzon said a lot of factors can explain the slow progress.“There’s problem on cold chain logistics for the vaccines and this is adult vaccination. Most of the countries are used to childhood vaccination, it’s a little different now,” Banzon said.“It’s a campaign type and shifting to campaign mode for the next six months or so would be challenging. Vaccine hesitance is a problem but not a problem that cannot be solved,” he said.ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada, for his part, emphasized that vaccine rollouts – from procurement to deployment to confirmation of effectiveness – will shape every country’s reopening and recovery this year.“Vaccine roll out is very critical in deciding and reopening of each country,” Sawada said.Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Harry Roque denied insinuation by administration critics that President Duterte was setting the bar low when the latter said the country would achieve normalcy only by 2023. “Well, you know that going back to normalcy is anyone’s guess,” he said.He explained the President’s statement was logical since some experts have said that the country might attain “herd immunity” only a year after a vaccination kickoff.He said if the country completes its vaccination program this year, it will only be by 2022 that herd immunity could be established to signal a return to normalcy.Roque said the government is working doublly hard to restore the public’s faith in the vaccine and the economy.“I don’t think there is a chilling effect on consumption. Why? As the President has said a vaccination program will only have to take off and attract many people for him to decide on opening everything,” he said. – Christina Mendez",Philstar

The first thing is that he’s very happy with the rollout, with what’s happening in the rollout. He wants to see more happening as a challenge to all of us. Perhaps he wants to see a more massive rollout,” Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said.Simultaneous vaccine rollouts would be held in the Cordilleras, Ilocos, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Western Visayas and Eastern Visayas on Monday.Since Monday, Philippine Airlines has airlifted 55,200 doses of Sinovac vaccines to Cagayan de Oro, Davao, Legazpi and Cotabato on four different flights.Upon arrival, the vaccine were loaded into cold-storage vans and delivered to various hospitals in preparation for regional vaccination drives.Loosening restrictionsAnd because of the expected arrival of vaccines from both the COVAX facility and Chinese drug-maker Sinovac, Nograles added that it’s possible to place the entire country under the most lenient modified general community quarantine or MGCQ.Around 9,077 persons have received vaccines in 10 Metro Manila hospitals so far, with the government allotting 3.7 million vaccine doses solely for healthcare workers.The Armed Forces of the Philippines confirmed that 2,290 military health personnel have been inoculated in five sites during the first four days of vaccination.For the Philippine Coast Guard, commodores Fran Eden and Luz Escarilla, the first women doctors to reach the rank, expressed willingness to receive the Sinovac vaccine.Breach in protocolMeanwhile, Malacañang admitted yesterday that protocols were breached when Interior Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority public services head Michael Salalima and Quezon Rep. Helen Tan were vaccinated despite the policy prioritizing healthcare workers.“We are not perfect in implementing protocol, we had breaches but we learned from it and now, everyone knows it’s medical frontliners first,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque said.National Task Force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. said the breach in prioritization protocols merits a probe.“There are no directives like that. That’s wrong, what we have is all medical frontliners, the 1.7 million (medical) frontliners would be prioritized for now. We don’t have enough vaccines… we will investigate that just in case there was indeed an occurrence like that,” Galvez said.On the other hand, Tan denied receiving special treatment and argued she received the vaccine slot through her son, a surgeon at Veterans Memorial Medical Center.“I would like to ask the public not to perceive this as VIP treatment, since it is totally false and misguided, inasmuch as I am a legal dependent, an immediate family member of a frontliner working as a medical professional at the VMMC,” the congresswoman, a doctor by profession, lamented. — Rudy Santos, Romina Cabrera, Robertzon Ramirez, Edu Punay, Michelle Zoleta, Tina Mendez, Neil Jayson Servallos",Philstar

He also thanked the donor countries, which include members of the European Union, a bloc that he had cursed in the past for alleged interference in domestic issues.""I don't know how to express my gratitude to [you],"" he said. ""That you remembered the poor nations is in fact already a plus for humanity..I'd like to say again that we felt the gratitude in our hearts.""""May God bless you for your benevolence,"" he also said.WHO representative in the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe, speaking at the brief ceremony, said that although vaccines have been arriving, preventive measures should not be abandoned. ""Nobody is safe until everyone is safe,"" he also said.The vaccines from the COVAX facility were expected to arrive in February, as the administration sought to give dates that later on turned out to be estimates.AstraZeneca's jabs secured emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration in late January after Pfizer did, and was followed by Sinovac.The government's vaccination program started this week with 600,000 doses donated by Beijing, the first to reach the Philippines last week,Taken in two doses, the AstraZeneca vaccine was found to be 70% effective on average. On Wednesday, however, a member of the OCTA Research team warned that its efficacy rate could decrease to just 10% against the new COVID-19 variant first seen in South Africa that has already been detected in the country.But the health department in a briefing earlier Thursday sought to allay such fears, saying the studies cited had a small sample of individuals.It came as South Africa halted the rollout of AstraZeneca after trials there showed a poor showing against combating the said variant. To which, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vegeire said: ""No matter what the publications say that its efficacy has gone lower, until we are not certain, we will continue to use the vaccines.""The arrival marks an important step in the vaccination efforts in the country, as some health workers — first in line to receive the jabs — sought alternatives to Sinovac.Government said too that medical workers above 60 could be prioritized to get Pfizer vaccines, since Sinovac is not recommended for senior citizens.All donations, none boughtCOVAX facility's allocation is different from the direct procurement by government to vaccine manufacturers.The European Union, for one, said it has provided € 2.2 billion to help countries gain access to vaccines, including the Philippines.In a statement, EU's ambassador to the country Luc Véron said the union ""has both a responsibility and interest to make vaccines available for all,"" adding that the union is the ""biggest contributor"" to the COVAX's donation to the country.To date, only term sheets have have been signed, with no purchase deals yet. The supplies from Sinovac and AstraZeneca are also donations.This means that despite officials' repeated pronouncements that the country will have enough supplies this year, the administration has yet to spend the allocated P72.5 billion meant to buy vaccines, funding that is from money borrowed from multilateral sources such as the World Bank.",Philstar

They were vaccinated with unauthorized and smuggled Sinopharm vaccines in late 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte himself disclosed last December.The innoculation mess drew widespread criticism and calls for accountability, but local regulators said their investigation has hit a ""blank wall"" with no cooperation from the PSG. A similar probe into the use of the same smuggled vaccines by columnist Mon Tulfo, ""Cabinet-level"" officials and a senator are similarly likely to go nowhere.Medical experts warned that failing to hold someone responsible for the unauthorized vaccinations could set a bad precedent for bringing in medicines or other vaccines into the country.They also said that justifying the apparent disregard for the law could undermine vaccination efforts in the country, at a time when public mistrust of the jabs has remained high.Health workers are at the top of government's priority list to get the jabs. But only days into vaccinations, incidents of some officials receiving the jabs despite not being on the list have drawn flak.Later on sought for comment, presidential spokesperson in a briefing admitted ""breaches"" into the vaccination program.""Courtesy of these three incidents, everyone should now know that the first vaccines are only for medical frontliners,"" he said partly in Filipino.

(Sinopharm) has also developed a coronavirus vaccine.Only Sinovac’s CoronaVac has been authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, while Sinopharm’s jab is still being reviewed by the drug regulator.There have been some fears, particularly from opposition lawmakers, that China is deploying vaccine diplomacy, or using its access to vaccines to force countries to bend to its will.Top government officials have downplayed these concerns, with Malacañang even saying that the donations would not affect the country’s territorial claims in the West Philippine Sea.China considers the West Philippine Sea, or the part of the South China Sea within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, as part of its territory despite a 2016 arbitral ruling that held that its territorial claims in the area have no legal basis.It also passed in January a new law that allows Chinese coast guard to fire at foreign vessels and demolish structures built on contested islands, which prompted the Department of Foreign Affairs to lodge a diplomatic protest and the Armed Forces of the Philippines to increase its naval presence in the West Philippine Sea.During the course of his administration, Duterte has made a remarkable pivot to China, warming up ties with the Asian giant.He has also made clear his preference for Chinese vaccines, especially for the still-unauthorized Sinopharm jabs.Smuggled Sinopharm vaccines were used to inoculate members of Duterte’s security group.

The local company also needs to present proof it is the distributor of Sinopharm in the country. Related StoriesFDA says China's Sinopharm applied for emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine“Once they submit the documents, we will begin the evaluation,” Domingo said in a public briefing Wednesday. “Until we see scientific evidence, we see the population involved in their Phase 3 clinical trials, their experience in using the vaccine in other countries, that’s the only time we can give recommendation on the use of the vaccine,” he added.The drug regulator confirmed Tuesday the receipt of an online application seeking emergency use authorization for the jab developed by China’s state-owned pharmaceutical company.Domingo earlier said it may take “around four to six weeks” before the agency can decide on the application because Sinopharm has yet to receive EUA from a stringent regulatory authority or from the World Health Organization. The lack of relevant documents may delay it further.“We’re very objective in approving vaccines. We have a checklist of what we’re looking for: safety, efficacy and quality,” he said.Interim analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials showed that Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine was 79.3% effective in preventing the disease, lower than the reported efficacy rates of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna of 95% and 94.1%, respectively. The data, however, have not been peer-reviewed.So far, only the vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac Biotech have obtained EUAs from the FDA. The application of Russia’s Gamaleya for its COVID-19 vaccine remains pending.The jab developed by Sinopharm is the one preferred by President Rodrigo Duterte.It was the same vaccine used by members of the Presidential Security Group, special envoy to China Mon Tulfo, some “Cabinet-level” officials and a senator in an unauthorized vaccine activity last year.The country began its delayed COVID-19 vaccination campaign Monday, with health workers, government officials and uniformed personnel the first in the line to receive donated Sinovac shots.",Philstar

Essentially, this means that the P72.5 billion that Congress approved for vaccine purchase has yet to be spent.Officials this week sought to explain that the delay in the jabs' arrival was due to supply shortages and logistical concerns.Dr. Rabindra Abeyashinge, the World Health Organization's representative to the country, told CNN Philippines that bottlenecks are hampering the delivery. This includes drugmakers ""unable to meet manufacturing targets, because these are biological processes, and they couldn't proce the quantities that they anticipated they could early on.""""These vaccines need to be transported,"" he said, ""maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world… Now this is causing a challenge.""Apart from the AstraZeneca, some 117,000 doses of Pfizer was also allocated to the country under the COVAX. But vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. bluntly said the country should not expect anytime soon its arrival as the jabs are in high demand in many countries.The arrival of another brand of a COVID-19 vaccine is now more than ever crucial with inoculations already underway with the Chinese-made Sinovac.Significantly, health workers were the first to receive this, despite the Food and Drug Administration earlier advising against administering it to them, after clinical trials in Brazil showed a lower efficacy rate among those dealing with COVID-19 patients.On March 1, the group Alliance of Health Workers in a protest called on government to give medical personnel ""better options for vaccine that have the highest efficacy rate.""""Many from our ranks have been infected and some died in combating the deadly virus,"" said Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the employees' association at the Lung Center of the Philippines. ""Our health and lives are always at stake.

But it faces challenges not limited to the stock of coveted jabs but also reluctance of the public, including medical frontliners.Rollout for general publicGalvez also said the vaccine rollout for the general public may start in late April, at the earliest.The vaccination of senior citizens and indigent families—which are included in the government’s priority list—may also begin around the same period.“Our projection for the general public as well as the senior citizens, poor families and vulnerable communities, we will start general public inoculations more or less late April or May,” he said.The government is aiming to inoculate 70 million people—about 60% of the population—this year.Galvez earlier said only 5.1 million of the 161 million doses expected this year will arrive in the country in the first quarter.

So whatever the vaccine (brand is), what’s important is we have the freedom to choose which vaccines we want,” she said, stressing that protection against the disease is better than none.Mayor Vico Sotto said Sabarre’s willingness to receive vaccines would help drum up confidence in vaccines.“When we see she’s safe (after receiving the vaccines) and strong as always, the confidence level is expected to rise,” Sotto said.Pasig began vaccinating health workers yesterday with only half of the 300 initially scheduled vaccine recipients opting to get injected. Health workers from Pasig City General Hospital and the Children’s Hospital were reportedly afraid of receiving vaccines.While Sotto said the city would respect their decision to opt out of receiving the Sinovac vaccines, he reiterated his call to trust experts.“When the Department of Health, doctors, Food and Drug Administration and regulatory counterparts in other countries, and experts say a particular vaccine brand is safe and effective, we can be sure that these are indeed safe and effective,” he said.The resistance was also understandable, he added, since more data and trial results have yet to come in.

We are looking at how we can accelerate delivery,” he said in a television interview.The WHO official also underscored that on the global level, they are seeing two bottlenecks for the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccines.First is that pharmaceutical companies could not meet the manufacturing targets for the vaccines.“These are biological processes and they could not produce the quantities they anticipated they could early on,” Abeyasinghe said.The other bottleneck is on the delivery process.“These vaccines need to be transported. Maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world,” Abeyasinghe said.He added that 190 countries have signed up to the COVAX facility, anticipating to receive COVID-19 vaccines.The WHO official said the “consignments are ready and just logistics arrangements are being made.”“So once we have a finalization and a confirmed itinerary of the delivery, we will share that information… I don’t want to create any expectations until we have a firm date,” he added.Sinopharm EUAMeanwhile, Duterte is waiting for the approval of the emergency use application (EUA) of Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm, Malacañang said yesterday.Duterte is a senior citizen, but he is not expected to be among the first to be inoculated in the government’s vaccination program.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend administering Sinovac vaccines – the first COVID-19 shots to arrive in the country – to health workers and senior citizens despite the approval of its EUA. The China-made vaccine posted only a 50.4-percent efficacy rate among health care workers exposed to the coronavirus.Last Monday, Roque said a Palace legal team is studying whether the 75-year-old Duterte can be vaccinated with jabs manufactured by Sinopharm, which has secured a compassionate use license. The issue, however, has become moot and academic because Sinopharm has already applied for EUA, according to the Palace spokesman.“That question is already moot and academic because the President will be waiting for the EUA because I reported yesterday (March 1) that Sinopharm has applied for EUA. He will just wait for the approval of Sinopharm,” Roque said at a press briefing yesterday.In an interview, FDA director general Eric Domingo said Sinopharm submitted an application online Monday afternoon.“We are looking at the documents now to see if the documents are complete or if there are any documents that need to be submitted before we officially accept the application,” Domingo added.In December last year, the Presidential Security Group (PSG) admitted that some of its members had received COVID-19 shots ahead of the FDA’s approval of the local use of COVID-19 vaccines.PSG chief Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III defended the vaccination, saying Duterte’s security aides need to ensure that they do not pose a threat to the President’s health and safety.Last Sunday, Duterte, who has expressed readiness to be vaccinated in public, said he would heed his doctor’s advice on what COVID-19 shot to get.“We have to be careful. I have my own doctor. She thinks that another brand… I will not mention it, I will just wait for it. She is waiting for it,” the President said at a press conference at Villamor Airbase.“On the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage. It is to my self-interest that I should get one. No doubt about it. As to what brand, that’s the problem because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added.Clinical trialsHealth Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire yesterday said Janssen Pharmaceuticals is conducting clinical trials in the country for its two-dose regiment COVID-19 vaccines.Vergeire added that Janssen is looking at the possibility that the two-dose vial is more efficacious against the coronavirus or will give higher immunity.Aside from Janssen, the FDA had also allowed Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals to do clinical trials in the Philippines. – Sheila Crisostomo, Alexis Romero",Philstar

This should not change even with COVID-19,” Lopez said.He said employees should have an option.“Anyway if an employee is not vaccinated, he or she is the one at risk of getting COVID-19,” Lopez said.The labor group said the government should immediately act to prevent the discriminatory and coercive mandatory vaccination in some workplaces.Based on internal surveys initiated by some companies, the ALU said a large number of working people are reluctant to be vaccinated for fear of adverse or side effects.In Iloilo City, the local government intends to enforce a “no vaccine, no work” policy in public and private offices operating in the city, it said.“This mandatory workplace policy is a form of coercion and discrimination, which violates the right of workers to freely decide and chose for themselves, particularly with regards to their health and well-being,” the group said.ALU vice president Gerard Seno said the group is advocating for the vaccination of all workers and pushing for the prioritization of essential workers to be inoculated with safe and effective vaccines.Seno said the decision of any person not be vaccinated should be respected and employers could only persuade employees with the benefits and advantages of being vaccinated.Sen. Joel Villanueva pressed for the immediate vaccination of workers, saying it is the only way for the economy to recover.Villanueva, chair of the Senate labor committee, said he moved for the inclusion of workers in the vaccination program’s priority lane as he knew that unless workers are given back their jobs, the economy will have a difficult time recovering.“We believe that we will be able to recover only if our workers are protected,” Villanueva said in a radio interview.He cited data showing up to 17 million workers lost their jobs at the height of the enhanced community quarantine from March to April.Millions of families suffered economically due to the pandemic, which hit the country in March 2020, he said.P100 wage hikeMeanwhile, labor group Defend Job Philippines yesterday called for an immediate action on the pending petition for a P100 across-the-board wage increase for workers nationwide.“We hope the labor department and the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) will act immediately on our petition as this is an urgent matter for Filipino workers in the wake of a pandemic,” Defend Jobs spokesman Christian Lloyd Magsoy said.NWPC executive director Criselda Sy gave assurance that the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) is acting on the petition filed by Defend Jobs Philippines.“The petition was filed before the RTWPB-NCR. The board is acting on the petition,” Sy said.Magsoy said prices of commodities and services are steadily going up at this time of pandemic, except for the wages of workers.Based on the group’s oil price monitoring, Magsoy said, the costs of gasoline and diesel increased eight times since January this year.“The series of big-time hikes on the costs of oil and petroleum products was an additional burden to the already loaded shoulders of Filipino workers in the light of the consistent price surges of basic commodities and services in this time of a pandemic,” Magsoy said in a statement.He said the government must immediately do something to stop these unlimited oil price hikes.Aside from intervening in the deregulated status of oil pricing in the country, Magsoy said the government should also prioritize and speed up the implementation of a P100 emergency wage relief.The group filed a formal wage petition before the NCR wage board on Monday.",Philstar

Carlito Galvez, said the national government will add more doses for Cebu.“Yung Region 7, padagdagan po natin kasi tumataas po kasi ang kanilang kaso po doon at tsaka may mga variants na po doon, so padagdagan po natin,” he said.Dr. Gerardo Aquino, Jr., VSMMC chief of hospital, said they wanted to have 2,900 health workers to get the vaccine but several have expressed apprehension against Sinovac.Loreche said that the doses that will not be used in Cebu will be given to other hospital health care workers in the region retained by DOH.Dr. Van Philip Baton, DOH-7 medical coordinator for infectious diseases, called on the public to give the vaccine a chance as it work and proven to be effective, safe, and has saved lives.He said vaccination is the only way for the country to achieve herd immunity once a large portion of the population is inoculated.Dr. Junjie Zuasula, head of DOH-7’s Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, echoed Baton’ statement.“Achieving herd immunity will take time. It will also depend on the supply of vaccines. But one thing is certain – we will achieve herd immunity in due time,” Zuasula said during a forum of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV).Emotional ArrivalRetired Major General Melquiades Feliciano, Visayas implementer of the Inter-Agency Task Force, had volunteered to be vaccinated on March 4.He described the arrival of the vaccine at the Mactan Cebu International Airport as being emotional.“Oo, medyo naging emotional dahil at long last, dumating. Diba, ito yung pinakahihintay natin? Masaya lang talaga, masaya, hindi lungkot,” Feliciano told The Freeman.His wife, Mia, said on Facebook: “Cried happy tears. Light at the end of the tunnel.”Feliciano said some doses will be given to workers in other government hospitals and, if there will be doses left, barangay health care workers can benefit.He is hoping that vaccines from AstraZenica will finally arrive in the Philippines.Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales of OPAV said Cabinet members and key IATF officials, including Galvez, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque will be in Cebu tomorrow, March 4.Business SectorBusinessman Kenneth Cobonpue, chairperson of the Regional Development Council in Central Visayas, said the business sector is very eager for the vaccination.Cobonpue said getting people vaccinated is one of the best ways to revive the economy further, especially in Central Visayas where travel and tourism play a huge role in people’s income.But while the vaccines give a glimmer of hope, Loreche reminded the public to still observe minimum health protocols against COVID-19.China DonationSinovac’s CoronaVac is the third COVID-19 vaccine brand, aside from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA).At least 600,000 doses of the Coronavac arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, February 28. The vaccines arrived at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board a Chinese military plane.President Rodrigo Duterte viewed the crate containing the vaccine doses and inspected the actual vaccine vials before the vaccines were transported in at least six 40-footer trucks to cold chain storage facilities that include the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and the Metropac Logistics in Marikina City.In an earlier report, Sinovac is among three vaccines being considered by Cebu City for its own vaccination program alongside Novavax/Covovax and AstraZenica.Novavax has a pending EUA application.The city is no longer considering Pfizer-BioNtech, the first vaccine to be given an EUA in the country, mainly due to storage concerns. — Caecent No ot-Magsumbol, JMO (FREEMAN)",Philstar

That is why yesterday’s session was monumental as we already agreed on a resolution that was authored by Garcia (and) Archival, bringing the letter of intent to Mayor Labella to the pharmaceuticals,” said Vice Mayor Michael Rama, the city’s lead convenor for vaccine rollout.The two vaccine brands which the City Council, the convenor body, and the multi-sectoral group have agreed to enter into an agreement with soon are AstraZenica and Covovax/Novavax.AstraZenica already has an Emergency Use Authorization while Covovax’s application is still under review.Sinovac, while also given nod by the Cebu City government, is no longer an option since it is already under the national government’s vaccination program.“With regard to the Sinovac vaccine, since the national government has already purchased the same, the Cebu City government will wait for the guidelines as to how it should be implemented and distributed to the constituents, mindful (of) the latter’s right to choose which vaccine to receive,” part of the resolution states.Rama reiterated that the council is also open to other vaccine brands, such as Pfizer and Moderna, as long as they have secured an EUA, do not need ultra-cold storage, and the price is reasonable.“We are not limiting it to other vaccines if they get the FDA’s EUA. But we have to consider the costs and storage. It’s going to be a nightmare if it needs ultra-storage,” the vice mayor said.The City Council is expected to finalize the number of vaccines to be purchased before entering into a purchase agreement.The city government initially set aside P400 million for the purchase of vaccines against COVID-19.Meanwhile, the council also had initial discussions on the city’s vaccine priorities as well as vaccination sites, vaccinators, and other personnel needed in its vaccination program.The proposed vaccination drive-thru had also been scrapped after Dr. Ilya Abellanosa of the Cebu City Health Department said individuals that have been vaccinated need to be monitored yet for some time before being allowed to go home.Councilor Alvin Dizon also opened up on the possibility of having a “house-to-house” vaccination for seniors and PWDs which Abellanosa said is already being considered in their initial plan. — with Decemay P.

The decision of any person not be vaccinated should be respected in the same way we respect those who had taken the vaccine,” said Gerard Seno, ALU national executive vice president.Seno said that employers should only try to persuade employees with the benefits and advantages of being vaccinated, but they should not coerce them to get the shot.ALU said that some factory workers have complained to them about how their superiors have told them that they would not be allowed to report to work unless they participate in the company-sponsored coronavirus vaccination drive.It added that other business owners have given instructions to supervisors and managers to deem employees who do not get vaccinated against COVID-19 as unfit to work.It also said that another group of employees have been told that they would need to present a certification to prove that they have received a COVID-19 jab before they are allowed to work.Meanwhile, Iloilo City is mulling to mandate all employees in the city to get vaccinated against COVID-19 before they are allowed to work.“Before it becomes a norm, the Department of Labor and Employment must respond quickly to these surfacing abuses and provide immediate protection measure by outlawing these unfair and unjust treatment of employees,” Seno said.While the government targets to inoculate 60 million to 70 million people in the hopes of achieving herd immunity, it is not making COVID-19 vaccines mandatory. — Xave Gregorio",Philstar

I’m not sure if they filed online,” FDA chief Eric Domingo said in a text message.So far, the FDA had granted EUA to Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac.Still under evaluation are the applications of Gamaleya-Sputnik of Russia and Bharat Biotech Covaxin.Speaking to reporters at the Villamor Air Base last Sunday, Duterte said he would follow his doctor’s advice on which COVID-19 vaccine to take.“We (people who are in their 70s) have to be careful. I have my own doctor. She thinks that another brand, I will not mention it, I will just wait for it. She is waiting for it,” the President said at his first press conference since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.“In the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage. It is to my self-interest that I should get one. No doubt about it. As to what brand, that’s the problem because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added.Asked to react to Vice President Leni Robredo’s statement that he should be the first to be inoculated to boost public confidence in the COVID-19 shots, Duterte said: “Siya man ‘yong apurado, siya ang mauna (She’s the one so eager so she should be the first). I cannot just decide. She’s young, I am not.”“Why make a drama out of who should be the first? The problem is my doctor is waiting for something,” he added.Roque said the President would inform the public if he experiences side effects after getting vaccinated.“The President has promised that once he gets inoculated, it (would) be held publicly... Of course, we will inform you about the side effects if any on the President. But since he has not yet received a vaccine, that is moot and academic,” the Palace spokesman said.“Let me clarify. What is stated in the Constitution is the President has the obligation to make public his medical condition only if he has a serious illness,” he added.Duterte said health workers who do not want Sinovac vaccines can wait for the AstraZeneca shots expected within this month.“They have a choice, it’s either... AstraZeneca or Sinovac. If they do not want Sinovac, they have to wait... I was assured that it would be coming within the next few days,” the President said.Duterte stressed there would be no forced vaccination.“Now, for those who do not want to be vaccinated, that’s OK with me. I have no problem. You do not want vaccines? OK, that’s your choice,” he added.Sen. Bong Go said key government officials have asked to be vaccinated first so they could inspire confidence in the vaccines and not because they are priority.“It’s not a question anymore if the President is willing to be vaccinated in public or not because we all want to be vaccinated. We are doing this not because we are the priority. We will do this to show the public that we should trust the vaccine,” Go said.Go also expressed his willingness to be vaccinated in public together with Duterte to demonstrate the vaccines’ safety and efficacy. Go chairs the Senate committee on health and demography.Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said they haven’t received any complaint from military personnel regarding their mandatory COVID-19 vaccination.“It’s not true that many are complaining. If they don’t want Sinovac they will still be vaccinated by other brands. And if there are no free doses available, they will have to pay for them,” he told reporters in English and Filipino.AFP chief of staff Lt. Gen.

I did not feel it when I was being vaccinated,” he said in an interview, adding that a few hours after receiving the vaccine, he still could not feel anything even on the injection site.“Of course I have to monitor myself in the next 24 hours… But (so far), I do not feel soreness and systemic symptoms like fever,” Domingo said.At 52 years and being a health care worker, he noted that he fits the criteria for Sinovac vaccinees.Meanwhile, members of the Alliance of Health Workers at LCP staged a “lunch break” to denounce what they called government’s “consistent inconsistencies” in the vaccination program against COVID-19.The group’s president, Robert Mendoza, said they are “dismayed at the sudden turnaround decision of the government to inoculate health care workers (HCWs) with Sinovac”?as this is “sacrificing the health and safety of the health workers.”He added that the government is “practically forcing HCWs to accept Sinovac vaccines, called CoronaVac.”Eleazar Sobinsky, LCP Employees Association president, said HCWs deserve the best vaccine against the novel virus as their “health and lives are always at stake.”Sobinsky stressed that it would not be enough for the government to simply indemnify health care workers “who will suffer severe side effects or death due to the COVID-19 vaccines.”“We want the government and health authorities to be held accountable in indemnifying victims of severe effects of the vaccine,” he added.Fr. Marlito Ocon, one of the chaplains at PGH, said he preferred to wait for other anti-COVID vaccines to arrive and have options as he expressed his belief that both patients and frontliners should wait for what they deem as the “best vaccine” against the coronavirus.“I’d rather wait for the best one if there are other (brands) that are coming… It is not as if that (Sinovac) is the only vaccine that would arrive in the country or that is the only vaccine available so we have to take the risk for the sake also of the people we serve, our patients and to all frontliners who are here at the hospital,” Ocon told the Catholic church-run Radio Veritas.He revealed that during a meeting with the Department of Health (DOH) at PGH last Sunday, a survey conducted by the hospital that showed 95 percent were against being vaccinated with Sinovac was mentioned.One common reason for this is that they would no longer be able to avail themselves of other vaccines brands if they get inoculated with CoronaVac. – Sheila Crisostomo, Evelyn Macairan",Philstar

There is no best vaccine because the best vaccines are those which are effective and efficient and come early,” Galvez stressed.Also among those inoculated yesterday were National Task Force against COVID-19 deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium (formerly Tala Hospital) in Caloocan City and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Benhur Abalos at the PGH.Although Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana wanted to be among the first to receive the Sinovac vaccine to build trust and confidence among personnel in the Department of National Defense, he gave in to the advice of doctors who said those above 59 years old should not be inoculated.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, 64, was also not given a jab, but he administered the vaccine to some doctors during a symbolic vaccination at the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) in Quezon City.The Department of Health said the secretary “will be vaccinated when the appropriate vaccine becomes available.”In a speech, Duque urged health care workers to allow themselves to be immunized against COVID-19, giving assurance that all vaccines evaluated by the Vaccine Expert Panel and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are safe and effective.“Millions of people have already received donated Sinovac vaccines, not only in China but in 53 other countries. And based on latest data, the ‘adverse event following immunization (AEFI)’ rate is two to five per million doses. It means that’s the only risk for AEFI,” he said.The “benefit versus risk ratio” of getting a jab against COVID-19 shows benefits far outweigh the risks, he added.The Philippines received last Sunday 600,000 doses of vaccines manufactured by the Chinese drug-maker Sinovac, the first COVID-19 jabs to be delivered in the country.A recent survey by OCTA Research indicated that only 19 percent of adult Filipinos are willing to be inoculated against COVID-19 while 46 percent prefer to pass due to safety concerns.Speaking at the ceremonial vaccination of health care workers at PGH, Galvez said getting a COVID-19 shot is a “moral obligation.”“There is no such thing as best vaccine because the best vaccine is the one that is effective and efficient and that which arrive earlier. This is a moral obligation of everyone. All of us should get ourselves vaccinated and let us not wait for what they call the best vaccine,” he said, noting that some vaccines with high efficacy rates would not be available until the third or fourth quarter.The efficacy rate of Sinovac-developed vaccines only stood at 50.4 percent among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19 but officials have maintained it is still effective against the virus. They have also noted that the World Health Organization has set a 50 percent threshold for vaccine efficacy.First in lineThe 59-year-old Dr. Eileen Aniceto – the most senior physician among 19 other pulmonologists at the LCP – was the first to receive a shot of CoronaVac that Duque personally administered.All 20 health workers who have been handling COVID-19 patients at the LCP received their COVID-19 jabs yesterday.“This vaccine, in case you do get COVID-19, will give you a better chance of surviving this infection,” Aniceto told reporters after receiving her jab.Delays on the delivery of vaccines muffled rising public anticipation but the arrival of Sinovac doses wasn’t particularly a cause for excitement either, especially for health care workers on top of the priority list of vaccine recipients.Several health professionals have begged off from receiving CoronaVac in several hospitals in Metro Manila. At the LCP, about 90 percent of all its medical staff have agreed to receive vaccines if these were Pfizer’s.“When we started our preparations for the vaccination, 90 percent agreed when it was Pfizer,” said Dr. Vincent Balanag Jr., LCP’s executive director.Dr. Chette Moje, LCP’s vaccination task force chief, said that as of yesterday only 140 hospital staff members gave their consent to receive CoronaVac. The LCP received 600 doses.Balanag said there are about 1,400 health care workers in LCP.“When we learned it’s Sinovac, of course, we all know the discussions on this one, that’s why we had a town hall meeting the day after we learned it’s Sinovac and we were told that Sinovac has its advantages,” he said.For Dr. Edward Cervales, a fellow at the Department of Pulmonology, it was a personal decision not to wait for Pfizer vaccines that he and thousands of other colleagues in the region were supposed to receive last month.“If ever we wouldn’t get vaccinated with the vaccine we have now, we wouldn’t promote more public trust in the vaccination program and I think it’s about time we move forward,” he said before receiving the jab.“It’s my personal decision to at least set an example also. Because we’ve been treating COVID-19 for almost a year and I think this is somewhat the cure eventually so physicians have to start somewhere, somehow,” he added.Health care workers from COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila were supposed to have received Pfizer vaccines about two weeks ago when the government said the rollout of the first batch of vaccines from the Covax Alliance would arrive, only to be snagged by the lack of an indemnity deal.But Dr. Alfonso Victorino Famaran Jr., medical director of the DJNRMHS or Tala Hospital in Caloocan City, believed that the vaccine he received yesterday would give him the “soonest protection” against the virus even though he would have preferred another brand.“My reason why I chose to inoculate myself with Sinovac is because I will grab the first opportunity to have myself protected against COVID-19,” he said.At the Philippine National Police, PNP General Hospital chief Lt. Col. Cleto Manongas was the first police officer to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, followed by Health Service director Brig. Gen. Luisito Magnaye and PNPGH deputy chief Lt. Col. Raymond Ona.At least 200 PNP personnel from the Health Service were vaccinated yesterday while 600 more in the coming days are expected to be inoculated with Sinovac jabs.PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said no one from the police force has backed out from receiving the China-made vaccines and the police force would be prioritizing personnel assisting in the distribution of vaccines, members of the medical reserve force and others directly dealing with COVID-19 patients.“We are very vulnerable because we are one of the agencies spearheading the security and assisting (in the vaccination program),” he said yesterday, adding that the PNP wants to assist the government in achieving herd immunity.Speaker Lord Allan Velasco will lead the House of Representatives officials to be inoculated when the vaccine allocation for the chamber arrives.“Our election leaders should be at the forefront to be able to show the people that we really need the vaccine and that this is really necessary for us to be able to control and contain the pandemic,” he said. – Michael Punongbayan, Alexis Romero, Jose Rodel Clapano, Ghio Ong, Neil Jayson Servallos, Delon PorcallaRelated video:",Philstar

We have one million from Sinovac,” Galvez said.He said there is already a purchase order or PO for the acquisition of one million doses for P700 million.“We have funds. We have P700 million funds,” Galvez pointed out. “Once we sign it, the one million doses will arrive this coming March in tranches. We saw 500,000 doses loaded onto an airplane. So, that would be in two tranches.”Sinovac Biotech general manager Helen Yang told ANC they are still discussing details of the shipment with the Philippine government.“The vaccine showed a good safety profile and strong efficacy results to prevent the severe cases and could lower down the burdens of the health care system,” Yang said.“We sincerely hope that the Philippines will start to use the vaccine and help reboot the economy,” she added.Galvez said the country’s supply agreements with other COVID-19 vaccine brands Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and Novavax were still pending.Aside from Sinovac, other COVID-19 vaccine brands issued emergency use authorization by the Philippine FDA were Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.Galvez also said there is no definite date yet for arrival of 3.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines due to global shortage of vaccines.Based on previous announcement, AstraZeneca vaccines were supposed to arrive yesterday, under the COVAX Facility.“There is no definite date yet. We have seen the reality on the ground. The global shortage of supply is acute,” Galvez said.Galvez also said the first batch of the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech would likely be delivered by the second quarter. The delivery was initially announced to happen in mid-February.After seeing surveys showing low public confidence in the Sinovac vaccine, the President – Galvez said – ordered him and other top officials to be inoculated with it.At the Philippine General Hospital where he got inoculated with CoronaVac, Galvez said Filipinos would not be able to return to normal life and the economy would remain sluggish if they refuse to get immunized immediately and opt to wait for Western vaccines, which would come later in the year.“We should not wait for the so-called best vaccine. There is no best vaccine because the best vaccines are those which are effective and efficient and come early,” Galvez said.Supply shortageSome 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine from the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX facility were supposed to be delivered yesterday.“We understand the challenge COVAX is facing because they are supplying the global community. What they have said is that the date of arrival is indefinite. Hopefully, by first quarter,” Galvez said, explaining the delay in the delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines.Based on FDA evaluation, AstraZeneca has an efficacy rate of 70 percent after the first dose, a rate that will increase with the second dose after four to 12 weeks.The Philippines has reported 576,352 COVID-19 cases overall, with 12,318 recorded deaths.The government aims to inoculate 70 million of its 108 million people this year to achieve herd immunity and reopen an economy that in 2020 saw its worst contraction on record, due largely to tight restrictions on movement since mid-March.Galvez insisted that the Philippines might not move forward unless everyone is immunized. “It is our moral obligation,” said Galvez.At yesterday’s vaccination kick-off, PGH director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi was the first to be inoculated in public by a nurse, followed by Cabinet and health officials.Manila Mayor Isko Moreno urged the public to trust whatever vaccine is available.“Let’s get vaccinated, let’s save lives every day. We need to move on,” Moreno said, adding he would take his turn after a week.The Department of Health (DOH) said it is looking at two weeks to finish administering the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines.“We are looking at two weeks for us to be able to roll it out properly and then we will have the next two weeks to monitor if there would still be ‘quick substitution list (QSL)’ that will be used,” DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said.Vergeire noted in a television interview that they want to check the QSL to determine if there are alternative vaccines that have not been utilized.“So basically in two to three weeks, we will be able to utilize this because we already had a plan of rolling it out. Hospitals had been advised already and they are prepared and we started the rollout,” she added.Senators expressed hopes the Duterte administration’s COVID-19 mass vaccination program would not sputter but gain ground faster than the virus could infect Filipinos, who should also be given more vaccine choices.Honoring frontlinersSen. Joel Villanueva said that while 1,000 shots were given yesterday, 100 million more Filipinos need to be inoculated.“The journey of a hundred million shots begins with a single jab. But today’s events shouldn’t be seen as a mere symbolic start but as the start of something sustained, without letup and in numbers increasing by the week,” Villanueva said in a statement.“For that is how we can meaningfully mark the first year of the lockdown on March 15, by demonstrating our will to end COVID’s reign of terror, one injection at a time,” he said.He said a vaccination program done in earnest would also honor health frontliners who, along with the rest of the population, should be provided with more vaccine choices.Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said the government should match frontliners’ heroism with vaccine offensive or “the first shot in our nation’s counterattack against the virus.”That the first inoculation was given to PGH’s Legaspi “only underscores the moral responsibility of this government to support the continuing heroism of our frontliners with a vaccine offensive.”He called Legaspi the “ground commander of the biggest COVID-19 hospital.”It is also government’s duty to broaden the vaccine source or acquire “the best vaccines, the best human minds had developed,” he said.“The vaccines have arrived as we are letting our people go out of their towns freely. Our vaccine arsenal should then grow as fast as we are allowing people to move around unrestricted. Without vaccines, the virus will be faster and smarter than us,” Recto said.He said the newly signed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act brings big business to the vaccination drive – not to profit, but to use their massive wealth in vaccinating as many people as fast as possible.“With many sectors now enlisted in vaccine procurement and administration, the national government should lead from the front and not from the rear,” he said.Sen. Grace Poe said the euphoria over the first shipment of the vaccines should be matched with a clear sight on a systematic rollout of the inoculation process.“In making available the vaccine to health workers and other priority sectors, let us not forget our PUV drivers and other workers in the transportation sector who are key to our economic comeback,” Poe said.“Drivers along with the other groups in the priority list – senior citizens, teachers, OFWs, essential staff, frontline workers, indigent population – need the protection against the virus most because of their situation as we embark on the road to the new normal,” Poe said.Sen. Imee Marcos said the government must address immediately the high rate of hesitancy among Filipinos to get themselves vaccinated.“First order of business is to convince Filipinos to get vaccinated. Let’s make the best use of this endless vaccine delay and persuade our people, for their health and the safety of their family and friends, that they should get inoculated as quickly as possible with any FDA-approved vaccine,” Marcos said.“There is so much anxiety about side effects which are apparently rare and minimal – when the danger of infection is real and could be fatal.

This will guide the logistical requirements for transport, delivery and storage in every LGU from Luzon to Mindanao,” Marcos said.She said “the public is also at a loss on what benefits they are entitled to in case of injury or death.

She said no doses should be wasted.Dr. Van Baton, DOH-7 regional medical coordinator for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, said that the country targets to vaccinate 70 million of the population for the first year, another 40 million for the second year, and another 12 million for the third year.This is to attain herd immunity, Zuasula said as he appealed to everyone to give the COVID-19 vaccines a chance.Loreche, for her part, said “whatever vaccine is available, we have to use it.”5.6 million CV residentsIn Central Visayas, a total of 5,634,789 people are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.Loreche did not discuss how these people were identified nor did she provide a breakdown of the number. However, she said that there will be a total of 4,973 vaccination teams that will conduct the vaccination for 14 days.Security in placeMeanwhile, the Cebu City Police Office said security measures for the transport of the vaccines are already “in place” once they arrive here on Mar. 4.""Part sa security plan nga ipatuman sa PRO-7 (Police Regional Office) is ang pag-transport sa time nga maabot siya...

Please trust that this is something that will protect you because we have your best interest in mind,” noted Salvana, who is also the director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health.Salvana made the statement as the country is expecting some 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines to arrive from China today.A COVID-19 survivor, Salvana said that he is willing to take the Sinovac vaccine, as he admitted always fearing for his life.“As for me, I am excited. This is the resolution and we’ve been waiting for over a year and every day when I go out, I’m scared for my life – is this the patient that is going to infect me?” he added.Salvana said he does not want to let go of the chance to be inoculated against COVID-19.“Finally there is something that I can do, very tangible, aside from PPEs (personal protective equipment) and everything. That I know it is the start of the end of this nightmare,” he added.Salvana underscored that they respect if there are health care workers (HCWs) who would refuse Sinovac vaccines, but he reminded them that there is still “no clarity” as to when the next vaccines will come.“This is an emergency, this is a pandemic, there is a clear and present danger to HCWs,” he maintained.Last Friday, DOH-TAG and National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) had approved the use of Sinovac vaccines among HCWs directly handling COVID-19 patients.This is after the Food and Drug Administration had recommended against the inoculation of HCWs with the China-made vaccine because it will have an efficacy rate of only 50.4 in this group.But according to NITAG member Maria Corazon Quizon, the 50.4 percent effective rate is for the prevention of mild infection of COVID-19.Quizon said data show that the vaccine is 70 percent effective against moderate cases and “approaching” 100 percent effective in preventing severe cases of COVID-19“Something got lost in translation. When they said the vaccine efficacy is 50.4 percent in preventing mild infection, they did not complete the sentence that it’s 70 percent effective in preventing moderate cases and approaching 100 percent in preventing severe cases,” she added.She maintained this means that Sinovac vaccines are still able to protect the HCWs.“That is what we want at the end of the day – to prevent the moderate and severe cases,” she said.Quizon pointed out that even after the vaccination program has been rolled out in the country, it is still very important for the health protocols to be strictly observed by the public to prevent the spread of COVID-19.“Just because there are already vaccines, it’s like fiesta already. It’s not like that. We still have to practice due diligence,” she added.Salvana has cautioned against “mixing” different brands of COVID-19 vaccines, saying it could be harmful.“Mixing vaccines might even be harmful… You could have a bad allergic reaction. There’s a lot of things that can go wrong. There is no data on mixing vaccines,” he told ‘The Chiefs.’Salvana noted in some cases, when giving vaccines “too close together, the second dose might not be safe.”He added this is because the immune system of those inoculated “might be prime for other vaccines.”Salvana said those who will be given the first dose of Sinovac vaccines will receive the second dose of the same brand.He maintained they are no longer eligible to get the next vaccines that will arrive in the country, also because of the global shortage of COVID-19 jabs.",Philstar

Both companies from Korea are WHO pre-qualified vaccine manufacturers.The two Korean firms are traditional vaccine manufacturers that produce vaccines used by the United Nations Children’s Fund.Glovax is in a joint venture with Eubiologics to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine and to build the local next generation COVID vaccine plant.National Policy Against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. endorsed Glovax Biotech to the Department of Science and Technology.The local company is also in talks with the DTI’s National Development Corporation for a possible investment collaboration.The vaccine plant will cost around P7 billion to construct, including technology transfer costs. Glovax said the plant would be capable of providing 40 million doses for domestic use should the government procure them.Glovax Biotech Corp. founder and CEO Giovanni Alingog said Glovax and Eubiologics are in the process of applying for the mergency use authorization (EUA).The EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics was developed in Western New York by POP Biotechnologies Inc. and has been approved for human clinical trials.The South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety approved the combined phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials last month.Glovax said that EuCorVac-19 COVID vaccine of Eubiologics was developed in the USA but it will be mass produced at the new facility of Eubiologics in South Korea and will also be manufactured in the Philippine plant.“It is estimated that the world could vaccinate all its population in seven years and the local vaccine plant can help reduce that time frame, especially for the Philippines,” Alingog said.The company said the Glovax proposal to produce the next generation COVID vaccine offers a lot of advantages as it can capture newer COVID strains and other mutations.Other vaccines, the company said, are only 22 percent effective against the new South African strain and other new strains found around the world.The next generation COVID vaccine can be stored up to 25ºC or room temperature up to three months and 2°C to 8°C for longer period.Glovax, the first vaccine company to bring in the first vaccine in 2009/2010 during the AH1N1 swine flu pandemic, said there was also a shortage of the pandemic vaccine at that time.“With this experience, Glovax is proposing a vaccine plant to avert the current and future pandemics,” Alingog said.The vaccine-focused company has been distributing polio, tuberculosis, measles, tetanus, Pentavalent and rabies vaccines and had sold more than 5 million doses of vaccines since 2003.",Philstar

Bong Go said yesterday.To be inoculated with these vaccines are military personnel, he added.Go said there is also the expected arrival of 520,000 doses of AstraZeneca from the COVAX Facility on Monday, which will give frontliners options on which vaccines they prefer.“Finally, the vaccines will arrive from China. This is what the Chinese government promised to donate to the Philippine government. At first, it was 500,000 doses but they will add 100,000 doses for the military personnel and that’s important because that is the timetable,” said Go in an interview over radio dwIZ.The 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines are good for 300,000 recipients who shall receive two doses each.“Another good news, we are waiting for the vaccine from COVAX. It will come on Monday from AstraZeneca – about 525,600 doses. I talked to (UK) Ambassador Daniel Pruce (and he) promised to help now,” said Go.The supply forms part of the 44 million doses of COVAX to inoculate 20 percent of the population. The vaccines will arrive at 12:15 p.m. on Monday. The government is working to acquire 5.2 million to 9.2 million AstraZeneca dosages from the COVAX facility.“We thank the World Health Organization, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund towards this end,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said.“We are grateful to everyone – from our medical frontliners to our fellow Filipinos and foreign partners – who stand by us in this challenging time. Together, we will heal and recover as one nation and one people,” he said.Roque also thanked UK Ambassador Pruce for his contribution in speeding up the processes for the vaccines’ arrival in the country.“We would like to thank UK Ambassador Pruce, for it was his intercession that became the reason for the swift arrival of AstraZeneca to the Philippines,” Roque added in Filipino.Go thanked the Chinese and UK governments for the vaccines, and said their arrival took a while as the government tried to ensure the vaccines complied with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards.“They are also looking at its safety data because it is useless if it comes and is not safe. We will prioritize the safety and efficacy of those being brought to the country before we start the rollout,” he said.“Now that vaccines will arrive from China, this is Sinovac and it is important for the public to see that the vaccine rollout is starting,” Go noted.He said President Duterte ordered the rollout to start immediately so the Chief Executive could reevaluate whether to gradually open up or talk again about declaring modified general community quarantine.Duterte inoculationGo maintained that the vaccination of President Duterte will be determined by his doctors considering his health condition.“The President – his doctor will decide what vaccine to use and the doctor is already choosing what is suitable for his age and health. That is the choice. The President will definitely get vaccinated; he will show it to the public,” he noted.Go said he will have his inoculation alongside with the President – not to take advantage of his position, but to encourage the public that getting the vaccine is safe.Simulation exercisesAt a public briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire noted they have been doing everything to prepare for the vaccine rollout.“Actually, we have been prepared for weeks already because we were expecting the Pfizer vaccines before and now, we are repeating and reviewing our preparations done before,” she added.Vergeire said that part of these preparations was full-scale simulation exercises of the arrival of the vaccines at the airport and delivery to cold chain storage and other logistics last Feb. 9.There were also simulation activities at the hospitals – from how the vaccines will be taken out of their boxes up to inoculating them to recipients, among others.She noted there is now a master list of vaccine recipients and a quick substitution list (QSL) of back-up vaccinees who will step in if an original recipient backs out.The QSL is based on the priortization framework wherein health care workers will be the first ones to be vaccinated against COVID-19.Vergeire added this means that the back-up vaccines will also come from hospitals, “ideally from hospitals near the initial hospitals or the source hospitals where the vaccination is being done.”“We are ensuring that, as much as possible, not a dose of the vaccine will be wasted because we know how important each dose of these vaccines is,” she maintained.Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) says it is “all ready” for the expected arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the country today.During the Laging Handa briefing yesterday morning, MMDA chairman Benhur Abalos said they are ready for the expected arrival of the Sinovac vaccines today.“There was a simulation and the result was good. The distribution and everything that needs to be done are already ironed out,” Abalos said in Filipino.“The vaccine route is ready. We are now ready, along with the police,” he added.Abalos also said they are considering the use of EDSA bus lanes during the delivery of the vaccines from Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.The vaccines are expected to be delivered to several hospitals in different cities in Metro Manila.“We could use the bus carousel. If not, the lanes beside the bus carousel could be used,” he said.Abalos revealed that they would be enforcing the same route for the arrival of the next batches of vaccines.Highest caseAs this developed, the Department of Health’s (DOH) Case Bulletin reported 2,921 new COVID-19 infections yesterday, the highest this year.The cases were documented on Feb.24, bringing the total number of infections to 574,247.Vergeire confirmed there has been an increase in cases in the past days and this can be attributed to “various factors” such as the easing of restrictions.She said there has also been complacency on the part of the public regarding minimum health standards such as wearing of masks and face shields and maintenance of physical distancing.The official also pointed out that the other factor is the “response of the LGUs” to the pandemic.“We have to scale up our response, particularly the quarantine and isolation protocol,” she added.Vergeire maintained that many people are now doing “home quarantine and this might be a cause or a factor” for the rise in cases in the country.DOH data further showed that 42 COVID-19 patients died, raising the death toll to 12,289. On the other hand, 293 cases have recovered, bringing the total recoveries to 524,865.The number of active cases was at 37,093 or 6.5 percent of the over-all cases. – Christina Mendez, Ralph Edwin Villanueva, Sheila Crisostomo",Philstar

(It’s) the second step,” HPACC member Antonio Dans said during an interview with “The Chiefs” on One News Wednesday night.Dans said there is no need to seek approval of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the technical review because the HTAC is mandated by law to evaluate. He explained that the FDA assesses mainly the safety and efficacy of vaccines while the HTAC review goes beyond health concerns.According to HPAAC, foreign donated technology during pandemics and emergencies must still undergo technical appraisal by HTAC in order to determine their clinical and economic value.“Though we welcome this donation and eagerly await other forthcoming donations from the COVAX Facility and from other donor entities as well, we however would still ask our leaders to await the recommendations of the HTAC,” the HPAAC said.Commercial use illegalMeanwhile, a principal author of the newly passed Emergency Vaccine Procurement Act explained that vaccines to be purchased under the measure can’t be used for commercial purposes.“Right now there is an abnormal supply situation, so if private entities will purchase, they can use it only for their employees for now and not sell it,” Quirino Rep. Junie Cua explained.Cua pointed out that centralizing procurement of vaccines through the national government is the most efficient way of acquiring the jabs. And although the measure allows procurement and purchase of vaccines to forgo public bidding during a pandemic, these are still subject to an audit.No blanket immunitySenate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said the government can’t grant absolute and blanket immunity to vaccine manufacturers because “it is against the law and contrary to public policy.”“Under the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act Congress passed last Feb. 22, COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are immune from suits for claims arising out of the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, but not for willful misconduct or gross negligence,” Drilon said.Drilon explained that any vaccinee can file claims for damages, based on the vaccine manufacturers liabilities arising from willful misconduct and gross negligence.The government recently allotted P500 million to compensate persons who may suffer adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, at a press briefing, Palace spokesman Harry Roque said President Duterte cannot compel columnist and former special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo to cooperate in the investigation about the alleged use of smuggled COVID-19 shots.“As far as Mon Tulfo is concerned, he clarified, he is no longer (a) special envoy to China. He is a private citizen so he can do as he pleases and the President is not in position to compel him to do anything, the President does not have subpoena powers,” Roque said.Roque added that it would be up to the police to look into reports about the unauthorized use of vaccines developed by Chinese firm Sinopharm. – Edu Punay, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Alexis Romero",Philstar

A friend in need is a friend indeed,” Ambassador Huang Xilian said,referring to China’s donating the vaccine doses to the Philippines.He expressed hope the arrival of the vaccines from China would kick off the Philippines’ nationwide inoculation program.A Chinese military transport plane will deliver the cargo of CoronaVac doses at the Villamor Air Base, according to a retired Filipino-Chinese official who requested anonymity.Sinovac general manager Helen Yang has confirmed the arrival this week of the vaccines now allowed for local application by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) through an emergency use authorization (EUA).“After we have the EUA issuance, we cleared everything from the approval side and now we need to complete the schedule of delivery and custom procedures that would normally take a few days,” she explained.Yang has also said Sinovac is “in close communication” with the Chinese embassy regarding the delivery of the vaccines.Upon their arrival, the vaccine doses would be loaded onto refrigerated vans – after undergoing customs procedures – and transported to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City.Despite the confirmation of the date of the vaccines’ arrival, the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force against COVID-19 (NTF) said a vaccine rollout is still being finalized.“Specific details as to the allocation and subsequent rollout of the 600,000 donated Sinovac doses are still being evaluated pending the official recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and its approval by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF),” a joint DOH-NTF statement read.“Details of the planned arrival ceremony are still currently being finalized in close coordination with the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China,” the NTF said.Yesterday, DOH reported that confirmed COVID cases nationwide jumped to 568,680 with the addition of 2,269 cases.Out of the total cases, DOH said 92.2 percent or 524,042 have survived the infection, including 738 additional recoveries.Active cases stand at 32,437, accounting for 5.7 percent of total cases. The bulk or 94.5 percent of the active cases are mild and asymptomatic.With additional 72 deaths, COVID-related fatalities rose to 12,201. The figure represents 2.15 percent of total cases.Health workers’ turnAnti-COVID task force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. said he hopes the arrival on Sunday of the vaccines would make possible the inoculation of medical frontliners by the first week of March.He confirmed a Chinese military aircraft would deliver the vaccines.Galvez also noted that some mayors, including Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, have volunteered to be vaccinated with Sinovac in public to boost the people’s confidence in the vaccine.Presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said 100,000 of the 600,000 doses scheduled to arrive on Sunday would be administered to soldiers and policemen.It was not clear whether President Duterte would push through with plans to personally welcome the shipment of vaccines at the airport.Roque could not tell the actual date of inoculation of medical frontliners but has told Philippine General Hospital chief Dr. Gap Legaspi that there might be a need to prepare those who have consented to get inoculated by Monday.“I will have to coordinate. But I know, all we need is one day and then we will roll out. So, if it arrives on Sunday, if I am not mistaken, then we can rollout on Monday, because many of our fellow countrymen are already very excited,” he said.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, meanwhile, again made a pitch for vaccination, saying it could at least protect an individual from getting severe case of COVID-19 even if it could not make him totally immune to the virus.“Number one, it will reduce death. Number two, it will reduce symptomatic cases, you can prevent the symptoms such as cough, fever and flu,” he said, explaining the vaccines’ benefits.“And it will prevent progression to severe form of COVID-19 infection. And, therefore, prevent hospitalization,” he said.Pitching for SinovacDuque said vaccines developed by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Sinovac have 100 percent efficacy rate in preventing severe COVID infection.“That’s the most important because deaths involved only those with severe cases,” he said.“So, if you are able to prevent severe infection, there will be no death. And Sinovac belongs to that group that offers or provides 100 percent efficacy or effectiveness. So I am not surprised that some countries, despite the indications in the issued emergency use authorization, they opted to still include their health care workers within the age group of 18 to 59 years,” Duque told the President at the IATF meeting on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the Department of Finance (DOF) has approved the inclusion of all COVID-19 vaccine imports under its Mabuhay express lane to expedite clearance of shipments and processing of tax and duty exemptions.Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III also approved the waiving of filing fees for vaccine applications under the Mabuhay Lane and the use of the Tax Exemption System (TES) Online Filing Module in processing of imports “to further support the government’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program.”Tax exemptions in the express lane, which is under the DOF’s revenue office, will be processed within 24 working hours.DOF said these tax exemption policies will be incorporated in the inter-agency guidelines for the implementation of a One-Stop Shop for International Donations and Government Procured COVID-19 Vaccines prepared by the DOF, DOH, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Bureau of Customs (BOC) and the FDA.Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko recommended the inclusion of COVID-19 vaccine imports in the express lane “regardless of the applicable legal basis,” to “allow for the expedited processing of the tax and exemption of such applications.”The finance chief is authorized to include additional sectors that may avail themselves of the express service under the Mabuhay Lane.Vaccines donated to government agencies and accredited private entities would also be processed in the express lane.“We add that the Mabuhay Lane currently processes all Relief Consignment under Section 120 in relation to 121 of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA). The Lane is expected to process all COVID-19 vaccines which may qualify as relief consignment,” said Tionko.Under the CMTA, relief consignment imported during a state of calamity and intended for the use of calamity victims shall be exempted from the payment of duties and taxes.The Mabuhay Lane was established to expedite the processing of applications for the tax and duty exemption of certain groups of importers, including export-oriented firms, returning residents, as well as non-profit, non-stock educational institutions. – Christina Mendez, Mayen Jaymalin, Neil Jayson Servallos, Czeriza Valencia",Philstar

The initial doses of 600,000 are a donation from Beijing, with whom the administration has fostered close ties.Related Stories94% of PGH employees sign up for vaccinationPhilippines OKs Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine for emergency useWhy the Sinovac vaccine isn't for medical workers, senior citizens despite FDA approval""Three more nights and the vaccines will already be here,"" he said in Filipino. "" What we are planning is for officials to welcome the arrival of the vaccines.""In a separate statement, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian confirmed that the vaccines will arrive on Sunday. ""Both teams have been working round the clock to make it happen,"" he said, referring to the Philippines and China.""A friend in need is a friend indeed. The donation of vaccines is another testament to the solidarity as well as profound friendship and partnership between our two peoples and two countries,"" he also said.Roque said inoculations could begin immediately by March 1 with personnel of the Philippine General Hospital to be the first to receive it.While the Food and Drug Administration has issued an Emergency Use Approval to Sinovac, the local regulator advised against using it on medical workers as it yielded a 50% efficacy rate in clinical trials involving hospital personnel in Brazil.Despite this, Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, PGH director, said hospital personnel have signed uo to receive the Sinovac vaccines.""Our basis for accepting this is the EUA given by the FDA, because we all know that if it gives clearance, the safety and efficacy are assured,"" he said, partly in Filipino.Last week, the PGH said 94% of their employees have registered to receive the vaccine, which was 75% higher than their initial survey in January. Dr. Jonas del Rosario, PGH spokesperson, said vaccination could start as soon as Monday. The recent days have seen experts stressing on the public to trust the FDA's standards in issuing emergency use approvals. This came amid uncertainties over Sinovac's efficacy rate, as well as survey results showing that only 19% of adult Filipinos are willing to be vaccinated.Findings by the OCTA Research team released on Wednesday showed that 46% of respondents said they would opt out of receiving vaccines, which was not far from the 47% in Pulse Asia's poll just last month.READ: Less than a fifth of adult Filipinos willing to get COVID-19 jabs — OCTALegaspi added: ""The important thing to remember here is whatever vaccine comes, we should welcome it because it will make a difference in controling the spread of this infection, and I think the first area where we should control it is in the hospital.""Health workers are at the top of government's priority list of sectors to be vaccinated.Apart from the 600,000 donated doses of Sinovac, the administration signed a term sheet with the manufacturer for 25 million more doses.Pfizer and AstraZeneca's vaccines from the COVAX facility were supposedly the first to arrive in the Philippines with officials touting an indicative date by mid-February. Palace officials have sought to play down the delays, with the president's lawyer even saying that a few more days of waiting would not matter.Just a few days before February ends, the Philippines has over 566,000 coronavirus cases with deaths at more than 12,000. The said count remains the second highest in Southeast Asia, and the more infectious COVID-19 variant is already in the country along with two mutations detected.Nothing final yet, yet againThe health department and the national task force on the pandemic on Thursday afternoon clarified that vaccination might not actually start by March 1 as the Palace claimed.In a joint statement, officials said ""specific details as to the allocation and subsequent rollout"" of the 600,000 doses are still being evaluated by the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and would need to be approved by the policy-setting IATF.While they also also confirmed that the vaccines would arrive in the coming days, details on the welcoming ceremony are also still being ironed out with the Chinese Embassy.The clarification hours after Roque's briefing was similar to how he said government would begin vaccinations by February 15, only later on to backtrack. Days later, the health department would also say that the given date was not definite.",Philstar

This was highly policitized despite the lack of conclusive evidence that the vaccine developed by French firm Sanofi Pasteur caused the deaths of children inoculated with it during the previous administration.Concerns about safety, efficacyThose who do not want to get COVID-19 jabs once available were particularly concerned about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.Seventy three percent cited concern about the safety of vaccines as their top reason for their decision not to get inoculated. Concern about vaccine safety was highest in Mindanao (78%), followed by Balance Luzon (76%), Metro Manila (69%) and Visayas (64%).Twenty-nine percent of the respondents also said they will not get vaccinated because they are not sure if vaccines are effective. Concern about vaccine effectiveness was highest in Visayas (46%), followed by Metro Manila (34%), Mindanao (27%) and Balance Luzon (21%).So far, three vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the country’s Food and Drug Administration—those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac.

But it is not an idea of the President. It is the idea of (Labor) Secretary (Silvestre) Bello (III) and (Foreign Affairs) Secretary (Teodoro) Locsin (Jr.) and we welcome it because more is better than less,” Roque said at a press briefing yesterday.The DOLE said the negotiation to secure vaccines from the UK and Germany is meant to protect the HCWs set for deployment abroad.“DOLE wishes to correct the sort of misquoted notion by some quarters about the intentions of sending or lifting of the cap in the number of nurses being requested by the UK and Germany. DOLE does not intend to treat our nurses as a commodity to be traded for vaccines,” DOLE information and public service director Rolly Francia said.Considering the generosity of the UK and German governments, Francia expressed DOLE’s belief that these countries would provide more vaccines for those they would hire and workers intending to seek employment abroad.The Department of Health (DOH) for its part said it was not consulted over a reported plan to trade off health workers for COVID-19 vaccines.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they were not even aware of such exchange between our “government and other governments for this matter.”“We think if there is such kind of negotiation, this should be presented to the Inter-Agency Task Force so the IATF could decide on this,” Vergeire said.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon scored the DOLE for the supposed barter plan of HCWs, saying the move is a sign of desperation.Drilon said the DOLE’s palit bakuna initiative is a wrong policy and sets a bad precedent.“For the government to go this far as trading off its Filipino health care workers in exchange for vaccines means something is not right in the government’s coronavirus vaccination strategy,” he said. –  Alexis Romero, Mayen Jaymalin, Sheila Crisostomo, Paolo Romero, Delon Porcalla",Philstar

It is not clear yet, though, what vaccine brand will be inoculated to them.VSMMC is one of the priorities in the vaccination program of the national government, it being a COVID-19 government hospital.The science behindAccording to the World Health Organization, vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with the body’s natural defenses to build protection. When a person gets a vaccine, his or her immune system responds.It recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria, and produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease.The immune system then remembers the disease and how to fight it. If the person is then exposed to the germ in the future, his or her immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.The vaccine, WHO says, is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness.""Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick,"" WHO adds. —  JMD (FREEMAN)",Philstar

He said he wanted to test the vaccine on himself because he was applying to be a local Sinopharm distributor.Related StoriesFDA approves compassionate use license on vaccines for PSG personnelMon Tulfo admits getting inoculated with smuggled Sinopharm shots, eyes local distributorshipThe columnist said he took the vaccine with some “Cabinet-level” officials, a senator and some members of the Presidential Security Group.The vaccine developed by a Chinese state-owned biotech firm has no authorization for emergency use in the Philippines. It has not even submitted application for such approval.FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the unauthorized vaccination activity will be referred to the agency’s regulatory enforcement unit for investigation.“We are investigating this because it is not good that we learn that there are individuals who get vaccinated without going through the right process,” Domingo said in a Laging Handa briefing Wednesday.In a separate briefing, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the ongoing probe into illegal vaccination activities will also include Tulfo.Agencies launched probes into the Presidential Security Group’s use of unregistered COVID-19 vaccines last year. Domingo said the FDA has yet to receive response from President Rodrigo Duterte’s security detail about their queries.The use of unregistered vaccines violates the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009, which prohibits the distribution and administering of vaccines not yet approved by regulatory authorities.The DOH and the FDA have been saying that the use of unregistered products poses harm to a person’s health and safety.Local distributorTulfo said he has applied to be a local distributor of Sinopharm with a company called “Apollo.” He said the firm supposedly secured a contract with a Singapore subsidiary of Sinopharm.He denied using his position as special envoy to apply for local distributorship and secure vaccine doses for himself, his drivers and his bodyguards.Vergeire said individuals who are supplying illegally procured COVID-19 shots will be investigated. “If there will be violations, there will be sanctions.”Conflict of interestIn a briefing, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque avoided commenting on whether or not there is conflict of interest in Tulfo’s application to be a local distributor of the  Sinopharm vaccine.“We have no opinion whatsoever.

If you want verification, please contact Mon Tulfo,” he also said. When asked if the Palace found the admission of unauthorized vaccination alarming, the presidential spokesperson replied: ""I don’t have any reaction to that because I understand that during a pandemic, many want to have protection. But we’re telling everybody to wait for the product to undergo the proper process.""Tulfo argued there is no conflict of interest because he is a “private citizen,” claiming he is “technically not a government official” because his position as special envoy is only “honorific.”In December last year, Duterte revealed that PSG members already got vaccinated against COVID-19 even if the FDA has yet to issue an EUA at the time. Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante, PSG commander, confirmed it, leaving health authorities surprised and the public enraged.The FDA eventually issued a “compassionate use license” for the president’s security detail to take 10,000 Sinopharm shots last February 11.Three vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the Philippines—Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac—but so far none have been delivered and the government is under criticism over the delayed vaccine rollout.",Philstar

The problem here is the supply of vaccines all over the world,” Go said.Barring any hitches, the government remains hopeful that the over 500,000 Sinovac vaccines from China will be arriving in the country three to five days after the FDA granted the EUA of the Chinese vaccine manufacturer.Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles made the announcement after the government missed its original schedule of arrival for the Sinovac vaccines yesterday.The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, along with the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, has been assured of the vaccines’ arrival shortly after the issuance of the EUA. – Sheila Crisostomo, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Michael Punongbayan",Philstar

The rating was only slightly higher than the World Health Organization's threshhold for deciding on vaccine use.Efficacies of same vaccine vary depending on test group This was backed by Dr. Rontgene Solante, an infectious diseases expert at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.Speaking to ONE News' ""The Chiefs"" on Monday night, he explained that vaccines have different efficacies depending on the group of individuals it was tested on. ""In this particular study (Brazil), they found out that the efficacy among these high-risk health workers is really low,"" he said. ""That's the beauty of a Phase 3 clinical trial, you will be able to know and look at [the] efficacy of the vaccines in different target population.""The clinical trials in Jakarta and Ankara involved volunteers from various fields, while the one in Brasilia was concentrated on medical personnel. Solante said the 50.4% efficacy was from a study focused on high-risk health workers who face different levels of exposure than regular people do.""If you are a frontliner and you are seeing patients... perhaps your risk could be at 50 to 60%,"" Solante said partly in Filipino. ""But if you are in the general population and not working in a hospital, your risk is really lower than that of health workers.""Hospital personnel are at the top of government's priority list to be vaccinated for the coronavirus, followed by senior citizens, the indigenous and marginalized as well as the police and military.Already, the Philippines is set to receive some 600,000 doses of Sinovac as a donation from Beijing, while the administration has signed a term sheet with the company for 25 million more doses.'Trust the experts'The arrival of other brands of vaccines, however, is facing significant delays particularly the 117,000 doses of Pfizer and 5.5 million of AstraZeneca from the COVAX facility.""We are placing our health workers and elderly people at further risk every day in the delay of the vaccine procurement,"" said Rep.

Sonny Angara called “regulatory barriers.”Among these is the provision which allows the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to buy COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies for its storage, transport and deployment through negotiated procurement instead of public bidding.It also allows local government units to buy COVID-19 vaccines through a tripartite agreement with the national government and the supplier of the shot. Private entities may also purchase their own vaccines through the same way.The bill also provides that COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies will be exempted from customs duties, value-added tax, excise tax, donor’s tax and other fees and charges.It also directs the DOH to issue a vaccine passport to all Filipinos which would contain basic personal information, the COVID-19 vaccine given to them, and the health facility where the shot was received.The bill initially suggested that those who have completed COVID-19 immunization may be granted perks, but this was dropped in the final measure.",Philstar

My understanding is there’s no requirement in the case of AstraZeneca for further exchange of letters between the manufacturer and the Philippines,” said Rabindra Abeyashinge, WHO country representative.The Philippines is expected to receive around 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine this year.“What we're looking at now is accelerating the delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines at least a part of the shipment to the Philippines,” he said. The WHO official also said the “impasse” between the Philippines and American vaccine manufacturer Pfizer on the delivery of much awaited COVID-19 shots may be resolved soon after the government received a side letter from the drugmaker. A side letter is a document used as a supplementary to a contract.“We believe that within the day today or tomorrow or whenever the legal teams have cleared those documents, we will see a resolution of that impasse and maybe there will be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe said.Three vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the Philippines—Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac—but so far none have been delivered and the government is under criticism over the delayed vaccine rollout.Officials said the delivery of 117,000 doses of vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech faced delays due to requirements such as indemnification.‘No link to Dengvaxia’Abeyasinghe also said the requirement of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers for the Philippines to submit indemnification agreements is not connected to the country’s experience with Dengvaxia.Last week, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said drugmakers were concerned with the country’s previous experiences with anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia. The government submitted indemnification agreements to access vaccine doses through the COVAX facility.But Abeyasinghe clarified that the “requirements and the standard agreements are common to all countries.”“They’re not specific to the Philippines and they’re not related to any issue that happened in the country relating to Dengvaxia or anything else,” Abeyasinghe said.“The indemnification clause is something manufacturers are demanding from every country irrespective of whether they are buying from manufacturers or whether they are receiving vaccines through the COVAX facility or some other mechanism,” he added.The controversy was highly politicized despite the lack of conclusive evidence that the vaccine developed by French firm Sanofi Pasteur caused the deaths of children inoculated with it during the previous administration.The fiasco also eroded public trust in life-saving vaccines. A survey of pollster Pulse Asia released last month showed nearly half of Filipinos would opt out of inoculation. — Gaea Katreena Cabico",Philstar

The HCWs, particularly nurses, are highly in demand in European countries due to the aging population.While DOLE is still waiting for feedback, Visperas is optimistic that the requests will be granted. The UK government, she said, is expected to send a response within the week.If the UK and Germany will agree to provide vaccines, DOLE will use them for OFWs who were displaced by the pandemic as well as those who will be going back abroad, she added.Visperas explained that Bello wanted to secure the vaccines for OFWs because vaccination is now becoming a common requirement for entering foreign migrants.Some Philippine Overseas Labor Offices (POLOs) reported that a number of destination countries for OFWs are no longer accepting migrants not vaccinated against COVID, she said.Based on DOLE data, over 570,000 OFWs were displaced by the pandemic, thus the need to secure at least 600,000 vaccines from UK and Germany.Meanwhile, the country’s discussions with Russia on the possible purchase of COVID-19 vaccines are now at a “very advanced stage,” said Manila’s envoy to Moscow Ambassador Carlos Sorreta.He noted that the vaccines would be acquired through a government-to-government commercial agreement and not through donation because the Duterte administration is ready to pay for the COVID-19 shots.“Our discussions on a technical level with Russia are in a very advanced stage. Right now, we are waiting for additional information, technical data being sought by the Philippines. Once it is obtained, I think that’s the final step for our FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to make a decision,” Sorreta said at a press briefing.“And once they make a decision, the Russian side is ready to sit down and sign, which they have done already with 30 countries, and there are 50 other counties lined up. So I think that’s the next step… If we make a decision soon and give the approval, I think the vaccines can come in a fairly quick amount of time,” he added.He noted that it is hard to give a timeline for the procurement but the Philippines is constantly following up on the information it is seeking from Russia.Russia has offered to supply the Philippines Sputnik V vaccines developed by Gamaleya Research Institute. Sorreta said the Russian vaccine is available commercially in that country and some Filipinos have availed themselves of it.“If you go to a private doctor, you can avail of it... Aside from medical centers in our areas, they set up vaccination facilities in the malls.

Beijing committed to donate 600,000 doses of the Chinese-made coronavirus jab, of which 100,000 will be allocated to military personnel. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Monday that the Chinese Embassy in Manila need three to five days to prepare the vaccine shipment once EUA is issued. The EUA will be valid only within the duration of the declared public health emergency or upon the issuance of certificate of product registration, which is the typical license issued to products. Not best vaccine for health workersThe authorization clears CoronaVac for use on “clinically healthy” individuals aged 18 and 59 years after it was found to have an efficacy rate of 65.3% in clinical trials held in Indonesia and 91.25% in the study conducted in Turkey. But late-stage trials in Brazil had shown an efficacy rate of 50.4%—just above the threshold the World Health Organization uses to decide if a vaccine is worth using. Brazil conducted trials with healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients only.""The use of Sinovac vaccine on healthcare workers is not recommended,"" Domingo said, explaining that CoronaVac is not the most ideal vaccine to administer to medical frontliners because of their constant exposure to the virus.Medical frontliners are at the top of the government's priority list for COVID-19 vaccination.

The possibility of allergy and severe allergy or anaphylaxis is minimal,” the FDA chief said in a mix of English and Filipino. Unlike competitor vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, Sinovac has yet to submit Phase 3 clinical trial data to medical journals for peer review. The AstraZeneca shot was found to be 70% effective on average. Meanwhile, COVID-19 jabs from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna reported 95% and 94.1% efficacy rates, respectively. Sinovac shots can be stored at around 2°C, which is the standard temperature that is within the existing cold chain system in the country.The Philippine government earlier signed a term sheet with the Chinese drugmaker for 25 million doses of its vaccine. It is aiming to secure a total of 146 to 148 million vaccine doses to inoculate at least 50 million people this year alone, but it has yet to execute definitive supply agreements with pharmaceutical companies. — with a report from Agence France-Presse",Philstar

Not necessarily, says expert","MANILA, Philippines — Vaccines for COVID-19 do not necessarily prevent infection and transmission of the virus but it could protect those inoculated against severe illness, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday night.Enrique Tayag, DOH director for Knowledge Management and IT Service, explained that clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines are not yet finished but these were released by manufacturers through an emergency use authorization (EUA) issued by regulatory authorities of countries.This means that people can still get infected although “there will be no severe COVID-19,” he said in an interview with The Chiefs on Cignal TV’s OneNews.“(From) what we know...it proves that it protects against severe COVID-19 and prevents hospitalization,” the former DOH chief epidemiologist added in reference to the case of a 43-year-old overseas Filipino worker in Mandaue City in Cebu.The OFW had two doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine while still in the United Arab Emirates. He went though a 14-day quarantine after arriving in Cebu. However, when tested before flying back to the UAE, he turned positive for the virus.Four of his household members were also found infected, although it could not be ascertained if they got the virus from him.Tayag said that “timing is important for vaccination” as a person could already be “incubating” the infection when vaccinated. He also underscored the need to get the complete two shots to acquire maximum protection.A 24-year-old OFW from Canada also tested positive for COVID-19 after arriving in Cebu last Feb. 9. She was swab tested on Feb. 14, the fifth day of her quarantine, and found positive. It turned out that she was given her first dose of Pfizer vaccine last Jan. 13 in Canada but failed to get the second dose.Meanwhile, the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is targeting to inoculate close to 1,000 health care personnel and non-medical workers per day once the vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech arrives.Hospital director Gerardo Legaspi said that, based on their simulation, they could give shots to 975 individuals per day.“If we want to vaccinate 975 people – because one tray per day – we will need nine vaccinators and 54 monitoring (seats),” he said at a recent briefing organized by the Department of Health.Based on pre-registration, at least 94.1 percent or 5,745 of the 6,316 workers PGH workers have signed up for vaccination. These are composed of health workers, non-medical personnel, student-interns and consultants, among others, regardless of employment status.According to Legaspi, the simulation revealed they could inoculate six people per vial with the “saline solution” they are using. However, to get six doses from one vial, they would have to use “low-dead space syringes.”The PGH, he said, is having difficulty in finding a supplier for this syringe type.He also foresees a “big bottleneck” in the screening procedures and recommended that the DOH allow them to forego blood pressure screening for those who are not hypertensive.“Taking BP and pulse takes time. If they are not hypertensive to begin with, maybe we can (do away with it),” Legaspi explained.He noted that their registration activities allowed them to know the quantity of vaccines needed and to do “eligibility checks.”",Philstar

It is also possible for one of the chambers to simply adopt the other house’s version.The arrival of doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccines from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility was delayed due to the need for an indemnity program that provides that the government, and not the manufacturers, would be held liable for adverse effects due to the shots.Senators on Wednesday said that if they had been informed of the need for an indemnity fund sooner, they would have addressed it. Galvez, for his part, has said that this requirement was only recently raised by the COVAX facility and other suppliers.The Philippines is among the laggards in Southeast Asia in terms of coronavirus vaccinations, with the country yet to finalize a single supply agreement for the coveted shots and yet to receive a single dose.This, despite the country having the second-worst outbreak of COVID-19 in the region, with over 555,500 cases and over 11,000 deaths. — with a report from Bella Perez-Rubio",Philstar

Yet progress on vaccinations has been wildly uneven and unfair,” Guterres said.“The world urgently needs a Global Vaccination Plan to bring together all those with the required power, expertise and production capacities,” he said.The UN and partners have established the COVAX Facility to ensure countries would have access to vaccines, regardless of their wealth. The UN official said the mechanism must be fully funded.Guterres proposed that the world’s richest countries, the G20 nations, form an Emergency Task Force to prepare a plan and coordinate its implementation and financing.With UN support, the task force should work to mobilize pharmaceutical companies and key industry and logistics actors, he said.The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is assisting countries in preparation for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, aiming to procure two billion doses by the end of the year.“This historic effort deserves historic support,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF executive director. “Help us ensure that the light at the end of the tunnel shines on us all — including the families and communities enduring the horrors of conflict.”Fore underscored UN Security Council’s support is necessary for getting countries to ensure that all people are included in national vaccination plans, regardless of their status or even if they live in areas not under government control.",Philstar

Last evening, I was made to understand that this may happen within the next two weeks,” Abeyasinghe said during the Laging Handa public briefing yesterday.While he noted that Pfizer has not sent out indemnification agreement yet to any of the countries that are eligible for the vaccination rollout, he gave assurance that the COVAX facility is working closely with the firm to make sure that it sends this out—the last step waiting to be accomplished for the delivery of vaccines.On top of the vaccines arriving in the next two weeks, Abeyasinghe said, another shipment of vaccines may also be delivered by late March or early April.He further reported that additional AstraZeneca vaccines are ready for possible shipment to the Philippines if all requirements are complied with.“What I said is that there is a quantity of vaccine that have been readied for shipment. They are not earmarked for the Philippines. But if the Philippines can meet the requirements that are necessary, maybe we will be able to access these vaccines too,” Abeyasinghe said.He added that WHO is also looking to grant Emergency Use Listing, which opens the way for the delivery of vaccines, to several other potential COVID vaccines.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stressed that due to limited global supply, Filipinos don’t have the luxury of choosing which brand they would be vaccinated with.In a television interview, FDA director general Eric Domingo said pharmaceutical firms are only capable of supplying a certain amount of vaccines to the Philippines.“There is no single vaccine company that will be able to supply all our requirements. For example, Pfizer; it can only deliver a few million this 2021. So, this means that we would have to source 20 to 30 million somewhere from the vaccines that will be approved by the FDA,” he pointed in Filipino.At the House committee on people’s participation hearing yesterday, Domingo revealed that Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, which manufactures the Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19, has not yet secured an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the country due to incomplete requirements.He said the FDA has already sought the assistance of the Russian embassy here to expedite the processing of EUA application.So far, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have secured EUAs from the FDA. The Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac also has not secured the required authorization yet.“We need some documents of course to be attested to by the manufacturer and we know the manufacturer is in Russia and it’s very difficult for some documents to go there and get here,” Domingo told members of the House panel.He added that Gamaleya also needs to submit a good manufacturing practice (GMP) certification, which is required to “assure the consistency of the quality of the product.”Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon lamented that the Philippines is still scrambling to secure supplies when six out of 10 countries in Southeast Asia have already begun their vaccination programs.He cited Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar as among the countries that have started rolling out the jabs, which left the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Thailand behind.“Many are baffled by our situation. Out of the 10 countries in Southeast Asia, six have already started inoculating their citizens,” Drilon said during a Senate session Wednesday. “Why is it that we still do not have the vaccination until now?”Drilon said the government targets to inoculate at least 70 million Filipinos to achieve herd immunity but has not signed any supply agreement for COVID-19 vaccines yet.“I cannot emphasize this enough: our survival as a nation largely depends on our ability to ensure immediate access and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to our people. At the rate things are going, however, Filipinos have to wait longer,” he added.He reiterated that apart from Filipinos’ lack of confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, politics poses a challenge to the government’s mass vaccination program against coronavirus. — Cecille Suerte Felipe, Alexis Romero",Philstar

It’s quick, usually the inspection only takes three days,” Domingo said in a mix of English and Filipino.For its part, the Russian Embassy assured that it would assist the Philippine team who would go to Russia to inspect the vaccine’s factory.“In this case, I suppose, we will give full visa assistance. We will issue visas as soon as possible,” Vladislav Mongush, the embassy's first secretary, said.Another crucial document lacking for the speedy approval of Sputnik V for emergency use is an authorization from its manufacturer that would allow Philippine Archipelago International Trading Corp. to sign documents on their behalf.Domingo said it would be “a lot faster” if the vaccine’s local distributor would be able to sign documents on their behalf.“We need some documents, of course, to be attested to by the manufacturer, and we know the manufacturer is in Russia and it’s very difficult for some documents to go there and then get here,” he said.Domingo also said that vaccine experts are still “fine-tuning” their recommendations on the safety and efficacy of Sputnik V, particularly on whether it would be effective for Filipinos as it uses a modified virus to deliver instructions to cells.He said the Department of Science and Technology is conducting a study whether many Filipinos have already been infected with adenovirus-5, the viral vector used in Sputnik V, which he said may potentially lessen the efficacy of the vaccine.He also said that the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which developed the vaccine, submitted Thursday more documents to support their application for emergency use authorization (EUA) and that regulatory officers are currently checking these.Gamaleya applied last January 6 for an EUA for Sputnik V, which, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal is 91.6% effective.Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer of the Russian Direct Investment Fund which bankrolled Sputnik V, previously said that Russia is ready to supply COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines as soon as it secures an EUA.",Philstar

We have never hit this number of people ever since we’ve launched the ‘A Dose of Hope,’ so that shows that everybody here is eager to get out of this pandemic,” Concepcion noted.“I’m glad that with our discussion with Kishore of Faberco, he has appointed Unilab to handle the private sector orders, while they handle the LGU and national government orders,” he said.Unilab has set the minimum order at 200 doses with an option for smaller companies to consolidate among themselves, making it more accessible especially for MSMEs.“Now, our role here is to support Unilab in its efforts to get orders. We will endorse all orders to Unilab, our staff will take down the orders and help follow through on any issues with them. That is the role that the Go Negosyo’s A Dose of Hope will be playing in this program with Faberco and Unilab – use our experience in the initial program with AstraZeneca to really make the Novavax vaccine accessible to as many private sectors who need it, especially our MSMEs,” Concepcion added.The collaboration is intended to help the workforce, the most valuable asset of companies, and to find solutions to protect them against COVID-19.He said safeguarding the health of the people through vaccination is highly encouraged.“This is how we could show gratitude to our everyday heroes. Together with Unilab, your trusted quality health care partner, we will bring Covovax to the private sector to help our economy get back up,” said Kishore Hemlani, founder of Faberco Life Sciences Inc.At the briefing, Unilab was represented by Jose Maria Ochave, SVP for social partnerships of Unilab, with Dr. Nancy Bernal, medical director of Unilab, and Manolet Montinola, VP of Unilab.“Bayanihan has always been a cornerstone of our policies. It has always been with us. So, we thought that this is a good vaccine and in the spirit of Bayanihan, we said, why don’t we offer it to the rest, and fortunately, Faberco said yes. They can take care of the government sector and we can take care of the private sector. We’re a 100 percent Filipino-owned company, we sink and we swim with the country,” Ochave said.Bernal presented the Covovax efficacy and safety profile, efficacy set at 89.3 percent with no severe adverse effect, and Montinola presented the particulars of the partnership, including its objectives, dosage and administration, age indication, supply chain management with focus on transport and storage, the projected date of supply which is on the third quarter of 2021 and the partnership terms with private sectors that will procure through Unilab.The indicative cost for the vaccine is currently set at P1,000 per dose, exclusive of VAT, inclusive of logistics and delivery nationwide to Department of Health-approved vaccination hospital/site. This is not including the cost of administering the vaccine, which depends on the hospital or site where the vaccination will be administered – a hospital or site of choice of the private company that procured the vaccine, as long as the hospital or site is DOH-accredited.Orders to Unilab also extend to family members of each employee, given that the administration still follows the government’s prioritization.",Philstar

If a bill is certified by the President as urgent, it may be passed by Congress on second and third reading on the same day.Currently, local governments can only buy COVID-19 shots through a tripartite agreement with the national government and suppliers. Roque previously said the procurement law has to be amended to allow local governments to pay in advance.He has also assured the public that the national government is prepared to buy vaccines for everyone even if some local governments are procuring their own COVID-19 doses.Despite the delay in the delivery of Pfizer vaccines, the government remains optimistic that the vaccination program would start within the month.“The timetable will remain. Our timetable is (to inoculate) 50 to 70 million (Filipinos) within the year,” Roque said.“With regard to Sinovac, we are still hopeful that the delay is only about one week; but in any case, there is a written letter from no less than the COVAX Facility saying that delivery will be in mid-February,” he added.Roque said vaccines produced by Chinese drug maker Sinovac are expected to arrive on Feb. 23. It is also possible for the Pfizer vaccines purchased through the COVAX facility to arrive before Feb. 23, he added.“We cannot tell with precision when the vaccines purchased through the COVAX Facility would arrive but for sure, we can start within the month of February. If it’s not Valentines, well belated Kung Hei Fat Choi,” he added, using the Chinese new year greeting.Asked what is holding up the signing of an actual agreement for the purchase of vaccines, Roque said the term sheet is also a “perfected contract.”“It is also a perfected contract because the consent, object and consideration are complete... We are just waiting for the contract of sale,” he said.League of Cities’ appealMore than a hundred LGUs are asking President Duterte to issue an executive order authorizing the advance payment for COVID-19 vaccines they are set to procure for their residents.In a resolution dated Feb. 4, 114 member-cities of the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) said the advance payments for tripartite agreements they signed for vaccine acquisition are due on Feb. 24.Citing Presidential Decree 1445, the local executives’ body said “cities need an express authorization and issuance from President Duterte such as an executive order allowing them to procure vaccines and proceed with the required advance payment market provisions in their respective agreements with the pharmaceutical companies.”“LCP members seek the urgent action of the Office of the President to issue the necessary executive order at the soonest possible time,” the resolution read.The resolution did not mention which cities were asking for the executive order, but it did say that the cities in question had inked tripartite agreements with AstraZeneca under the A Dose of Hope Program last Jan. 14.Copies of the resolution have been sent to several offices including the Office of the Executive Secretary, Department of Budget and Management, Commission on Audit, Department of Health, Department of the Interior and Local Government, National Task Force against COVID-19 and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).Tax reliefIn their plea, the LGUs have found support from the House committee on ways and means which approved yesterday the tax provision of a bill that seeks to authorize them to directly purchase COVID-19 vaccines from pharmaceutical companies.The panel stamped its approval on Section 6 of House Bill 8648 (Emergency Vaccine Procurement Act of 2021) that provides tax exemptions for the procurement, importation, storage, transport, distribution and administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by LGUs.These vaccines would be exempted from customs duties, value-added tax, excise tax and other fees, provided the shots to be acquired by LGUs “shall only be used for their residents and constituents and not for commercial distribution.”Last week, the panel headed by Albay Rep. Joey Salceda also approved HB 8648, which generally seeks to expedite the purchase and administration of vaccines by allowing LGUs to directly purchase from foreign manufacturers.Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, who authored the bill, said this mechanism would ensure that vaccines are “procured and administered in an expeditious, effective, efficient and equitable manner.”“The next crucible in the fight against the pandemic is the speedy procurement and effective administration of vaccines against the deadly disease,” the Marinduque congressman said.“Time is of the essence. Each day of delay is very costly for the government and leaves many of our vulnerable countrymen exposed to the dangers of this disease.”Camarines Sur Rep. LRay Villafuerte called on officials of the vaccination program to focus on fast-tracking the training of personnel at the LGU level in the proper storage, handling and administration of the temperature-sensitive vaccine doses.“In CamSur, we already have a list of the priority beneficiaries across the province as well as the list of frontliners who are to administer the vaccines,” Villafuerte said.He said this will avoid wastage and keep the government on track in its target of immunizing 70 million Filipino adults by yearend.“Our frontliners need to be properly trained on how to administer the shots. LGU staff should also be trained on the proper storage of the meds. Another thing is that there are certain municipalities that have no adequate cold storage facilities to keep the vaccines,” he pointed out.“Based on reports, the government plans to start the vaccination program once the vaccines from the COVAX Facility arrive. Frontline health care workers caring for patients in high-risk areas will be given top priority in the initial rollout,” the Bicolano congressman said.Pfizer doses for 34 hospitalsThirty-four hospitals will receive the initial batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that the Philippines will acquire through the COVAX Facility, the DOH said yesterday.Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said 32 of the hospitals “eligible to receive the vaccines” are in the National Capital Region and two are in Davao and in Cebu.“We had a meeting with them last Friday,” she told a press conference. These hospitals will receive initially 117,000 doses that are expected to arrive this month from the COVAX Facility of the World Health Organization.These doses will primarily be given to medical and non-medical workers in these hospitals.Vergeire added the hospitals were directed to submit to DOH their “verified list of vaccinees plus their quick substitution list (QSL).”“As of today, most of our hospitals were already able to submit their complete lists. There are just some hospitals that are still completing their QSLs,” she said.One of the hospitals that will receive the vaccines is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) which is readying its QSL to prevent vaccine wastage.PGH director Gerardo Legaspi said the vaccination program got “overwhelming support” from some 6,000 PGH workers, as 94 percent of them have signed up to be inoculated.This is higher than the 74 percent acceptance rate posted by the workers in a survey done a month ago.Legaspi admitted the increase in vaccine confidence can be due to the knowledge that the vaccine that will arrive first in the country is from Pfizer.However, the delivery of the Pfizer vaccines has been delayed from the initial target of Feb. 15.He added there are enough alternative vaccinees in case some of those who registered back out.Vergeire said the one-week delay in the delivery of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines has given the government enough time to fine-tune the vaccine rollout. – Delon Porcalla, Sheila Crisostomo, Rudy Santos",Philstar

Anything that would assure them that there is nothing to worry about and in the event of untoward side effects they are protected,” Robredo said in her program over dzXL on Sunday.Sen. Nancy Binay has filed Senate Bill 2015, seeking to establish a vaccine indemnification fund to boost public confidence in the efficacy of the vaccines and compensate those who would suffer adverse side effects.Robredo also said she believes health experts should educate the public regarding the importance of immunization against COVID-19.“To me, it will add to the confidence of the people if many health experts will talk about the vaccines and will be interviewed,” she said. “It boosts the confidence of the public when they hear it from the doctors, whom they trust, that there is nothing to fear.”Some 5,640 health workers and non-medical personnel out of 6,000 of the Philippine General Hospital have registered for the COVID-19 vaccination, according to PGH spokesman Jonas del Rosario.Del Rosario, who recovered from COVID-19 last year, will be the first person to receive the COVID-19 shot.“This is symbolic, very meaningful, because if we recall Dr. Jonas caught COVID-19. He lost his parents due to COVID-19,” Robredo said.PGH is one of four COVID-19 referral hospitals prioritized for vaccine distribution. The others are the Lung Center of the Philippines and East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City and Dr. Jose Natalio Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center in Caloocan City.They are expected to receive part of the 117,000 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from the COVAX Facility, a global vaccine-sharing program.",Philstar

The collective goal for both the private sector and government is to vaccinate as many people as possible at the soonest possible time,” Guillermo Luz, chief resilience officer of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation, a T3 member, said in a statement.Luz said that these initial vaccine doses have been earmarked by the national government for priority sectors led by health care professionals and senior citizens.“Our medical frontliners have been tirelessly protecting and treating Filipinos from the beginning of the pandemic and we support the government’s prioritization of health care workers in receiving the initial vaccine doses,” Paolo Borromeo, CEO of AC Health, another T3 member, added.For the vaccination rollout, Taskforce T3, in partnership with the Department of Health and the National Task Force (NTF) against COVID-19, is developing a vaccine education campaign to inform citizens about vaccine safety and efficacy.T3 is also providing technical support on vaccine administration and cold-chain logistics for the transit of temperature-controlled vaccine vials.All these efforts of Taskforce T3 are on top of the vaccine doses donated by the private sector to the national government part of the procurement by the private sector for its economic and essential frontliners.The private sector procurement is intended to augment the supply purchased by the national government and the vaccines secured from the COVAX facility.“A successful vaccination rollout is crucial to our country’s efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and support our ultimate goal to protect lives and provide livelihood. The private sector is unwavering in its commitment to assist the national government by providing resources and expertise to ensure the success of its vaccination program,” Joey Concepcion, founder of Go Negosyo and presidential adviser for entrepreneurship, said.Taskforce T3 was formed in April 2020 to work closely with the NTF to manage the outbreak of the pandemic.Last October the group launched the “Ingat Angat Tayong Lahat” campaign, which aimed to build consumer confidence and encourage Filipinos to once again enjoy activities outside the confines of their homes to help rebuild the economy and protect jobs – as long as strict safety guidelines and protocols are followed.",Philstar

It is unclear if Duterte is willing to get the Chinese-made vaccines.About 500,000 doses of Chinese firm Sinovac’s vaccines are expected to arrive in the Philippines on Feb. 23. The jabs could arrive ahead of the 117,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that the country will initially get under the COVAX Facility of the World Health Organization.Duterte arrived in Davao City over the weekend for a number of engagements. He is staying here also for the birthday of his partner Cielito Avanceña today.The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases also scheduled its weekly meeting at the Arcadia Activity Center last night.Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the President changed his mind about being vaccinated in public to encourage more Filipinos to avail themselves of the vaccination program against the COVID-19 pandemic.At 75, the President belongs to the seniors’ priority group.“He only has to announce when it will be done and that’s of course in recognition of the fact that the people are waiting for a sign whether or not to get themselves vaccinated,” Roque added in mixed English and Filipino.“The President has said, ‘OK, if you want me to,’ and there’s public clamor, he said he will,” the Palace spokesman said. A Pulse Asia poll conducted from Nov. 23 to Dec. 2 last year found 47 percent of Filipinos saying they won’t get COVID-19 jabs mainly because of safety concerns. Only 32 percent of the respondents were willing to be vaccinated while 21 percent were undecided.The President will be vaccinated in public as long as his doctors allow him, Roque said, unlike last month when he said Duterte wanted it done in private.The chief of the Philippine Navy, meanwhile, is also willing to be inoculated in public to show fellow soldiers and everybody else that there is nothing to be concerned about regardless of what vaccine brand will be used.“I am willing to make my inoculation public to allay fears of our countrymen with COVID-19 vaccines,” Vice Admiral Giovanni Carlo Bacordo said. “By making public my vaccination, I believe that I can help the national government build confidence and ease the general public’s hesitancy with COVID-19 vaccines.”“What’s important are its benefits to help mitigate the effect of this pandemic.

Still, Leonila said it must be reconciled with the version in the House. ""We have to make sure they agree on this common statement, that they will remove the direct purchase with the pharmaceutical company and involve the central government,"" she said.The two stressed the crucial role that local governments will play in the vaccination rollout, which they said would be half of the entire immunization program.This will include hiring and training people for the vaccination as well as ensuring accuracy in LGUs' enrollment list and putting it in a databse.

We thank the British government for its support in our vaccination program, helping vaccinate eight to nine million Filipinos in the first half of 2021,” said vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.A World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel dismissed concerns over the efficacy of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID vaccine on Wednesday, insisting that “it’s the right thing to do” to use it – even in countries where new variants had surfaced.WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan has urged countries to use AstraZeneca vaccine, saying there’s no time for hesitation.Australia has expressed its readiness to support the Philippines and its partners in the Indo-Pacific region to ensure an equitable and efficient distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.Australian Ambassador Steven Robinson said on Twitter that he met recently with Galvez, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and National Action Plan deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon to ask for an update on the vaccine rollout.He said Australia also wanted to know from the Philippine officials how it could support the distribution through the COVAX facility.The European Union has also assured the Philippines of “fair access” to affordable COVID-19 vaccines.President Duterte earlier accused the EU of holding up supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to other countries.New Ambassador Luc Véron said the EU is eager to pursue the effective implementation of its Partnership and Cooperation agreement with the Philippines.“The EU and its member states will continue their efforts to contribute to the international response to the pandemic, including by guaranteeing affordable and fair access to vaccines for all,” Véron said following the presentation of his credentials to Duterte on Wednesday.The EU, he said, at all times through its humanitarian aid and civil protection stands prepared to support the Philippines in cases of natural emergencies, and in ensuring disaster preparedness.“For all these reasons, the EU is willing to have a productive political relationship with the Philippine government, notably to support the Philippines in its efforts to overcome the COVID-19 crisis and its efforts to restart its economy,” he added.He noted that the EU has a strategic interest in a stable, prosperous and secure Philippines. This could be achieved by furthering trade and investment, promoting maritime security and maintaining open and safe shipping routes.Since 2014, the EU has been providing the Philippines with preferential trade access to the EU market, based on sustainable development principles, good governance and human rights.“The EU with its business community is also the first foreign investor in the Philippines,” he said.Belgium, for its part, said it will make sure companies that will export COVID-19 vaccine will fulfill their contractual obligations to ensure uninterrupted distribution.“The Belgian Government takes pride in the fact that Belgium is the home of the production facilities of some of the world’s most renowned pharmaceutical companies and will spare no effort to ensure that within the framework of this new procedure, these companies will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations towards third countries and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will not be interrupted,” Belgium’s Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation said.Belgian authorities are in constant communication with suppliers Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson regarding streamlining of procedures.According to the European Commission, the country where the final manufacturing and handling of the vaccine are done before shipment to destination, is responsible for granting export license.“As such, Belgium is responsible for granting export licenses for COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and soon also Johnson & Johnson.

But definitely, it will be in February,” Galvez said when asked by Sen. Francis Pangilinan on the new dates of vaccine rollout.Sinovac is not a part of the COVAX Facility, a global risk-sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines led by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, among others.Galvez said some 600,000 Sinovac Biotech Ltd. coronavirus vaccine doses will arrive this month.“The arrival of the Sinovac might be at the definite date of Feb. 23 because they will include donations for the military and for our health workers,” the vaccine czar added.The finance committee chaired by Sen. Sonny Angara tackled Senate Bill 2042 or Expediting the Purchase and Administration of Vaccines amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Galvez pointed out that the delivery of vaccines is affected by different factors including the approval of EUA as well as supplies.Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto said a vaccine should not be demonized because of where it was manufactured.“We should not demonize a vaccine because of its country of origin. Let science be the guide, not superstition,” Recto said. “If our scientists from UP (University of the Philippines) and the FDA will say after a thorough evaluation that it is good, then who are we to doubt their findings? Science is the light that will lead us out of pandemic darkness.”“Knee-jerk reaction against anything made in China does not help in the fight against Covid-19. And any doubt on any vaccine in particular fuels vaccine hesitancy in general,” he added.Sen. Imee Marcos said they have been receiving a great number of complaints from Russia’s Gamaleya and Sinopharm, whose vaccines’ EUA are all pending approval.FDA director-general Eric Domingo said the foreign vaccine manufacturers have no local representatives, and there is also a problem with compliance of documents.“This is the mess. We do not know who their local representative is,” Domingo said.HesitancySome police officials are hesitant to be inoculated with coronavirus vaccines from China and will only do so if instructed by the national government.The officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they will look at the vaccines of other pharmaceutical companies especially if the recipients will be their families.President Duterte wants a portion of the donated COVID-19 vaccines from China’s Sinovac to be allocated to the police and military.One of them, a police official assigned in Camp Crame, said he will pass on China-made vaccines even if he would lose his slot and would rather wait for the brands from other pharmaceutical firms.Asked for the reason, the police officer said he would rather have the medicines from other reputable companies such as Pfizer and Moderna of the United States and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca.Another police official based in Central Luzon, meanwhile, said he will take the made in China vaccine if there is a directive from higher headquarters in Camp Crame.“As police officers, we were instructed to comply first before complaining,” he said in a phone interview.However, the situation is different when it comes to his wife and children, saying he would rather procure vaccines from other companies.This was the same sentiment of a female police commander in Metro Manila, stressing she will never let her children take the Sinovac vaccine CoronaVac.A police general, however, said he is willing to be inoculated with the vaccine from China despite his apprehension, adding it is better to take the risk than not getting vaccinated at all.Philippine National Police PNP) chief Gen. Debold Sinas refused to comment when asked if he is willing to be inoculated with the vaccine from Sinovac.Sinas did not reply when asked if he would prefer to be vaccinated in public to boost the government’s campaign to convince people to get the jabs purchased by the national government.Meanwhile, the delivery of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine from the World Health Organization’s COVAX facility has apparently hit a snag.National Task Force deputy chief Vince Dizon said in a Palace briefing that there are some delays in the vaccine arrival from the COVAX facility due to documentary issues.But Dizon said he remains optimistic the delivery will be made within the month.Allergic reactionsMedical experts yesterday warned against getting second dose of COVID vaccine for those who would suffer from allergic reactions in the initial shot.The Philippine Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (PSSAAI), however, maintained that there is no reason for the public to worry and that COVID vaccine is safe to most people.The PSSAAI noted that the risk of getting COVID infection is higher than the risk of suffering from allergic reaction from vaccination.“Severe allergic reaction is rare and the usual mild allergic reaction such as rashes, itchiness, running nose and sneezing can be managed with antihistamine,” immunology and allergy doctor Maria Carmen Ang said in a virtual briefing yesterday.Ang said vaccines may cause side effects to a person, but not all of them are allergic reactions.“Some side effects are reactogenic and it is not the same as allergic,” she said, and that among the local or reactogenic reactions are pain, swelling and redness in the injection.She said those mild reactions, including vomiting, headache, muscle pain and fever, would go away within three days and can be managed with pain reliever.Only those who would have immediate allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis and those with allergy to the components of vaccine are strongly advised against getting vaccinated, she said.“The only contraindication are for patients with immediate allergic reaction whether mild or severe after the first dose should not receive the second dose and those with history of any component of the vaccine should not receive as well,” Ang stressed.She said those with allergy to food and other allergens as well as those with asthma, allergic rhinitis can still receive the vaccine.PSSAAI president Rommel Lobo said there has been no confirmed death related to COVID vaccine.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the added protection of COVID-19 vaccine will bring the Philippines one step closer to resuming a more normal life. – Emmanuel Tupas, Christina Mendez, Mayen Jaymalin",Philstar

Many cities have already signed agreements with those manufacturers.""Following the advance payment of supply of vaccines, the foreign manufacturer, in consideration of its agreement with the concerned LGU, shall undertake to deliver the supply of vaccines within six months from the perfection of the contract,"" the House bill added.The said measure would provide compensation, through an indemnification fund, for individuals who would be vaccinated and have adverse reactions. It would also exempt the LGU's efforts from import duties, taxes and other fees, ""provided that the vaccines acquired shall only be used for their residents and constituents"" and not for commercial distribution.Further, it states that ""the availment of the advance payment mechanism"" would not be an exemption from the Commission on Audit's post-transaction audit, saying the body would have to submit its report to both chambers.In a statement, however, a group of medical professionals said they were opposed to such measures, warning that constituents of cities and provinces with better resources could edge out those on the government's priority list.""Mag-uunahang makabili ang may pera, maimpluwensya, at makapangyarihan,"" said the Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19. ""Maaaring mahuli na ang mga frontliner, matatanda, at may mga ibang sakit - ang mga tunay na kailangang mauna sa bakuna dahil sa mataas na peligro sa kanilang buhay.""(Those with money, influence and power would be scrambling to get the vaccines first.

Junie Cua (Quirino), also contains a provision tasking the interior secretary, along with the Government Procurement Policy Board, to come up with special procurement rules if the bill is enacted into law.And while both had hurdled the appropriations committee, it would still be subject to amendments. Should it be enacted, it will only remain in effect during the state of calamity and public health emergency due to the pandemic.President Rodrigo Duterte in January allowed for local governments to enter into tripartite agreements with the national government and vaccine manufacturers if they would want to secure doses for their own constituents.By mid-January, 28 LGUs have either signed deals or announced funding for AstraZeneca's doses, including Duterte's hometown Davao City, with none opting for the Chinese-made Sinovac which the administration had been criticized for its seeming preference for the jabs. — with reports from Xave Gregorio",Philstar

Ports have already activated one-stop shops to handle vaccine shipments,” Guerrero said when asked if the BOC is prepared to accept COVID-19 vaccines. “We will use pre-arrival clearance procedures for COVID-19 vaccine shipments so that they can be expeditiously released upon arrival at the airport.”The BOC acknowledges the importance to swiftly release the vaccines so that their efficacy will not be affected, according to Guerrero.The BOC and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) conducted a dry run last Tuesday to practice how to process the vaccines.Guerrero said the simulation exercise went smoothly: “It went very well. Customs clearance was very fast as the shipment was already processed prior to its arrival.”Asked if they have received information on the arrival of the vaccines, the BOC commissioner said they do not know yet, but he assured the public that the bureau is ready once they arrive.Guerrero also emphasized that BOC personnel would not be allowed to physically handle the vaccines.‘Secure, escort vaccines’From arrival to delivery to actual inoculation, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP) to secure and escort COVID-19 vaccines in the country to their intended destinations for rollout.DILG officer-in-charge Undersecretary Bernardo Florece said police should be present and coordinate with local government units (LGUs) to secure and protect the vaccines during transport and administration.“We direct the PNP to be in close coordination with LGUs so that these vaccines are secured and protected. From their arrival at the airport to inoculation, our police force will be there,” Florece said in a statement in mixed English and Filipino.Being part of the Task Group Supply Chain and Logistics, the PNP will be present to secure and protect the vaccines and the team that will be administering the inoculation.Aside from police, local officials such as barangay captains, local safety officers and barangay tanods should aid in the vaccination, according to Florece.“Like what we’ve always been reminding, we need all the help that we can get in this pandemic, especially in the vaccine rollout in the country, that’s why the PNP, together with barangay chiefs and tanods, is expected to assist and cooperate,” he said.The national government is looking at commencing the massive COVID-19 vaccination drive by next week, starting with frontline health care workers.An initial batch of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are expected to be rolled out by Monday.As this developed, the DILG criticized the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) for laying down conditions before they can grant President Duterte’s request to not hamper the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines nationwide.The CPP had earlier said it would provide a “humanitarian corridor,” but the government should refrain from using military vehicles in transporting the vaccines and that these vehicles should be properly marked.DILG spokesman Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said the CPP is threatening the delivery of vaccines in conflict-affected areas by laying down demands on the government.Malaya added the PNP is on high alert because of the conditions set by the communist group.‘Caduceus’All security measures are in place to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, the PNP said yesterday.“All systems are in place to ensure the unhampered transport of the vaccine shipment to storage facilities and distribution hubs,” PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said in a statement.Sinas said they have drawn up a strategic plan that will operationalize all security and public safety operations for the transport of vaccines in the coming weeks and months.Under the PNP’s Vaccination Plan “Caduceus,” police have put in place security and public safety guidelines as well as procedures in support of the national government’s vaccination program.PNP deputy chief for operations Lt. Gen. Cesar Binag, overall supervisor of the security program, said police regional officers will provide security assistance in the transport of vaccine shipments from storage hubs to vaccination centers.The PNP will also establish police assistance at vaccination centers to deter rebel groups such as the New People’s Army from carrying out attacks.At least 2,705 members of the PNP’s medical reserve force will also help health care workers in administering the vaccines to designated recipients.Binag said police units across the country have mapped out their respective security plans so that COVID-19 vaccines purchased by the national government will reach their intended recipients.He added that local police units have conducted simulation drills for the transportation of the vaccines from the airport and seaports to designated cold storage facilities.Backup plans have also been formulated in the event that delivery trucks get stalled or meet an accident, according to the police official, explaining that this is necessary so that the vaccines are kept safe and transported immediately to storage areas.The PNP has also identified areas where the presence of communist rebels and other armed groups are located, but Binag declined to give details.He said they patterned their security measures on preparations they laid out during previous elections in the country, where vote counting machines are transported immediately and heavily secured at storage areas.6 challengesMeanwhile, the Department of Health (DOH) is looking at six challenges that must be hurdled to ensure the smooth implementation of the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program.At a press briefing yesterday, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said last Tuesday’s simulation exercise to rehearse vaccine deployment “went well, in general.”Vergeire, however, noted that there are still “challenges” to be encountered when vaccination is actually being rolled out.The first concern, according to the DOH official, is “vaccine wastage,” given the importance of the vaccines.“The challenge for us would be (to) ensure that there will be no vaccine wastage, that no dose will be wasted. We are putting some safeguards to prevent this from happening,” she said.The DOH is also worried about “vaccine confidence” as there are studies that 45 percent of Filipinos are not willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, although the government is addressing this by having alternative vaccinees in each vaccination site.Another challenge, according to Vergeire, is to keep the public observing health protocols after being vaccinated.“We all know that the vaccines do not have the capacity to block transmission. Meaning, even if you are vaccinated, you can still be infected and you can still transmit this virus,” she said, adding that the vaccines only provide “lesser chances of severe hospitalization,” among others.The fourth challenge is the vaccine brand or the various “platforms” of the vaccines that are available now.“People should have a choice, but we can’t give them the choice right now because of global shortage. So that’s a challenge for us on how we can convince them that even if their choice is B, but A is the one available, they should accept it already,” Vergeire said.The DOH is also considering “cold chain and logistics” as another issue in COVID-19 vaccination, expecting that the distribution and transportation of the vaccines in the provinces to be more challenging compared with those in Metro Manila.“The last (challenge) is monitoring the adverse events. We have to monitor recipients not only for days but for a long period of time for adverse reactions,” Vergeire said.56,000 medical frontlinersAround 56,000 medical frontliners and hospital staff in COVID-19 referral hospitals will be the first in line to get vaccinated with the 117,000 Pfizer-BioNTech doses that will be supplied through the COVAX facility and will arrive in the country this month.The government has started processing recipients of the vaccines in four referral hospitals in Metro Manila for the first tranche of inoculations, according to Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Martin Andanar. These are the Philippine General Hospital in Manila, Lung Center of the Philippines and East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City and Dr. Jose Natalio Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center (Tala Hospital) in Caloocan City.“As we move forward this 2021, the government is set to roll out the national COVID-19 vaccination program this month with an initial target of 56,000 health care workers in four referral hospitals in Metro Manila. Next in line will be health care workers in other COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila, Cebu City and Davao City,” Andanar said during the Pagdu-aw sa Butuan City: Explain, Explain, Explain Town Hall Meeting last Tuesday. – Romina Cabrera, Emmanuel Tupas, Sheila Crisostomo, ChristinaMendez",Philstar

There were some minor kinks that we observed based on the agreed protocol and what happen. But these were correctible ones that’s why the exercise was fruitful so that the minor details of the plan that was omitted shall have been addressed and shall be corrected as it comes in the actual transport of the vaccines,” Bernadas said during a virtual media forum yesterday.Bernadas added that the exercise was meant to orient their partners, the media and the public on how the national government and the recipient regional offices and the recipient hospital response to the transport of the vaccines which the time element of which is very much critical in the handling and distribution of the vaccines.The DOH-7 chief said that regional vaccination program is patterned after the national government vaccination plan which  targets 100 percent of the population but the initial 35 percent  will be the frontliners, the senior citizens, indigent population and the rest of government as frontliners and their partners in the hospital and in the private sector.Bernadas said that 585 vials times 5 doses or around 1,900 doses will arrive in Cebu (for VSMMC frontliners and employees only) between February 12 to 15 as initial share of Cebu out of the first batch of 114,000 doses to arrive in the country.‘Get vaccinated’As the country gears up the vaccine rollout next week, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) ordered yesterday the Philippine National Police (PNP) to treat and secure vaccines as gold.“Ang mga bakuna na ‘yan ay parang ginto lalo na ngayong kulang pa ang supply kaya pinaghahanda natin ang PNP sa anumang insidente,” said DILG Officer-in-Charge (OIC) and Undersecretary Bernardo  Florece Jr.More than a historical milestone, the national vaccination program aims to save lives and is expected to put an end to this pandemic, Florece said.As such, the DILG has directed the PNP to be in close coordination with the LGUs so that these vaccines are secured and protected.“Pagdating sa airport hanggang sa maiturok ang mga ito, kasama na ang ating kapulisan,” said Florece.The National Task Force COVID-19 aims to inoculate first the healthcare sector’s 1.4 million individuals.Florece said that as a member of the Task Group Supply Chain and Logistics, the PNP is expected to be a constant presence in accordance with the national government’s vaccination plan, primarily to secure and protect the COVID-19 vaccines and the team that will be administering them.According to the Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan, local officials such as barangay captains and barangay safety officers, including the barangay tanods, are also expected to aid in the vaccination.“Tulad ng lagi nating paalala, we need all the help that we can get sa pandemyang ito lalo na sa nalalapit na pagbabakuna sa ating bansa kaya ang ating PNP, kasama ang mga pinuno ng barangay at mga tanod, ay inaasahan nating makikipagtulungan at makikiisa,” Florece said. — Caecent No-ot Magsumbol, JMD (FREEMAN)",Philstar

Rounded up, that brings 19.4% approved and 6.0% strongly approved.The Philippines has remained the region's second-worst hit by the pandemic. Its neighbor Indonesia which has the highest number of cases at 1.17 million and nearly 32,000 deaths, yielded a 50.4% disapproval against 24.1% approved and 25.6% neutral.In contrast, Vietnam had the highest approval rating among its more specialized citizens at 96.6%, followed by Brunei at 93.9% and Singapore at 92.4%.Hanoi and the city-state of Singapore had both earned praise for their coronavirus response, with only 2,070 cases and 35 deaths for the former and with 59,747 infections and 29 fatalities, according to the Johns Hopkins University and Medicine.Bandar Seri Begawan, meanwhile, had so far reported a slim 182 cases and three deaths.In the early stages of the pandemic in Southeast Asia, Singapore was actually close to Jakarta in the highest cases, with Manila then at third. But with authorities managing to keep it at nearly 60,000 at present, it seems that its handling has worked better than that of the two other countries.The study had 1,032 specialized respondents from ten ASEAN member states with 6.5% coming from the Philippines, and was held from Nov. 18, 2020 to Jan. 10, 2021. Its margin of error was not stated.Most of those who took part in it were from the academe, think tanks or research institutions at 45.4%, those from government at 30.7%, civil society, non-government organizations or media at 9.3%, business or finance at 9.2% and regional or international organizations at 5.3%.Those between 21 to 35 years old made up most of the participants at 34.9%, individuals between 36 to 45 at 30.6%, those 46 to 60 at 23%, those above 60 at 9.3% and those under 21 at a measly 2.2%.Where to improve?An overwhelming majority of 72.2% from the country said there is a need to encourage more science and health experts ""to contribute to public policy discussions"" and for government to heed their advice.Such an observation bears more weight especially since the Duterte administration has long been criticized for its militaristic approach to a health crisis, with the president putting retired military officials to lead the coronavirus task force, as well as deploying cops and soldiers to carry out pandemic-related curbs.RELATED: 'Medical quarantine, not ECQ': Health professionals call for change in 'militaristic' lockdownsSome 58.3% said the government should invest in early warning systems for future pandemic outbreaks, as well as for research and development for testing and vaccine development. Officials have sought to claim that the administration had prioritized improving the country's testing capacity since the start of the pandemic, but the previous months have showed that screening efforts are still largely carried out by private-run laboratories.But a lesson it has learned to carry out was establishing a virology research institute under the science and technology department, with a P284 million ($5.9 million) funding for this year.Further in the report, 33.3% said better financial relief and subsidies should be offered to the millions economically affected by the pandemic. Some 30.6%, meanwhile, said officials should lead in following health protocols instead of flouting them, as is shown in a series of documented incidents by no less than the president's men and some lawmakers, and 5.6% said the measures should be better implemented in public.RELATED: Whatever happened to: Quarantine violators in Philippine government""These findings confirm that while ASEAN member governments have done relatively well in their public health response, they will need to do more to be better prepared in the long-term for future outbreaks,"" the report said.Leadership, challenges in the pandemicIn total, 32.7% of the respondents said Singapore had provided the best leadership in the region during the course of the health crisis, followed by Vietnam at 31.1%.Only 0.5% of all participants picked the Philippines for the said criteria, the lowest, with 6% being Filipinos and 0.6% from Myanmar.The pandemic has also emerged as the top challenge respondents believe Southeast Asia is facing, followed by unemployment and economic recession and socio-economic gaps and rising income disparity.For Filipinos, 80.6% agreed that the COVID-19 is the Number 1 challenge, followed by ""more intense and frequent weather events"" as a result of climate change at 59.7%, unemployment and the recession at 65.7%, along with increased military tensions such as in the South China Sea at 37.3% and 28.4% on widening socio-econimic gaps.Only 3% of them answered terrorism, 11.9% on domestic political instability and 13.4% on the deterioration of human rights conditions.""While it is not meant to present the definitive Southeast Asian view of current affairs, the survey acts as a barometer of the general attitudes and perceptions of interested stakeholders on important regional developments,"" the report added.In January, an assessment by another independent think tank placed the Philippines at 79th place globally out of almost 100 nations in handling the coronavirus pandemic, making it one of the ""underperformers"" in Asia Pacific.While health officials have said that they welcome such researchers on the health crisis, they said that the study had failed to grasp ""the complex nature of pandemic response,"" and adding that ""we can't be comparing apples to oranges.""The Philippines is nearing a year into its community quarantine first set in March 2020 to become the world's longest.

""'Pag sinabi nating indicative, 'yan po 'yung mga tentative schedule pa lang. Wala pa po tayong confirmed dates.""(When we say indicative, those are still tentative schedules so far. We don't have confirmed dates yet.)Still, the senior health official said inoculation would begin two to three days once the doses are delivered, with health workers first to receive the vaccines under government's priority list. According to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., doses from the COVAX facility would include millions from AstraZeneca and some 117,000 from Pfizer, candidate vaccines which have been cleared for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration.Officials also held a simulation exercise on Tuesday for the jabs' arrival in a bid to show readiness in undertaking a giant effort of vaccination 50 to 70 million in 2021 alone.Commenting on the move, Vergeire said they encountered ""bottlenecks"", which she said they had already expected and eventually resolved. ""Yesterday, the simulation was ongoing and transport vehicles were passing through [South Luzon Expressway], and [noong] papunta na sa [Research Institute for Tropical Medicine], biglang mayroong aksidenteng malaki so the transport vehicles had to go through another route,"" she said.(As the transport vehicles were passing there was a huge accident so they had to go throug another route.)President Rodrigo Duterte had significantly pinned his hopes on the vaccines over the course of the health crisis, but his administration has faced criticisms in the bid to secure doses, particularly that it was late into engaging in talks with drugmakers as well as its preference for the Chinese-made Sinovac.",Philstar

We have instructed already the initial sites for vaccination that they should have this number of individuals that should substitute for those who will be refusing on the day itself,” she said.The quick substitution list must have at least 20% of the target vaccine recipients. For example, if 800 people are scheduled to be inoculated on the day of vaccination, there should be 160 back up vaccine recipients who can be contacted in case people back out or miss their appointment.  “We don’t have a basis for the 20%. We just want to be sure that if we have those who refuse on the day of vaccination, at least we have this reserve of 20%,” Vergeire said.The guidelines of the quick substitution list are still being finalized but the health official said it must include those in the priority sectors.The government faces the challenge of conducting a massive COVID-19 vaccination program, which relies heavily on public trust that vaccines are both effective and safe following the highly politicized Dengvaxia controversy in 2017.Almost half of Filipinos were not inclined to get vaccinated against COVID-19 mainly due to safety concerns, a survey released by Pulse Asia in January suggested. Only 32% of the 2,400 adult respondents said their will get COVID-19 jabs, while the remaining 21% were undecided.A separate Social Weather Stations survey released last year showed that 66% of adult Filipinos were willing to receive COVID-19 jabs, while 31% were not.The government is aiming to secure a total of 146 to 148 vaccine doses to inoculate at least 50 million people this year alone but it has yet to execute definitive supply agreements with pharmaceutical companies.  Officials are anticipating the arrival of an initial batch of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine obtained through the COVAX facility this month.

Duterte also ordered the customs bureau to ensure the unhampered arrival of the vaccines, noting that the shots have to be placed in storage facilities as soon as possible to prevent spoilage.""Do not delay and do not hinder or obstruct the smooth flow that you are seeing right now, from the time of the arrival to the time of clearance... Your job in customs is to look (at the shipments). You have no business opening them.  You are not allowed to do that. I am not allowing you anybody there in the airport to open,"" the President said. Duterte said the police should provide escorts to ensure that the vaccines would be transported to local governments in the fastest way possible. The President also suggested the use of public school buildings as vaccination sites, saying military and police installations may not be enough to accommodate all recipients.""If there is no large coliseum or gym, then we will utilize the schools....I do not see any objectionable thing there,"" he said.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. said the government's pandemic task force has coordinated with various agencies to ensure the smooth arrival and delivery of vaccines. He said the customs processing of the vaccines won't take more than 30 minutes.",Philstar
