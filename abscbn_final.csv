MANILA — The Philippines will get its first batch of COVID-19 shots from Pfizer-BioNTech next month, which would boost the country's inoculation drive, an official said on Wednesday.The lack of an inoculation deal had delayed the supposed arrival in mid-February of 117,000 Pfizer doses from COVID-19 vaccine-sharing COVAX Facility that the World Health Organization leads with other groups.“Nag-commit na po iyong WHO na darating po iyong 117,000 doses ng Pfizer ngayong Abril, sa susunod na buwan,” said Vince Dizon, deputy chief implementer of the National Task Force against COVID-19.
“Malaking bagay rin po ito, lalong-lalo na para sa ating health care workers na priority nating matapos hanggang buwan ng Abril at Mayo,” he said in a televised public briefing.

Authorities expect to get 1.4 million more Sinovac shots and another AstraZeneca batch from COVAX this March, he said.The Philippines aims to inoculate up to 70 million people or about two-thirds of its population against the novel coronavirus this year.Among the worst hit by the pandemic in Asia, the Philippines next week would mark the first year since government enforced quarantine restrictions that left businesses struggling and millions jobless.As millions go jobless, Palace says cash aid not an option for now

MANILA — The Philippines has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday, as the government aims to inoculate 100,000 to 200,000 Filipinos daily in a national vaccine rollout.
“After a thorough review of currently available data by medical and regulatory experts, the FDA today is granting emergency use authorization to Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a virtual briefing.He said that “the benefit of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risks.”
The approval comes 3 weeks since the US-based company applied for emergency use authorization (EUA) in the Philippines.
An EUA means a vaccine approved by the countries where they were developed can be used locally after 21 days, down from the current required 6-month verification, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said.Philippines allows emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines, drugs
Pfizer’s vaccine is the only one that has been included in the World Health Organization’s emergency list. Among other vaccine frontrunners, it also has EUAs in the most number of countries.
An EUA allows Pfizer’s vaccine to be imported, distributed and administered in the Philippines through a national immunization program.
Domingo said the vaccine, based on interim data of Phase III trials, has an efficacy rate of 95%. The efficacy rate for all racial groups was at 92%.
SIDE EFFECTS
“The adverse events were transient and mostly mild to moderate, similar to common vaccine reactions among other vaccines that are in use now,” he added.
While there were no safety concerns, Domingo noted that “more adverse effects may be observed” based on close monitoring of those already immunized.
“The roll out of the vaccine and its use in more than 5 million people worldwide has identified also severe allergic reaction in a few individuals. Therefore the vaccination must be done by health professionals trained to recognize and manage such adverse reactions and they should have resources at hand to adequately respond and manage such cases,” the official said.
Unlike other vaccines, Pfizer and BioNTech is a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine, which utilizes newer technology. While it has a high efficacy rate, it requires ultra cold storage, making it difficult for poor countries to import and store it.
Domingo said the vaccine requires storage with temperatures of -80 to -60 degrees Celsius and can only be used for people who are 16 years and older.Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez said on Wednesday that Pfizer may be the first vaccine to enter the country through the help of the COVAX Facility, an international platform that aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines. This means Pfizer may be the first vaccine to be used in the country, ahead of China’s vaccines from biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac.

Galvez earlier said that the Pfizer vaccine will most likely be used in Metro Manila and other areas near the vaccine hubs in Cebu and Davao because of its storage requirements.PROCUREMENT
Domingo reminded the public that the EUA is not a marketing authorization or a Certificate of Product Registration, which means the vaccine cannot be sold commercially. It cannot be sold by pharmaceutical stores or doctors.
Instead, “Pfizer Inc. (Philippines) shall supply Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine only to emergency response stakeholders consistent with the terms and conditions of this EUA including Department of Health (DOH) or the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF),” Domingo said.
He added that the DOH can also authorize public and private health facilities, local government units and other members of the private sector to procure the vaccine.
The EUA also requires Pfizer, if there is no agreement with the government, to provide appropriate cold storage requirements until the vaccine is delivered to the vaccination sites.
MONITORING
Domingo said the government will be monitoring adverse events after Pfizer is used for the national immunization program.“Submission of serious and non-serious adverse reaction reports is mandatory,” he said.
Recipients of the vaccine will also receive fact sheets with information on the vaccine and when they will receive the second dose. They will also be asked to sign a written informed consent before being vaccinated.
Currently, the FDA is also evaluating the EUA applications of AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Institute of Russia and Sinovac from China.
Domingo said the companies still have pending documents and will be evaluated within the 21-day period they have set for EUA processing.",abscbn

MANILA - The manufacturer of COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin can allocate at least 10 million doses for the Philippines, an adviser to one of the local distributors said Tuesday.
India's Bharat Biotech and the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research developed Covaxin together, and it was approved by the country's drug regulator based on early and intermediate studies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi was inoculated with the drug earlier this month.
Modi takes home-grown vaccine as India widens immunization drive
Bharat Biotech reported last week that its vaccine has an interim vaccine efficacy of 81% in late-stage clinical trials. This analysis was based on the trial among 25,800 participants.
The company has applied for emergency use authorization in the Philippines last January.

Noel Miranda, scientific adviser to local company IP Biotech, said they are ""working on 10 to 20 million doses that could be allocated for the Philippines alone throughout 2021 to 2022.""
IP Biotech and Ambica International have an exclusive agreement with Bharat Biotech to distribute the Covaxin in the Philippines.
""We have kind of an access to an allocation of about 10 to 20 million and we want them to start coming in as soon as April,"" Miranda told ANC's Headstart.
Pressed if the number would be for 5 or 10 individuals receiving the 2 doses necessary, he said it would be ""at least 10 million"" and affirmed that he was pertaining to doses.
Bharat's website said Covaxin ""is a 2-dose vaccination regimen given 28 days apart."" It does not require sub-zero storage and reconstitution. It is in ""ready to use liquid presentation in multi-dose vials, stable at 2-8 degrees Celsius.""
A single dose of Covaxin would cost around $14, said Miranda.
""It’s not going to be far from Sinovac, but this is something to be negotiated as well. We are doing our best to come out with a good negotiation,"" he said.
The Philippines is currently building its vaccine portfolio in the hopes to vaccinate at least 70 percent of its population to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19. The country's Food and Drug Administration has so far granted EUA to the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac.
The Department of Health reported 3,356 additional COVID-19 cases on Monday, bringing the total to 597,763. It was the fourth straight day that there were more than 3,000 new reported infections.

MANILA (2nd UPDATE) — The Philippines on Thursday signed a second purchase purchase agreement that raised to 17 million the COVID-19 vaccine doses it will get from British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca, which the government plans to distribute in remote communities.
More than 300 companies and 39 local governments units (LGUs) across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao joined the endeavor.
""AstraZeneca maintains our sure commitment to give access with no profit,"" said Lotis Ramin, country president of AstraZeneca. ""Today, we are delighted to conclude 17 million doses which can reach millions of people.""
The Philippines' vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. thanked AstraZeneca for ""this partnership [that] will help us to save more than 8 million lives.""
Last November, the government and around 30 private firms signed a deal for 2.6 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses.
The new 17 million doses from the British-Swedish drugmaker are expected to be delivered mid-2021.
The 300 firms include the food, tourism, industrial, retail, and BPO sectors. Fifty percent of the procured vaccines will be donated to the government and 50 percent will be given to prioritized employees who serve as frontliners in their industries.
Some of the LGUs that took part of the signing were the cities of Makati, Caloocan, Mandaluyong, Manila, Muntinlupa, Navotas, Pasay, Pasig, Quezon City, San Juan, Valenzuela and Las Piñas for Metro Manila. For Luzon, the provinces and areas of Ilocos; Isabela; Nueva Ecija; Quirino; Baguio; Dagupan; San Nicolas, Pangasinan; Puerto Princesa City; Pulilan, Bulacan; Sta. Rosa, Laguna; Taal, Batangas; Vigan, Iloilo; Negros Occidental; Ormoc City and Palompon, Leyte; Bacolod City; Davao; Oroguieta; and Zamboanga City.
With nearly 495,000 coronavirus infections, the Philippines has the second highest caseload in Southeast Asia, next to Indonesia. The government aims to inoculate up to 70 million Filipinos this year.
The Philippines has secured 30 million COVID-19 doses from the Serum Institute of India, and 25 million jabs from China's Sinovac Biotech.
On Wednesday, the Philippine embassy in Washington announced that the country is also in the final stages of negotiations for the procurement of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccines,
According to Manila's envoy to the United States, Jose Manuel ""Babe"" Romualdez, the Philippines would be able to secure a ""minimum"" of 10 million vaccine doses from the firm, to be delivered by the middle of this year.

COVID-19 vaccines that do not require ultra-cold storage include those from Sinovac, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, and Novavax, said Galvez.
""Ito po ang puwede nating i-deploy sa far-flung areas dahil hindi po ito nangangailangan ng minus [zero] cold chain,"" Galvez said in a public briefing on Tuesday.

MANILA — The Philippines is negotiating for 10 million jabs against the novel coronavirus from Johnson & Johnson, an official leading the inoculation drive said on Tuesday, as the country raced to secure vaccine doses.
The J&J vaccine requires a single shot, making the logistics of its distribution ""uncomplicated,"" said Carlito Galvez, Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.Washington may authorize the US-developed vaccine for emergency use in ""2 weeks or 3 weeks from now"", and supply may arrive in the Philippines in the third quarter of this year, said Galvez, who is also the Philippines' vaccine czar.
""Sumulat po ako sa management na taasan pa ang quota natin to 10 million,"" he said in a briefing.(I wrote to the management to increase our quota to million doses.)
The J&J vaccine is in late-stage trials as a single dose, in contrast to 2-shot vaccines from Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which were also developed in the US.
The Philippines hopes to vaccinate up to 70 million people this year, starting February.
The country's first vaccine doses will likely come from Pfizer, UK's AstraZeneca, or Chinese firm Sinovac, Galvez said.So far, the Philippines has secured 30 million shots from the Serum Institute of India, 25 million from Sinovac, 20 million from Moderna, 17 million from AstraZeneca, and 40 million from the Covax Facility.
The Philippines' Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authority only for Pfizer's vaccine candidate, as of Tuesday.

Panfilo Lacson on Tuesday said the Philippines' slow procurement of COVID-19 vaccines is ""embarrassing"" as the country still continues to study which brand should be procured, while other nations have either begun mass inoculations or are awaiting delivery.
Other countries have already purchased COVID-19 vaccines while the Philippines has yet to place an actual order for the drug, Lacson said in an interview on TeleRadyo.
""Parang kahiya-hiya na 'yung gobyerno... Naka-ilang loans na ba tayo para sa vaccine? Bakit hanggang ngayon ay wala tayong vaccine?"" the senator said.
(The government looks embarrassing... How many loans have we gotten for the vaccine? Why don't we have the vaccines up to now?)
The Philippines' 2.5 million doses from AstraZeneca was made possible because the private sector helped fund the deal provided that their employees would get half of the procured shots, Lacson said.

""Hindi ba disgusting na private sector pa ang nanguna para magkaroon tayo ng pangunahing vaccine na proven naman dahil ginagamit sa ibang bansa?"" he said.
(Isn't it disgusting that the private sector led this initiative to procure vaccines that are already proven effective in other countries?)

Lacson noted that a purely government initiative for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines has yet to take place, noting that the Food and Drug Administration has yet to issue a certification to legalize the use of any COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
""Mamamatay tayo sa kaka-study,"" said the senator, who has never confirmed reports he had already taken a shot against COVID-19.(We are going to die just doing studies.)

Several local government units have already allotted funds for the procurement of vaccines for their constituents but have yet to finalize the deals as the national government has yet to announce the country's masterplan for the inoculation against the global pandemic.
""'Yung New Zealand nga may announcement yung Prime Minister na, 'Sobra 'yung aming naprocure, do-donate na lang namin sa neighboring countries na nangangailangan.' Habang tayo nakakalungkot na hanggang ngayon naguusap pa tayo kung ano 'yung vaccine na ia-approve,"" he said.
(New Zealand's Prime Minister has already announced that they have procured too many vaccines and would donate some of it to neighboring countries, while we in the Philippines are still sadly discussing which vaccine to approve.)
Lacson earlier blamed Health Secretary Francisco Duque III for the allegedly botched COVID-19 vaccine deal with US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer after the latter's supposed failure to submit documentary requirements on time.
The Pfizer vaccines meant for the Philippines instead went to Singapore, making the city state the first Southeast Asian nation to receive COVID-19 vaccines.

MANILA - The Philippines will receive at least 161 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine doses by yearend, a government official said Monday, hours after the country began its immunization program against the deadly disease.
National COVID-19 task force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr., in a public briefing, said that of the 161 million, 44 million will be procured from the COVAX Facility, an initiative which aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for all.

MANILA (UPDATE2) — Malacañang confirmed on Tuesday that the Philippines will get 20 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, as the country pursues procurement deals with various drug firms.
Authorities have signed a term sheet for the Moderna jabs, said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.
The private sector and local governments will help pay for the shots because Moderna's vaccine is among the ""most sought"" after and priciest, said Secretary Carlito Galvez, chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.""Magbibigay [po ang Moderna] ng ilang vaccine sa May,"" he told reporters in an online briefing, but did not say how many doses.
(Moderna will send some vaccine doses in May.)

In a forum organized by the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines, Galvez told government officials that a shot of Moderna would cost around $20 to $25.
The Philippine embassy in Washington announced last week that Manila is in the final stages of negotiations for the procurement of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine.
According to Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez, the Philippines would be able to secure a ""minimum"" of 10 million vaccine doses from the firm, to be delivered by the middle of this year.
The agreement allows the ""option to purchase an additional 10 million doses,"" he said.PH in 'final stages' of securing Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, says envoy to US
Roque said the Philippines has term sheets as well with 3 other COVID-19 vaccine makers namely, Novavax, AstraZeneca from the UK, and China's Sinovac.
The government aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of its population, this year.
Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech's COVID-19 shots are authorized for use in Europe and the United States.
According to a Reuters report, the two aren not well-suited to lower-income countries due to expensive storage requirements.
Pfizer’s, which has already secured an EUA from the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration, has to be stored at -70°C, requiring costly equipment and infrastructure, and is expensive at roughly US$20 a dose.
Moderna’s, however, can be kept in a standard refrigerator for up to 30 days, but is even more expensive. The FDA has yet to receive Moderna's application for EUA in the Philippines.
Low- and middle-income countries have consequently struck few direct deals to buy these vaccines.
Currently, the FDA is assessing the EUA applications of AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Institute of Russia, and Sinovac.

""We are ready to share our technology... We want to cultivate a long-term partnership, which will be beneficial for both countries,"" Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev said in a virtual forum organized by the Philippine-Russian Business Assembly.
""Our final aim is to produce the Russian vaccine here in the Philippines,"" he added.
Russia's coronavirus vaccine candidate, Sputnik V, had shown encouraging results in 2 small trials, according to data published in Britain's prestigious medical journal, The Lancet.
The vaccine, developed by the Gamaleya Research Institute in coordination with the Russian defense ministry, is ""safe, well tolerated, and does not cause serious adverse events in healthy adult volunteers,"" the report showed.
""This publication itself is a testament to the safety of the vaccine... The Russian vaccine is 100 percent safe and effective,"" Khovaev said.
The vaccine, named after the world's first satellite launched by the Soviet Union in 1957, will still undergo large-scale testing or Phase 3 clinical trial to assess its safety and efficacy.
PH, Russia to run simultaneous phase 3 clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccine
The Philippines and Russia have been negotiating on holding possible Phase 3 clinical trials of Sputnik V, which the Palace earlier said could start in October.
Khovaev said the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) was still studying the results of Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the clinical trials.
""We are ready to launch the clinical trial as soon as possible. We are ready to move forward,"" he added.
Khovaev said the DOST earlier committed 1,000 Filipino participants if the Phase 3 clinical trial of Sputnik V pushes through.

MANILA (UPDATE) - An additional 38,400 doses of COVID-19 vaccines from British-Swedish drug firm AstraZeneca arrived in Manila Sunday night.
The second batch of AstraZeneca vaccines from the COVAX Facility arrived at 6:43 p.m. at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3.
Health officials, Sec. Carlito Galvez and COVID-19 testing czar Vince Dizon, along with Manila International Airport Authority General Manager Ed Monreal, and representatives of the World Health Organization and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) welcomed the vaccines from Amsterdam.
The vaccines will be transported to the Department of Health cold storage facility in Marikina City.
This is the third batch of donated vaccines to arrive in Manila.
The vaccines were loaded on a Boeing 777 commercial flight of Royal Dutch Airline flight KLM803 from Amsterdam via Bangkok in Thailand.

MANILA - The Philippines will have access to the coronavirus vaccine of the US, Malacañang said Tuesday, after a biotech firm in its Western ally announced that its drug against the COVID-19 disease was almost 95-percent effective.The US' top infectious disease scientist on Monday hailed the coronavirus vaccine of Moderna as ""stunningly impressive"", following a clinical trial with more than 30,000 participants. Last week, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech also said their vaccine was 90 percent effective.""We have firm commitments from the United States... that we will have access po to COVID vaccines that may be developed in the United States,"" said Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque.He said US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo relayed this information to Manila's Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin.Philippines to borrow $300 million for coronavirus vaccine: Duterte
China has promised to supply its future COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines, while the UK agreed with the World Health Organization that it would give its potential vaccine to poor countries, said Roque.
Both US vaccine frontrunners are based on new technology that uses synthetic versions of molecules called ""messenger RNA"" to hack into human cells, and effectively turn them into vaccine-making factories.
""The idea that we have a 94.5 percent effective vaccine is stunningly impressive,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, which co-developed the vaccine.""It is really a spectacular result that I don't think anybody had anticipated would be this good.""
Moderna plans to submit applications for emergency approval around the world within weeks, and says it expects to have approximately 20 million doses ready to ship in the US by the end of the year.
The company, which has received $2 billion from the US government under ""Operation Warp Speed,"" added it is on track to manufacture between 500 million to a billion doses globally in 2021.

It is not yet clear how long-lasting the protection will be from either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines. Another open question is whether they stop people who are exposed to the virus from transmitting it on to the other people, even though they may be themselves protected from the disease.

MANILA - The government expects to roll out vaccines against COVID-19 in the middle of 2021, according to vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr., noting the “scarcity of supply” in the global market.
Galvez said negotiations have been ongoing for Chinese vaccine Sinovac to arrive in the country by March next year and for vaccines from British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca to be delivered around May. The government is also negotiating with Pfizer and J&J.
“If we can sign this December, normally po itong US and western vaccines, 6 months po ang grace period to produce and deliver. So kung ngayon magkakaroon tayo ng signing, earliest talaga is June, July,” he said Thursday in an online forum organized by the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines.
“At least mayroon tayong assurance na mayroon na po tayong more or less 30 million doses only from AstraZeneca, and maybe ‘pag maganda po ang negotiation natin sa limang manufacturers, we can go up to 60 million doses,” Galvez added.
He also allayed possible concerns against the safety of the vaccine from China, which will likely be the first to arrive in the country.
“Ang Sinovac po is talagang safe and effective, kasi nagamit na po nila ‘yan sa China on a limited scale,” Galvez said.
FOCUS AREAS FOR COVID-19 IMMUNIZATION PROGRAM
Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Davao City, Cebu City, and Cagayan de Oro City will be among the focus areas for the COVID vaccine rollout, according to Galvez.Baguio City, Bacolod City, Iloilo City, Zamboanga City, Tacloban City, and General Santos City are also among the priority areas for the vaccine.
“‘Pag cities ang inuna natin, more than 80% of our economy will recover. We will prioritize first ‘yung mga mostly affected area,” Galvez said.
He noted that areas with cold chain facilities will likely receive the vaccine from Pfizer, while vaccines from AstraZeneca and Sinovac will be for provinces without such a facility and geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas.
“‘Yung Pfizer, most likely po ‘yan sa NCR, Cebu, at saka sa Davao, sa Cagayan de Oro. ‘Yung major cities,” Galvez said.
“‘Yung AstraZeneca at saka ‘yung Sinovac, ‘yan ang pwede sa mga probinsya at GIDAs area natin,” he added.
Priority will also be given to health workers, frontliners, senior citizens, indigents, and uniformed personnel.Galvez advised LGUs in focus areas to identify vaccine centers, which may include medical schools, Level-3 hospitals, and schools located near hospitals. He also sought their assistance in encouraging the public to support the vaccination program.
“We will follow your lead po doon sa public information and education effort to boost confidence on the vaccine and to encourage more people to accept vaccination program,” ULAP National President Gov. Dakila Cua replied.
SHOULD LOCAL OFFICIALS BE PRIORITIZED IN VACCINATION VS. COVID?
Galvez believes local officials should also be among the first ones to get the vaccine against COVID in order to boost public confidence on the program.
“Dapat kayo ang mauna para makita na talagang safe ‘yung vaccines. Maybe in essence, dapat ‘yung mayors, governors, pangunahan natin para mawala ‘yung takot nila,” he explained.
A Social Weather Stations survey in November showed that 66% of adult Filipinos are willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
Galvez said the government will launch a series of information and education programs on the COVID-19 vaccine, and President Duterte himself will campaign for the vaccination program.
“Sinasabi nga namin kami ang mauuna kung gusto nilang magkaroon ng confidence, so they have the confidence that the vaccine is safe and effective,” Galvez said.
“We might be looking also at some legal procedures that we can maximize the vaccination of our people,” he added, but also stressed that for now, getting the vaccine against COVID is voluntary.
The government targets to vaccinate close to 25 million Filipinos or 22.8% of the population next year.But with the assistance of the private sector, Galvez said an additional 10.5 million Filipinos, including teachers, government workers, essential workers in the transportation and food industries, and OFWs may also be covered in the vaccination program against COVID.
Funding for the vaccine will come from the national budget, loans, and private sector financing. Galvez said the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank will also serve as procurement agents for the Philippines, each with a reserved P300 million to P500 million dollars for the country’s immunization program against COVID. The government expects the immunizaton program to last 3 to 5 years.

Jean-Christophe Verhaegen, AFPMANILA — The World Health Organization on Tuesday said the Philippines already received a side letter from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer Pfizer and that minor details are just being finalized in order for the country to receive its much-needed vaccines.
Pfizer’s vaccines through the COVAX Facility, of which WHO is a member, were supposed to be the first to arrive in the Philippines this month but the shipment was delayed due to the required indemnification agreement. The delay pushed back the scheduled immunization for health workers, who are being prioritized by the government.
Besides the need for an indemnification law or deal, “there are some several minor clauses” mentioned in a side letter sent by Pfizer to the Philippine government on Tuesday morning, according to WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe.
“So we believe that within the day today or tomorrow, or whenever the legal teams (finalize) those documents, we will see a resolution of that impasse, and maybe there'll be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe told reporters.
Pfizer vaccine, wala pang tiyak na petsa ng pagdating sa bansa: Roque
Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine is the first to receive an emergency use approval by the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration, followed by AstraZeneca and Sinovac.
Abeyasinghe previously said that besides the indemnification deal with COVAX, Pfizer is requiring a separate agreement for all countries ordering their vaccines through the COVAX Facility. He attributed the delay to Pfizer and not the Philippines.

He said that while the Philippines fulfilled all of its commitments to the COVAX Facility, which aims to give low and middle-income countries equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, “there have been some delays in finalizing the commitments between Pfizer-BioNtech, the manufacturer, and the Philippine government.”
“And we believe that the, that limited quantity of Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines will be shipped as early as possible,” he said, “once these required exchange of letters is completed, and the requirements are met by the Philippine government and the manufacturer of the vaccine Pfizer-BioNtech.”Abeyasinghe clarified that all countries receiving COVID-19 vaccines are required to sign indemnification agreements with COVAX or directly with the manufacturers.
“The indemnification requirement is because the vaccines that are being rolled out are emergency use listed vaccines and the manufacturers cannot take responsibility for rare adverse events that may occur in, say, one in a million or one in ten million people. And so they require protection,” he said when asked if the Philippines was required to sign an indemnification agreement only because of the so-called dengvaxia controversy that happened a few years ago.
The WHO official said the requirements are “common to all countries"" and are ""not specific to the Philippines.""""They are not related to any issue that happened in the country, relating to the vaccine, or anything else,” he said.
Abeyasinghe said a delayed rollout of vaccines will continue to put at risk those most vulnerable to COVID-19 and those most likely to die from severe illness.
“I believe that everybody is doing everything possible within their remit of responsibility to fast track vaccines deliveries to countries. So, I'm not sure what more we can do,” he said, adding that delays in the inoculation drive against COVID-19 are also happening in other countries.
The Philippines on Tuesday has reported a total of 564,865 COVID-19 cases, of which, 29,817 are active infections. The death toll stands at 12,107.
Aside from Pfizer's, donated vaccines from China's Sinovac are being expected this month by the Philippine government.

Huang added ""this has demonstrated China's determination to fight the pandemic in the spirit of solidarity and build a community"" with neighboring countries.The interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) on Friday announced it was recommending the administration of CoronaVac to health workers despite a 50.4 percent efficacy rate when it was given to medical frontliners exposed to COVID-19 during trials in Brazil.

Reports of smuggled doses and VIP vaccinations have hounded the country's delayed inoculation drive.The government expects the bulk of the country's COVID-19 vaccines to arrive in the third and the fourth quarters of 2021.Shots developed by Sinovac, Pfizer-BioNTech, and AstraZeneca have emergency use authorizations in the Philippines.The country's drug regulator also allowed the ""compassionate use"" of 10,000 doses of Chinese state firm Sinopharm's COVID-19 vaccine for Duterte's security detail, many of whom received the same product as early as September last year.

The pandemic, which triggered quarantine restrictions in the country beginning March last year, resulted in a -9.5 percent GDP growth for 2020.It is the first contraction since 1998's 0.5 percent decline due to the Asian financial crisis and worse than the 7 percent contraction recorded in 1984, making it the steepest post-war slump in Philippine history, using available PSA data dating back to 1947.

MANILA - A total of 756 people received their COVID-19 vaccine on the country's first day of inoculation, which was ""quite satisfactory,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Tuesday.
The Philippines received its first legal coronavirus shots from China's Sinovac Biotech on Sunday and began inoculating some frontline workers and a handful of officials on Monday.

""Yesterday’s rollout was quite satisfactory and there was much pride and joy in seeing that at long last, the health care workers had started to receive their vaccination, protection against COVID-19. It was really quite heartwarming to witness the historic event,"" Duque told ANC's Headstart.
""The total was 756 as of last reporting period yesterday,"" he said when asked how many were inoculated.

Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, director of the Philippine General Hospital, received the first authorized COVID-19 vaccine shot.Meet Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the first to be officially vaccinated against COVID-19 in PH
Food and Drug Administration Director-General Eric Domingo and Dr. Edsel Salvana, who is part of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group and also a PGH doctor, were also among the first to be inoculated.
Vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr. and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos, Jr. were also vaccinated at the PGH.
Duque, although present at different ceremonies on Monday, did not receive the vaccine as he was 64 years old. The emergency use authorization granted to the Sinovac vaccine states that it can only be administered to those aged 18 to 59.

The 600,000 doses from Sinovac that were donated by the Chinese government will be used for 300,000 people, said Duque. These shots will be deployed to different hospitals across the country, with about 12 hospitals expected to hold simultaneous vaccinations on Tuesday.
""We’re deploying to as many healthcare facilities as we can, but remember that we have only less than 20 percent of the total required doses of about 3.4 million needed to inoculate about 1.7 million health care workers,"" he said.
He also called on health workers to get themselves immunized with the vaccine currently available, as the government tries its best to get more brands into the country.
""I beg our health care workers: magpabakuna na po tayo. Wag na po tayong magduda o mag-alinlangan, magkaroon ng agam-agam dahil ang pinakamagandang bakuna po ay yung andito na,"" he said.
""Iisang klase pa lang po ito. Ginagawa ng inyong gobyerno, nagpupunyagi na talagang makapasok ang anim pang mga bakuna na atin pong aangkatin,"" he added.
(I beg of our health care workers: let us please get ourselves vaccinated. Let's not doubt or waver, have hesitations because the best vaccine is what's here. This is only one kind. Your government is striving to import 6 more vaccines.)
The FDA initially said the Sinovac vaccine was not recommended for health workers who were exposed to COVID-19 patients, but the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) later cleared its use despite the regulator's earlier reservations.
Vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca have earlier been given emergency use authorization as well. The Philippines had been expecting coronavirus shots from these brands from the COVAX facility, but these had been delayed.

So when it comes to allegations on bribery, I don't think that will happen to the Philippines.)
Duterte recently allowed the FDA to clear coronavirus vaccines and drugs for emergency use.
Sinovac's vaccine called CoronaVac has been approved for emergency use in China to vaccinate high-risk groups since July 2020.Having shown a substantial immune response and minimal safety concerns (mostly mild pain at the injection site) in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, CoronaVac is now in phase 3 clinical trials.
The phase 3 trials have recruited tens of thousands of participants to test vaccine efficacy and safety, and are taking place in Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey.
China is developing at least five COVID vaccines from four producers. These vaccines, which have progressed through development very rapidly, are largely based on traditional vaccine manufacturing techniques such as inactivating the virus.
These methods provide some benefits to the vaccines over others. For example, some of the Chinese-developed vaccines can be stored in regular fridges, making distribution much easier. This is in contrast to Pfizer’s jab, which must be kept at around -70 degrees Celsius.

MANILA (UPDATE) — The Philippines and private firms inked Friday a supply agreement for British drug group AstraZeneca's potential COVID-19 vaccine, the first such deal in a country aiming to further reopen its economy that has been ravaged by the pandemic.
The private firms will pay for the vaccine and donate half of the supply to the government, with the other half to be used to cover employees in the private sector, said Joey Concepcion, a government business adviser.The deal secures 2.6 million doses of the vaccine, set to arrive in the Philippines in May or June 2021. This will inoculate over 1 million Filipinos as the vaccine requires 2 doses, Concepcion said in a livestream of the ceremonial signing.The move ""will give our people the confidence that we now finally have the chance to beat the virus and win back the lives we lost,"" said Secretary Carlito Galvez, chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.""Through this partnership we are thinking and acting ahead of the virus,"" he said. ""Through this show of unity and selflessness, which we refer to as the bayanihan spirit, we are demonstrating to the world that although the pandemic knocked us down, we will rise up and come together as one.""The Philippines aims to inoculate around two-thirds of its 108 million population. It is negotiating for a 1 million more doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

COVID-19 vaccination may take up to 5 years, 35M Pinoys on priority list: official
The deal is another boost for AstraZeneca, which has already signed supply deals for more than 3 billion doses of its experimental vaccine developed with the University of Oxford.

QUESTIONS DELAYING ASTRAZENECA'S APPROVAL
AstraZeneca and its partner, the University of Oxford, announced on Monday that it was seeking regulatory approval for the vaccine after it showed an average 70 percent effectiveness.
That rate jumped to 90 percent when an initial half-dose then a full dose was given, similar to that in rival vaccines in development by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.
But US scientists have said the higher rate of effectiveness came during tests in people aged 55 and under, and was discovered by accident during the clinical trials, suggesting the regimen's efficacy in crucial older age groups is unproven in this interim data.
Questions over AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine data risk delaying approval
What we know about AstraZeneca's head-scratching vaccine results

""We believe that’s part of the whole process of these trials. Both showed very good results,"" said Concepcion.""And I believe that in the end, AstraZeneca and Oxford will be able to develop a very strong and potent vaccine. That’s why the private sector is putting its money down to be part of the first batch of the vaccines that will be delivered next year,"" he added.The head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, Andrew Pollard, said this week that further evidence will be available next month, but the result was still ""highly significant"".
The double jab vaccine is by far the least expensive among frontrunners, at about 2.5 euros or about P143 per dose.""I thank the Astra group for their efforts in really helping the Philippines. They have zero profit for the year 2021,"" said Concepcion.
The AstraZeneca vaccine also has a significant advantage when it comes to transport and storage.Moderna's vaccine must be kept at -20 degrees Celsius, while Pfizer's requires an even chillier -70C to remain viable. AstraZeneca's vaccine, by contrast, can be stored at the temperature of a normal fridge.
OTHER OPTIONSThe government is also in talks with China's Sinovac over a 20-50 million vaccine supply deal, as well as US drugmaker Pfizer, Galvez said earlier.
The Philippines, which has the second largest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Southeast Asia after Indonesia, has gradually lifted coronavirus curbs since May after imposing one of the strictest lockdowns globally.
The $370-billion economy, among the fastest growing in Asia before the pandemic, fell deeper into recession in the third quarter as curbs continued to limit economic activity.

MANILA-- President Rodrigo Duterte said Thursday the Philippines' first vaccine for the novel coronavirus might come from China, where the infectious disease originated as well.
Duterte, in a taped address aired Friday, appealed to Filipinos for patience, saying he hopes that the situation would go back to normal by December.
""I promise you, by the grace of God, I hope by December we will be back to normal,"" he said.

""Ang una nga makuha siguro natin from China,"" he added, noting that China's Sinopharm and Sinovac have reported progress in their inactive vaccines.
China says to prioritize Philippines for COVID-19 vaccine
Chinese firms are responsible for 2 of the 3 most advanced coronavirus vaccines that had entered Phase 3 trials, or large-scale testing on humans -- the last step before regulatory approval.
During his fifth State of the Nation Address, Duterte told Filipinos that he asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to prioritize the Philippines once China develops a vaccine.
Duterte says he asked China for credit, priority in COVID-19 vaccine
China, in turn, gave its word as it emphasized that the Philippines has been a ""friendly close neighbor.""
""Nangako sila na may priority tayo,"" the President said.
(They promised to prioritize us.)
""Hintayin lang ninyo by December kung makatiis kayo kasi kung maglabas kayo patay din eh,"" the President told Filipinos.
(Just wait by December because if you go out now, you will also die.)
The rapidly spreading COVID-19 was first reported in China in December last year and has since become a global health and economic crisis that has infected over 17 million worldwide and battered various economies into recession.
While leaders such as US President Donald Trump have been criticial of China over the pandemic, Duterte has been supportive of Beijing, even thanking the East Asian nation for its support to the Philippines during the crisis.
The Philippines as of Thursday confirmed 89,374 COVID-19 infections, of which, 22,327 are active.

""The Chinese are not lacking in brains,"" Duterte said in a late-night televised address on Wednesday. ""The Chinese are bright. They would not venture (into producing vaccines) if it is not safe, sure and secure.""
Duterte made the remarks as questions have been raised over the level of protection Sinovac Biotech's experimental COVID-19 vaccine can provide, after researchers in Brazil released late-stage clinical data showing efficacy that was lower than initially announced.

We are not lagging behind.)
A tripartite deal with the national government and a vaccine maker allows a private firm or a local government to secure supplies of COVID-19 vaccine.In November, around 30 local firms signed an agreement for 2.6 million AstraZeneca vaccine jabs. Half of these will be donated to the government, and the rest will go to the companies' workers.A second order was placed for an additional 3.7 to 3.8 million doses, said presidential adviser on entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion.

AstraZeneca had said that its COVID-19 vaccine could be around 90% effective, giving the world another weapon to fight the global pandemic and potentially cheaper to make, easier to distribute and faster to scale-up than rivals.
Around 13 million Filipinos will be vaccinated through efforts led by the private sector and local governments, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said on Tuesday.Aside from AstraZeneca, the government has secured 30 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from the Serum Institute of India, and 25 million jabs from China's Sinovac Biotech.In a televised briefing Wednesday night, Galvez said the Serum Institute of India has also allocated another 10 million doses for the Philippines, in case some private companies and local government units want to avail of their vaccine.
""Sa Serum Institute of India, 'yung Novavax, mayroon po tayo, napirmahan na po, 30 million doses, so secured na po 'yun. Puwede pa po 'yung madagdagan pa ng 10 million doses para sa mga LGU at private sector.

(We have already signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India for 30 million doses of Novavax. We have already secured that. They also allotted 10 million doses in case local government units and the private sector want to avail of the vaccine.)
Galvez also said he has coordinated with the country's ambassador in India to facilitate the delivery of the Novavax vaccine.
The Philippines will also get 30 million doses from COVAX Facility, a global initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to the vaccines for poor nations, said Galvez.The first batch of vaccines from COVAX Facility may be delivered to the country by February, Galvez added.
""Nakausap namin kahapon ang COVAX Facility, may possibility po na February po magdala po ang COVAX dito, WHO at saka Unicef, ng Pfizer,"" Galvez said.

MANILA-- Barangays (villages) with the highest number of coronavirus infections will serve as the primary recruitment hub for the Philippines' clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines as the government prepares to test vaccine candidates on Filipinos.
The Philippines will prioritize vaccine trials under the World Health Organization Solidarity Trial program, the government's pandemic task force said in a resolution dated Sept. 3.
Manila has ongoing vaccine discussions with Beijing and Moscow, with Russia's COVID-19 vaccine already approved for human clinical trials in the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte even volunteered himself to be inoculated in public with the Russian drug.
Phase 3 human clinical trials are large-scale testing to check the efficacy and safety of vaccines on thousands of people. It is often the last step before a vaccine gets regulatory approval from the country.

Authorities will ""recruit"" volunteers for vaccine clinical trials from the top five villages reporting the highest number of COVID-19 cases based on attack rates per 1,000-population per barangay, Science Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña said on Monday.
""Importante po ito kasi gusto nating ma-testing iyong kagalingan ng vaccine or iyong efficacy. Kaya iyon ay iti-testing natin doon sa lugar na mataas ang cases ng COVID-19,"" he said in a Palace press briefing.
(This is important because we want to test the efficacy of vaccines in areas where there are high cases of COVID-19.)
The villages with the highest number of coronavirus infections will be identified based on data from the Department of Health's Epidemiology Bureau. The said office will also manage the database on information on clinical trials once these begin.
Temporary residents are discouraged from volunteering for the clinical trials unless they could show proof that they will be staying in the area of the trial site for the next two years since participants need to be monitored after inoculation.
Trial sites will be at the barangay level, and randomization will be by households, Dela Peña said.
In the event that participants in a certain barangay are not enough, Dela Peña said the government could recruit in adjacent villages that also report high COVID-19 infections.
HOW WILL PRIVATE COMPANIES RUN VACCINE TRIALS?
Private vaccine companies that need to run human clinical trials will be assigned separate trial zones ""such that they are equally and rationally distributed to avoid competition in subject recruitment.""
In cases of outbreaks in select areas, clinical vaccine trials can be conducted in such places as long as there are facilities for the storage of vaccines, Dela Peña said.
""In that case, iyong halimbawang kulang pa rin ay puwede silang pumunta sa adjacent barangays,"" he said.
(In that case, the deficit can be fulfilled from adjacent barangays.)
For transparency purposes, the government's pandemic task force recommended a memorandum of agreement between the Department of Science and Techonology, and the Department of the Interior and Local Government.
Dela Peña said the science department has also prepared a communication plan for the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials to help the public understand the project better.",abscbn

MANILA - A public health expert said Tuesday he doesn't expect a COVID-19 vaccine to be available in the Philippines until the second quarter of 2021, urging the public to take coronavirus precautions more seriously.
Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, tempered hopes that a safe and effective vaccine against the respiratory illness could be ready for use within the year.""Base sa nalalaman namin at sa mga datos na available, hindi po yata, kung Pilipinas ang pag-uusapan, sa Pilipinas magkakaroon ng bakuna by December, mukhang sa ngayon po ay malabo po 'yun na mangyari,"" he told Teleradyo's ""SRO"" when asked after President Rodrigo Duterte earlier said a COVID-19 vaccine could be made available by December.

""Ang nakikita po naming mangyari, kung sa Pilipinas ang pag-uusapan, ang pinakamaaga na magkakaroon tayo ng bakuna na puwede ng gamitin, na naaprubahan na ng FDA (Food and Drug Administration), ay second quarter of next year,"" Montoya added.
There are currently no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Drugmakers around the world are racing to find cure to curb COVID-19, which has sickened more than 27 million people and killed over 890,000 since emerging in China.
If such a vaccine can then become available for public use, the Philippine government can obtain some 20 percent of its total demand through COVAX, Montoya said.
COVAX, led by Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the World Health Organization (WHO), is a global initiative working with governments and manufacturers to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available worldwide to both higher-income and lower-income countries.
The COVID-19 vaccine is likely to be priced between P500 to P1,000 per shot if approved, Montoya said. Two doses of the vaccine could be given per person between 20 to 28 days apart, he added.
The infectious disease specialist also assured the public that the government has already allocated funds to procure the vaccine once it becomes available.
Asked how much of the population should be vaccinated to ensure herd immunity, Montoya said at least 60 percent.
""Kapag 60 percent ng population ay immune or protected by vaccine, titigil o babagal ang transmission ng virus,"" he said.
Confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines reached 241,987 on Tuesday, as the Department of Health (DOH) reported 3,281 additional infections.
The nationwide caseload included 3,916 fatalities, 185,178 recoveries and 52,893 active cases.

The deal to secure about 10 million doses of Pfizer vaccine was brokered by Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr. and Philippine envoy to US Jose Manuel Romualdez as early as July.Instead, the supplies went to Singapore, all because of Duque's lack of urgency, they alleged.

MANILA— A COVID-19 vaccine candidate from China's Sinovac firm has passed a preliminary review by local experts and filed Thursday its application to hold clinical trials in the Philippines, the Food and Drug Administration said.The expert panel ""endorsed positively"" the Sinovac vaccine after reviewing its safety profile, effect, and study design, said FDA Director General Eric Domingo.Sinovac needs to submit additional information on the vaccine, its labeling details, and translation of related certificates. The FDA will then take 2 to 3 weeks to study these documents, he said.""Dadaan po ito ngayon sa regulatory review, at saka technical review dito po sa FDA at saka sa mga grupo rin po ng ating eksperto.

It is the first set of results of Sinovac's Phase 3 global trials, which are also being conducted in Turkey and Indonesia.
Vaccines are considered essential to curb the rampaging virus, which has killed over 1 million people globally.
Experts have warned that the safety of inactivated coronavirus vaccine candidates should be observed over longer periods, as some other inactivated vaccines had led to disease enhancement effect, where vaccine-triggered antibodies, instead of offering protection, could worsen infections when people became exposed to a virus after inoculation.
Sinovac, a Beijing-based company, said more than 10,000 people in Beijing had been injected with its vaccine. Separately, it said nearly all its employees — around 3,000 in total — and their families had taken it.

MANILA — The Philippines is ready to launch its COVID-19 vaccination drive next week, Malacañang said on Monday, as the country awaited its supply of doses.
The country's first COVID-19 vaccine batch will arrive in ""mid-February"" from the COVAX Facility, which seeks to ensure equitable access to the drug, said Palace spokesman Harry Roque.""Ilang tulog na lang, mga kaibigan, at dadating na ang unang batch ng ating bakuna. Ready or not, handang-handa po ang ating gobyerno para magsimula ang ating vaccination drive itong a-15 ng Pebrero,"" he told reporters in an online briefing.
(Just a few more nights of sleep, friends, and the first batch of our vaccine will arrive. Our government is very prepared for our vaccination drive to start this Feb. 15.)
Later asked to clarify if the inoculations would start on Feb. 15, Roque said, ""If it (vaccine batch) arrives--and we only need a day or 2 naman to start the vaccination, we will proceed.""""It's just a matter of when the plane carrying the Pfizer vaccines will actually land in NAIA (Ninoy Aquino International Airport),"" he added.Video courtesy of PTV
The Philippines has more than 537,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, among the highest in Asia. It has trailed regional peers in securing vaccines, with which the government hopes to inoculate up to 70 million people or two-thirds of the population this year.
The country will get some 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the global alliance COVAX Facility in the first quarter, including 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine expected to arrive by the third week of February, said vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.
""Sa best case scenario po, kung meron po tayong enough supply at naging successful ang negotiation natin, by December, kaya po natin 50 to 70 million,"" Galvez told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo on Sunday.
""Kung magkakaroon po tayo ng shortage ng supply, worst case scenario po natin, middle of 2022 po,"" he added.
(Our best case scenario, if we have enough supply and our negotiations are successful, by December, we can inoculate 50 to 70 million. If we encounter a shortage, our worst case scenario is middle of 2022.)

MANILA — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Monday said it has allocated $25 million or around P1.2 billion to help the Philippine government purchase COVID-19 vaccines this year.
ADB said the money will allow the Philippine government to pay vaccine manufacturers in advance to secure the delivery of vaccines to its citizens.“Vaccination is the next critical step to protect lives and promote livelihood opportunities,” said ADB President Masatsugu Asakawa.“We stand ready to support the government in these unprecedented times and help the economy navigate back to its pre-pandemic growth path,” he added.Of the P82.5 billion budget that the Philippines needs to provide vaccines to around 55 percent of the population, P70 billion will be sourced from loans.
More than 2,000 new COVID-19 cases confirmed, tally now at 525,618
Since reporting its first COVID-19 case in January last year--a Chinese woman who has traveled from Wuhan in China, the Philippines has seen more than half a million cases of the disease.
ADB said the Philippine government’s vaccine supply contracts with it, including direct payments by ADB to vaccine manufacturers, will follow the multilateral lender's procurement rules and guidelines, and ADB’s anti-corruption and integrity policy.In December last year, the Philippines said it was seeking $325 million (P15.6 billion) more in loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to finance its planned 60 million COVID-19 vaccine roll out in 2021.

MANILA — The Philippines can take loans to procure vaccines against the novel coronavirus, Malacañang said Monday, following criticisms on supposedly inadequate funding for the inoculation drive next year.Vice President Leni Robredo's camp said over the weekend that there seemed to be “no sense of urgency” in the COVID-19 inoculation, given that Sen. Franklin Drilon said that out of the P72.5 billion allotted for vaccines in the national budget, only P2.5 billion had been guaranteed.""Sen. Drilon, Vice President, malayo pa po ang eleksyon. Itigil ang pulitika,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in an online press briefing.(The election is still far away. Stop the politics.)
""Paulit-ulit na po sinabi natin 'yan, na tayo po ay makakautang na sa multilateral sources, bilateral sources para po sa [P]72.5 billion na kakailanganin,"" he said.(We have repeatedly said that we can get a loan from multilateral sources, bilateral sources for the 72.5 billion that will be needed.)

The ""fund manager and procurement agent"" for the Philippines' vaccine supply will be the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to ensure that the process is transparent and free of corruption, said National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr.The Philippines will use $1 billion from the ADB and borrow more funds from local state banks and corporations for advance market commitments for COVID-19 vaccines, which need to be secured by December and January, he said.
If the 2021 budget that might be released in March is used to get advance deals, ""we will be at the tail-end of the supply chain,"" said Galvez, who is also the country's vaccine czar.The national budget will instead be used for ""consumables"" like syringes and ""mobilization,"" he said.

The DOH now hopes to vaccinate some 50 to 60 percent of the population from the original plan of 20 percent. Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the government plans to prioritize certain sectors before reaching the whole expanded coverage.
""We are still working on that. The President has given the priorities as discussed with the Secretary of Health and our vaccine czar. We are going to finalize our prioritization over the weekend,"" she told ANC's Headstart.
""We will be prioritizing specific populations first and then we can be able to roll it out and hopefully we can achieve this 60 percent of the population,"" she said.
As herd immunity may only be possible with about 50 to 60 percent of the population vaccinated, Vergeire said the public must continue observing minimum health standards to stem the transmission of the virus.
The department will also ensure transparency in its COVID-19 vaccination program as lawmakers seek additional funding for it, she said.
Vergeire said the increase in budget allocation to procure the vaccines will depend on which vaccine is chosen.Sen. Ralph Recto is the latest legislator to propose an increased budget for COVID-19 vaccination, which is currently pegged at P8 billion. He suggested P20 billion to be allocated for the delivery of the vaccine, and another P20 billion to be placed as unprogrammed appropriations.

""We are in a pandemic and everybody’s lives are at stake. Government is trying to ensure that whatever money we put in this basket for the vaccine and whatever response we have for COVID-19 will be used diligently, will be used appropriately and that corruption will not be there,"" she said when asked about the unprogrammed budget.
Vergeire also noted that the Philippines will partner with multilateral organizations, such as the Asian Development Bank, so that the country would not be solely funding the needed technologies.
""We would like to be as transparent as possible so that people will know that we are going to use this money and it’s going to go for the appropriate technology for everybody’s benefit,"" she said.

US-based drug manufacturer Pfizer said the COVID-19 vaccine it developed with its German partner BioNTech SE showed 95% efficacy in the final results from the late-stage trial. The experimental drug from Moderna Inc. also showed roughly the same effectivity rate.
Pfizer ends COVID-19 trial with 95% efficacy, to seek emergency-use authorization
Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19
However, storage and delivery are now a concern as the Pfizer-produced drug has to be kept at -70 degrees Celsius for long-term storage, while Moderna's version must stay at -20 degrees Celsius if kept for 60 days and 2-8 degrees for 30 days.
Coronavirus: the cold, hard challenge of delivering vaccines
Vergeire said vaccines are ""still under development"" and the DOH is still awaiting results of the trials, specifically information on ""how long the antibodies will last when you are vaccinated with this type of vaccine.""
For the vaccines to be used in the Philippines, it must first be assessed by a panel of experts, then an ethics board, and then the Food and Drug Administration. ",abscbn

Thomas Peter, Reuters/File
MANILA (UPDATE) — The Food and Drug Administration has granted an emergency use authorization for the COVID-19 vaccine of China's Sinovac Biotech, paving the way for its delivery to the Philippines, an official said Monday.
“After a thorough and rigorous review of the currently available published and unpublished data by our regulatory and medical experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine of Sinovac Life Sciences Company, known as SARS-CoV-2 vaccine Vero Cell Inactivated, o yung trade name nya ay CoronaVac,"" FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
""The benefit of using the vaccine outweighs the known and potential risk,” he added.
Domingo said that interim data from Sinovac show the vaccine has an efficacy rate on patients aged 18 to 59 years of 65.3%, based on trials in Indonesia, and up to 91.2% based on trials done in Turkey.
“However, it has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4% when used on health care workers exposed to COVID-19. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this group,” the official said.
3 TO 5 DAYS
Before the announcement, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said during the same briefing that China’s Sinovac is the COVID-19 vaccine brand likely to arrive in the Philippines before the month ends.

“Malamang, Sinovac po yan ang posibleng dumating na 600,000 doses (Sinovac’s 600,000 doses is likely to arrive). Good for 300,000 individuals,” Duque said.He said that once the EUA is released, it will only take 3 to 5 days for the Chinese Embassy to prepare the shipment of the vaccines.
This is the third COVID-19 vaccine product that has received an EUA in the Philippines, following those developed by Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

Palace spokesman Harry Roque earlier said 600,000 Beijing-donated Sinovac shots would arrive on Feb. 23. He said 100,000 of these doses would go to the military, and the rest to health workers.
However, Roque later said that the lack of an EUA might delay the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines.
MILD TO MODERATE SIDE EFFECTS
Domingo said experts recommend two equal and standard doses of 0.5 mL each, given 4 weeks apart, for patients receiving Sinovac's vaccine.
“The adverse events reported were transient and mostly mild to moderate similar to common vaccine reactions,"" he said.
""No specific safety concerns were identified. But it must be noted that this only reflects limited follow-up, and more adverse effects may emerge that’s why close surveillance and monitoring is needed after the immunization,” he added.
Besides being certified Halal by Indonesia, Domingo said Sinovac is a “good option for individuals who have allergies to components of other available vaccines such as the polyethylene glycol and polysorbate.”
The 2 ingredients are said to cause anaphylaxis and severe allergies, although such effects were very rare.
Polyethylene glycol is said to be among the ingredients of mRNA vaccines like that of Pfizer’s, while polysorbate is said to be in viral vector vaccines.
Before Sinovac’s EUA was approved, the government was expecting Pfizer to send the first batch of doses through the COVAX Facility.But the shipment was delayed due to a pending indemnification agreement. The Philippine government said it already signed the agreement with COVAX, but the World Health Organization, which is a member of COVAX Facility, said it is still waiting a separate indemnification deal from Pfizer.

Clinical trials are different from the anticipated vaccine rollout since the former involves vaccines that have yet to be approved for emergency use.During a virtual townhall with health workers on Monday, Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD) Director Jaime Montoya explained that clinical trials are being done to see if a COVID-19 vaccine is safe and effective for Filipinos.This will “ensure a shorter and easier route of registration with the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA),” he explained.
So far, the FDA has approved clinical trial applications of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen, Clover Biopharmaceuticals and Sinovac from China.

For WHO’s multi-country trial, which will involve the testing of several candidate vaccines, the Philippines already committed 15,000 volunteers. It is unclear how many volunteers are expected for the above mentioned independent trials. There are also no definite dates yet for the start of the various trials although the government is just awaiting the organizers’ go signal.READ: Wanted: Volunteers for COVID-19 vaccine trials in Metro Manila
For those who may be interested in volunteering, here’s what you need to know:
SCREENING AND FOLLOW-UP
Only those 18 years old and up, without any illness, can participate in a vaccine clinical trial. He or she will also be asked to sign an informed consent form before joining the trial.
The risks and benefits of the trial will be carefully explained to the participant. Among the possible risks is that the vaccine won’t work and that it might have side effects.
According to Montoya, volunteers from the pre-picked areas will be screened.This includes a short physical exam and a review of medical history. Upon enrollment into the trial, the participant will also be given a schedule of his follow-up visits.
Montoya said the follow-up visits after the actual vaccination will involve assessment of the participant’s health and depending on the brand, a 2nd dose.
“During the conduct of the clinical trial, participants are also monitored to ensure their safety,” Montoya said.
The participant will be monitored for 6 to 18 months after vaccination.
PLACEBO OR NO TREATMENT
To test if a vaccine is effective, a portion of the volunteers in each trial will be given the candidate vaccine while the other group will be given a placebo or another vaccine.Asked if it is still ethical to use a placebo, which is usually water with salt, when there are COVID-19 vaccines already approved for emergency use, Dr. Cristina Torres of the Forum for Ethical Research Committee in Asia and Western Pacific Region said the WHO might end up only assigning a fewer number of volunteers for placebo.
On the other hand, she said the vaccines are just approved for emergency use and have yet to receive a certificate for product registration.“Lahat sila ay experimental pa lamang. Kasi nga may emergency use authorization,” she said.Montoya also said the WHO continues to engage with their group of ethicists and they might change their protocol from using a placebo to another COVID-19 vaccine to serve as a benchmark or comparison.
COMPENSATION
For their time devoted to the study, volunteers may receive compensation, according to Torres.
“Hindi ko alam kung sa WHO clinical trial meron silang tatanggapin. Subalit kung ang isang sponsor ay pharmaceutical company, standard operating procedure po yan na ang kalahok ay may tatanggapin,” she explained.
(I do not know about the WHO clinical trial if volunteers will receive anything. But if the sponsor is a pharmaceutical company, it’s standard operating procedure that the volunteer should receive something.)
In the slide presented by Torres, she showed a sample computation of P500 for loss of time and P200 for transportation expenses after each visit.
Montoya previously told ABS-CBN News that the compensation is meant to cover for the volunteer’s possible loss of earnings for the day. It compensation should not be too high that it would be considered “undue inducement.”
“Undue inducement” in research is defined as an attractive offer that may lead people to do something that would normally have objections to. This raises ethical concerns.If the volunteer will not receive anything, the research group will inform him or her that they will only give the vaccine in exchange for participation.TREATMENT AFTER VACCINATION
“At kung sakaling mapinsala, even if it’s WHO, will cover treatment of all study-related injury,” Torres said.
(And if there is injury, even if it’s WHO, they will cover treatment of all study-related injury.)
But Montoya said the volunteers will be given emergency treatment even if they can’t determine yet if it’s because of the vaccine.
“Kailangan tignan kayo agad, gawin ang kailangan gawin pag kayo ay nagkaroon ng side effects,” he said.
(You should be immediately checked, treat what needs to be treated if you get side effects.)
He said it will be important to see if the vaccine caused the adverse effect in case there will be a financial claim against the manufacturer.
Torres said the study’s principal investigator and the ethics committee should be easily contacted by the volunteers for any additional question or concerns.
IMMUNIZATION
And what if the volunteer wants to get vaccinated against COVID-19 through the government’s immunization program?The two doctors said the volunteers must wait until the study is over since they will have to check if the vaccine really did have an effect.
Even for those who received a placebo, it will be impossible to know that they did not get an actual vaccine.
Montoya said the details of the study, which ones received the placebo and which ones received the vaccine, won’t be known until the recruitment and the study is ongoing.
For now, there are still no details on how people can volunteer for the trials since the trial sites will need to be finalized and announced by the WHO and the other pharmaceutical companies. Montoya said they will ensure that the clinical trial sites won’t overlap with each other and withof the government’s vaccination program.

MANILA — The Philippines will receive up to 40 million COVID-19 vaccine doses for free from the COVAX initiative, an official leading the country's inoculation drive said on Thursday.Led by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance, the global COVAX initiative aims to ensure equal distribution of vaccines against the deadly virus.Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez said he has seen a ""confirmation of participation"" in the COVAX scheme.""Ikinagagalak ko pong ibalita na ang ating COVAX Facility para sa Pilipinas ay naaprubahan na po.

It includes the possibility of ensuring that we will have 30 to 40 million doses for free, for all our compatriots.)
Vaccines from COVAX will include those developed by US-based Pfizer and Johnson&Johnson, British drugs group AstraZeneca, and Covovax from the Serum Institute of India, said Galvez.
The first vaccine batch will arrive in the country in February, he said.""Sa ngayon, wala pa po tayong definite kung ano pong vaccine ang mauunang i-deploy, but most likely iyong Pfizer.""
(For now, we have no definite info on which vaccine will arrive first, but it will most likely be Pfizer.)

These will be on top the 148 million vaccine doses that the Philippines is hoping to secure this January, he said.The government aims to begin immunizations next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of the population, this year.

MANILA - The Philippines is aiming to complete its COVID-19 vaccination program by 2023, a health official said Wednesday, amid global competition of the highly sought-after coronavirus shots.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the government had until 2023 to inoculate its targeted population in case vaccine deliveries would be delayed.
""That's why we indicated in our plan for this vaccine deployment program that it's going to be until 2023 so that we have that wide margin if in case the delivery will not be on time,"" she said in an interview on ANC.

Palace says Philippines ready to start COVID-19 vaccinations next week
The country is expected to launch its COVID-19 immunization next week as some 117,000 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech jabs may arrive on Feb. 13.
Health authorities on Tuesday conducted simulation on the arrival of the vaccines, which were transported to the cold storage facility in Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in less than an hour.
""As long as the temperatures will be maintained, the hours or the time from the airport to the storage facility will not really matter,"" she said.
Based on a novel technology that uses synthetic mRNA to activate the immune system against the virus, the Pfizer/BioNTech needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below -- equivalent to an Antarctic winter.
In the government's vaccination plan, health workers shall first receive the COVID-19 jabs. They are followed by older people, persons with comorbidities or underlying conditions, other essential workers, including uniformed personnel, and indigent population -- all in group A.
Next in the priority list is group B, which are other frontline workers and special population. The remaining population or group C is at the bottom of the pile.
The Philippines aims to vaccinate up to 70 million people against COVID-19 this year to achieve herd immunity.
It is working to lock in 148 million doses from various drug makers, on top of 5.6 million shots that will come from the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to the vaccines.

MANILA — Frontline health workers both in the public and private sectors, senior citizens, and poor Filipinos are among those prioritized to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 under the current proposal of the government, an official from the Department of Health (DOH) had said.
At a hearing last week by the House Committee on People's Participation, DOH Bureau of International Health Cooperation’s Dr. Aleli Annie Sudiacal said that while the goal is to have every Filipino inoculated, the first part of the program proposes to cover only some 24.7 million Filipinos.
They are the ones covered in the top 5 priority groups.
In her presentation to lawmakers, Sudiacal said the country's 1,762,994 frontline health workers are the first priority for the coronavirus vaccine, once available.
These include:private and public health workers working in treatment and rehabilitation centers, COVID-19 treatment and monitoring facilities, hospitals (612,975)
other public health workers, like those in rural, city and provincial health offices, those on the field, and local government contact tracers (602,982)
barangay health workers including BHERTS (414,640)
other frontline workers in other national government agencies, like DSWD, DepEd, DILG, BJMP and Bureau of Corrections (132,397)
Indigent senior citizens, numbering 3,789,874, are prioritized second. Sudiacal described this population as one of the most vulnerable.
Senior citizens not under the indigent category, numbering 5,678,544, make up the third priority group for the vaccine.
The 12,911,193 remaining members of the indigent population are the fourth in the priority eligible groups.
Comprising the fifth priority group are the government’s 525,523 uniformed personnel, including from the Philippine National Police, Armed Forces of the Philippines, Philippine Coast Guard, Bureau of Fire Protection, and the Citizen Armed Force Geographical Unit.

Sudiacal said the primary objectives of the National Deployment and Vaccination Plan being finalized by the DOH, which identified the population priority list for the phased implementation program of the immunization program, are to directly reduce morbidity and mortality, and maintain the operations of most essential and critical services.
""Our secondary goal with this plan is to substantially control transmission, and minimize disruption of social and economic functions,"" she added.
On Wednesday, Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr., chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and the country's vaccine czar, said 35 million Filipinos are on the priority list, although he did not provide a breakdown.

Last week, Duterte approved advance payment to private vaccine developers to ensure that the Philippines would get a supply of the drug. He is also set to authorize emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines, according to Malacañang.

“It (Sinovac vaccine delivery) will be stored until such time that it is approved. If it is not issued an EUA, then it will be sent back,” Roque said.

Its first case, recorded on Jan. 30 last year, involved a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged. Her companion, a 44-year-old Chinese man, is the second case who succumbed to the disease on Feb. 1 last year, marking the first coronavirus-related death outside China and in the Philippines.

DOH: Galvez to expedite procurement, rollout of COVID-19 vaccine
Why is COVID-19 vaccine czar an ex-general? 'Managerial skills' needed, says Palace
The government is looking to place an advance procurement of about 24 million vaccines within the first quarter of next year, said Galvez. The initial batch of vaccines will be for frontliners, indigents, and the vulnerable sectors, he said.
The inoculation rollout will largely depend on the financing, development and approval of the vaccines, he said.
""If everything will go well, ang mangyayari po is earliest is May,"" he told ANC's Headstart when asked about the vaccination timeline.
Should there be roadblocks on supply and demand, the earliest that the program may begin is by the end of 2021, he said.

The country has a ""standby fund,"" which will enable the procurement ""over and above"" what could be allocated in next year's budget as approved by Congress, said Galvez.
The Department of Health on Wednesday reported 987 additional COVID-19 cases, the lowest recorded daily tally in almost 4 months. This brings the country’s total confirmed cases to 388,137.

The pandemic task force also approved the corresponding allocation of funds for the country's participation in the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said.
The World Health Organization has described the facility as a ""mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.""
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said that COVAX is under the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT)-Accelerator, a global collaboration to speed up the development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, tests and treatments.
It involves not just government institutions but also private sector, civil society and the academe. Among the organizations participating are the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.
“Kapag fully financed na po ang COVAX, maaari nitong bigyan ang lahat ng participating governments (tulad ng Pilipinas) ng naaayon na share oras na magkaroon ng matagumpay na vaccine production,” Vergeire said during a televised briefing on Friday.
(Once COVAX is fully financed, it can give participating governments like the Philippines its corresponding share once vaccine production succeeds.)
Over 150 countries have joined the facility that aims to deliver 2 billion doses of safe and effective vaccines that would have passed regulatory approval by the end of 2021.
""These vaccines will be delivered equally to all participating countries, proportional to their populations, initially prioritizing health care workers then expanding to cover 20 percent of the population of participating countries,"" the WHO had said.
Later distribution of a vaccine would depend on a country's need, vulnerability, and the threat of the virus, according to the WHO.
While the world has yet to find a vaccine for the rapidly-spreading virus, scientists worldwide have reported progress on different studies for a potential drug.
As of July 23, the Philippines has recorded 74,390 confirmed COVID-19 infections, 48,136 of which are active cases.

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines may start inoculating its citizens with the vaccine against COVID-19 around March or April next year, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Monday.
""We’ve done some scenario analysis under the leadership of Sec. (Carlito Jr) Galvez and I think the best case scenario would be about the end of the first quarter of 2021 or about the start of second quarter of next year,"" he told ANC's Headstart when asked when the inoculation may begin.
""A lot of factors will have to be taken into consideration to be able to more definitively set schedules for actual distribution, deployment, and inoculation of our people within our priority list,"" he said.
Duque said government is looking to build a portfolio of different vaccines, depending on the availability and evaluation of a panel of experts.
He said in the list are those from Sinovac, Gamaleya, AstraZeneca, Sinopharm, and Johnson & Johnson. Vaccines from these companies ""require a much less sophisticated and a bit higher cold storage temperature.""
Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine demands -70 degrees celsius storage, which the Philippines does not have at the moment, said Duque. However, he said he heard from Galvez that the company ""might be willing to provide"" the storage facility to ensure the vaccine's effectivity.

The distribution then would depend on the requirement of each vaccine that will be rolled out, said Duque. Since the country has been doing vaccination drives for decades, it will ""piggyback"" on existing systems, he said.
""We need to enhance the capacity because there has never been in the history (a time when we had to vaccinate) a huge number of people, at 60 to 70 million people. It will take time to do it,"" he said.
The government will also need to train more people to do the inoculation in a larger scale, he said.
He added, some P13.2 billion has been earmarked for peripheral costs of vaccination, such as the purchase of syringes and waste disposal.

The government is hoping to inoculate about 50 to 60 percent of the country's population to achieve herd immunity from COVID-19.

MANILA — Multinational firm AstraZeneca has officially submitted to the Philippine government its application for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine, an official said Wednesday.
“Yes. They filed the application just now,” Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo told ABS-CBN News.
“The processing and evaluation will take 3 to 4 weeks, depending on the completeness of their submission,” he added.
Domingo said earlier in the day that AstraZeneca aimed to apply in the next few days.

MANILA - The Philippines is set to apply for an additional 900,000 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines from the COVAX Facility, the country’s vaccine czar said Wednesday.
This is on top of the 117,000 initial doses of Pfizer vaccines that the Philippines is set to receive from the initiative that aims to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, National Task Force on COVID-19 chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez said in a public briefing.“Gumagawa po kami ng sulat... if we can have submission for additional more than 900,000 to make it 1 million iyong ating vaccine sa Pfizer, ay gagawin po namin iyon,” he said.
(We are making a letter... that if we can have an additional more than 900,000 to 1 million vaccines from Pfizer, we will do it.)
“We are now preparing the letter and we will submit it before Feb. 14 and additionally, ongoing pa rin naman po iyong ating negotiations with Pfizer (our negotiations with Pfizer are still ongoing),"" Galvez added.
Aside from the US-based drugmaker, the Philippines is set to receive at least 5.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, also through the COVAX facility, from British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca within the first quarter of the year.
“Napakahalaga po ng bakunang ito mula sa COVAX sapagkat mabibigyan natin ng prayoridad ang ating mga health workers at frontliners base sa sektoral at geographical na strategy ng ating national vaccine and development plan,” Galvez said.(These vaccines from COVAX are extremely important since we can prioritize our health workers and frontliners, based on the sectoral and geographical strategy of our national vaccine and development plan.)
The country's Food and Drug Administration has previously granted emergency use authorization for both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.
The Philippine government also signed term sheets with at least 3 other vaccine companies, including Moderna, Sinovac and Novavax, bringing the country's supply for inoculation to some 108 million COVID-19 vaccine doses. Details of the supply agreements are expected to be finalized this February, Galvez had said.

MANILA (UPDATE) — The Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines on Wednesday said it might release its decision on the emergency use application (EUA) of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine by January 14.
“Kahapon, nagbigay ng konting katanungan yung ating mga eksperto na pinadala natin sa sa Pfizer. At binigyan ko sila ng 48 hours to reply and give the information requested by our panel. Pagkatapos nun, ibabalik sa akin ng January 10.

Domingo’s slide presentation showing the timeline for Pfizer indicated January 14 as the date estimated for the FDA’s decision on Pfizer’s EUA application.
On Wednesday afternoon, Domingo told media that Europe-based multinational firm AstraZeneca has finally applied for EUA.
READ: AstraZeneca applies for emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines
Besides having a tripartite supply deal with the private sector and the Philippine government, AstraZeneca is also in talks with local government units looking to procure their own vaccine supply.
Domingo's pronouncements come as nations across the world began inoculating their population to quash fresh infections.
In an interview earlier in the day on ANC, Domingo, referring to the vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, said, ""We are not taking long while waiting. And believe me, we are making this as quick as possible. And I'm quite sure, we'll be out with the authorization within a week. That is quite short if you compare to other countries.""
Pfizer and BioNTech’s candidate vaccine were among the first to declare its efficacy rate against COVID-19. With an efficacy rate of 95 percent, their vaccine was soon approved for emergency use by the United States and the United Kingdom.
Its application for EUA in the Philippines was made on Dec. 23, and evaluation started on Dec. 28, Domingo said.
Unfortunately, vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez said during the same forum that the supply from Pfizer might not arrive immediately.“Nakikita natin ang Pfizer ang most in demand na brand. Most likely magiging available po ito ng Q3 and Q4. With the challenges that they had hindi makakayanan ang early deployment,” he said, adding that countries experiencing a spike in cases are those that are set to receive Pfizer’s next batch of vaccines.
(We are seeing that Pfizer is the most in demand brand. Most likely it will be available in the 3rd or 4th quarter. With the challenges that they had, they can’t do early deployment.)
Domingo revealed that China's Sinovac and Russia's Gamaleya Institute had already asked for requirements for a possible emergency use of their vaccines in the country.
China's Sinopharm and US' Moderna have yet to contact the FDA, he added.
Should the Philippines grant its first emergency use for a COVID-19 vaccine, Domingo said health authorities were already preparing for the procurement of the vaccine.
""Everything's being prepared. Everything's being ready for the rollout but securing the actual vaccines would probably take some more time even after the EUA,"" he said.
Galvez said the government was in advance talks with Novavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Sinovac and Gamaleya and that deals might be clinched by the end of the month.

MANILA - The Philippines should start identifying specific persons from sectors that are prioritized to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Vice President Leni Robredo said Sunday.
While she approves of the prioritization being planned now for those to be inoculated when the vaccine arrives in the country, Robredo said she suggested that specific names be collated during the waiting period now.
“Halimbawa, health care workers. Dapat alam na natin, ilan ba sila, sino sila? Para ‘pag dumating, meron nang recipient. Hindi yung gawin natin yung listahan ‘pag nandiyan na yung vaccine,” Robredo said.

(My suggestion is, we go by individuals already.)
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said last week that the Philippines will have access to the coronavirus vaccine of the United States after Moderna and Pfizer announced the more than 90-percent efficacy of their respective products.
""We have firm commitments from the United States... that we will have access po to COVID vaccines that may be developed in the United States,"" Roque said, disclosing that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo relayed this information to Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr.

The Department of Health said first in the priority to receive the COVID-19 vaccine are frontline health workers, numbering over 1.7 million.
They are followed by indigent senior citizens (over 3.7 million), remaining senior citizens (over 5.6 million), remaining indigent population (nearly 13 million), and uniformed personnel (over half a million).
Robredo said the data can be collated from local government units.
Officials project the first batch of COVID-19 vaccine to arrive in the country by the second quarter of 2021.
As of Saturday, the Philippines has recovered nearly 417,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, of which 33,224 are active infections.

Dado Ruvic, Reuters/FileMANILA — The Philippines has completed all requirements for the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines being supplied by the COVAX Facility, a World Health Organization official said on Tuesday.
The COVAX Facility, of which WHO is a member, is an initiative that aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
“I also want to update you that the Philippines has met all the requirements necessary for accessing the AstraZeneca vaccines,” WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe said during a briefing with the Department of Health.
He confirmed around 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, which the Philippine drug regulator already approved for emergency use, have been earmarked for the country.

The government and the WHO previously said that the Philippines is set to receive AstraZeneca vaccines within the first quarter of the year.
Only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have been included in the WHO’s emergency use listing, making it easier for member countries to approve the said companies’ COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use.

“What we are now looking at is accelerating delivery of those AstraZeneca vaccines, at least a part of that shipment to the Philippines,” Abeyasinghe said.
He said Philippine officials have already signed the indemnification agreement with COVAX for the AstraZeneca vaccines.
“I understand that the Department of Health has supplied all the letters necessary to the COVAX initiative to access the early rollout of those AstraZeneca vaccines,” he said.
Unlike Pfizer, which required a separate indemnification deal with its recipient countries, Abeyasinghe said, “my understanding is that there is no requirement in the case of AstraZeneca for further exchange of letters between the manufacturer and the Philippine government.”
“We are optimistic that before the end of this week, we will hear from the COVAX initiative on likely delivery dates for AstraZeneca vaccines to the Philippines,” he said.
Asked if the Philippines is affected by the report that AstraZeneca is no longer taking additional vaccine orders, the WHO official said the Philippines’ vaccines from the COVAX Facility should not be affected.
He explained that AstraZeneca’s facility in South Korea is dedicated to exclusively manufacturing the COVAX Facility’s vaccine requirements while other countries are relying on the company’s facilities in Europe and in India.
“And what is earmarked for the Philippines will be coming from South Korea. So, we still remain optimistic that we will receive the AstraZeneca vaccines within the timeframes that we were talking about,” he said.
The Philippines was supposed to receive vaccines from Pfizer through the COVAX Facility this month. But it was delayed due to the company’s requirement for a separate indemnification agreement.
The delay pushed back the scheduled immunization for health workers, who are being prioritized by the government.

Caloocan Mayor Oscar Malapitan made the announcement through his Facebook account.
Malapitan also said the city will be able to buy not less than 600,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.
He also said the city will continue to coordinate with AstraZeneca, as well as local authorities to ensure that it will have its supply of vaccines once it has been approved for use.
San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora also said he has signed a tripartite agreement with the National Task Force against COVID-19 and AstraZeneca for the procurement of the vaccine.
San Juan has allocated P50 million for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines.
Zamora said this is enough to buy vaccines for all residents who are willing to be vaccinated.
As of Jan. 10, more than 8,300 residents of San Juan has signed up for the city's vaccination program.
Meanwhile, Vigan City Mayor Carlo Medina said the city has also signed an agreement with AstraZeneca for 100,000 to 120,000 doses of its COVID-19 vaccine.
Medina said his city aims to inoculate all Vigan residents 18 years old and above.
The province of Iloilo, represented by Gov. Arthur Defensor Jr., also signed a multilateral agreement for the advanced purchase of AstraZeneca's vaccine.
Iloilo province will initially purchase 270,000 doses of vaccines, worth a total of $1,350,000.

MANILA (UPDATE) — The Philippines has allowed emergency use of vaccines and drugs against COVID-19, 8 months into the crisis that has seen over 430,000 people infected and the economy dragged into recession due to prolonged quarantine restrictions.
President Rodrigo Duterte, in an executive order, has allowed the Food and Drug Administration to issue emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.This means that coronavirus vaccines approved by the countries where they were developed can be used locally after 21 days, down from the current required 6-month verification, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque earlier said.The authorization will be issued and remain valid “only when all of the following circumstances are present,” according to Duterte’s Executive Order No. 121.- Based on the totality of evidence available, including data from adequate and well-controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose or treat COVID-19;- The known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine when used to diagnose, prevent or treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug or vaccine, if any; and- There is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the drug or vaccine for diagnosing, preventing or treating COVID-19.When and which COVID-19 vaccines are likely to be available in Asia
The emergency use authorization “shall be valid only within the duration of the declared public health emergency due to COVID-19,” said Duterte.Applications for emergency use should “demonstrate compliance with Good Marketing Practices, and accompanied by an undertaking by the manufacturer to complete the development of the drug and vaccine.”Duterte authorized the FDA to “accept the regulatory decision” of the World Health Organization, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or other internationally recognized and established authorities.On Wednesday, Britain approved BioNTech-Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.

Suliane Favennec, AFP
MANILA — More than three-fourths, or 76% of the P82.5 billion budget targeted for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination will be coming from new foreign loans, data from the Department of Finance (DOF) show.
This translates to P62.5 billion (approximately USD1.3 billion) that the government is currently negotiating with multilateral banks, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the World Bank.
Aside from these new loans, another P2.54 billion (USD52.8 million) of the loans that the government had previously secured for COVID-19 response will be realigned toward procuring COVID-19 vaccines, according to DOF.
Nearly double in 5 months
The Philippine government has amassed a total of USD13.34 billion or approximately P640.96 billion in loans for its COVID-19 response, DOF data as of Dec. 15, 2020 show.
The amount of loans nearly doubled since July 1, 2020, when total government loans for COVID-19 response stood at USD7.73 billion (approximately P371.67 billion).
On top of this, the government is also seeking to borrow P62.5 billion for vaccine procurement from multilateral financing institutions including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and the World Bank.
Of the aggregate amount of USD5.6 billion in new loan agreements, or those that were signed from July 14 to Dec. 10, 2020, a total of USD2.85 billion will be coming from multilateral and bilateral financing institutions, while USD2.75 billion will be through the issuance of bonds. Below are the details of these new loans:
ADB: USD1.33 billion (approximately P63.67 billion) for the Competitive and Inclusive Agriculture Development Program, the Disaster Resilience Improvement Program, the Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19 Program, and the Inclusive Finance Development Program, Subprogram 2
World Bank: USD970 million (approximately P46.61 billion) for the Philippines Beneficiary FIRST Social Protection Project and the Support to Parcelization of Lands for Individual Titling Project
JICA: USD458.95 million (approximately P22.05 billion) for the Post Disaster Standby Loan (Phase 2)
KEXIM-EDCF: USD100 million (approximately P4.81 billion) for the Program Loan for COVID-19 Emergency Response Program
Issuance of bonds: USD2.75 billion (approximately P132.15 billion)
To be paid until 2049
The running total of the country’s USD13.34 billion or approximately P640.96 billion loans will be paid from 2023-2049, with an average repayment period of 15 years for each loan, based on the amortization schedules indicated in the loan agreement documents available on the DOF website as of Dec. 15.
Of the USD12.72 billion or approximately P611.41 billion for budgetary support financing, a big chunk (85%) or USD10.77 billion (approximately P517.53 billion) has already been disbursed to the government as of Dec. 15, 2020, according to DOF.
Another USD26.36 million or approximately P1.27 billion were grants from the Government of Japan and from ADB. The government did not acquire any new grants since July 2020. Realigned for vaccines
Meanwhile, a total of USD52.8 million or approximately P2.54 billion from the country’s existing loans secured last year will be realigned toward procuring COVID-19 vaccines, Finance Undersecretary Mark Dennis Joven said in a letter response to ABS-CBN’s query on the matter.
These are:
USD27.8 million (approximately P1.34 billion) of the USD100 million loan from the World Bank for the Philippines: COVID-19 Emergency Response Project (PCERP), which has already been amended; and
USD25 million (approximately P1.2 billion) of the USD125 million ADB loan, Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit (HEAL) COVID-19, which is already “under discussion.”
Target: P82.5B
The country would need P82.5 billion to “provide vaccines to around 55% of the population,” Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said last week. This translates to some 50-70 million Filipinos that the government is targeting to inoculate against COVID-19.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said that at least 60 million Filipinos need to be immunized against COVID-19 in order to attain herd immunity.
Of the P82.5 billion target budget, P70 billion will be used to fund some 140 million doses of vaccines, along with the COVAX contribution, while the remaining P12.5 billion will be used to finance rollout, storage, distribution, and other “ancillary requirements,” Undersecretary Joven said during a senate hearing last Jan. 11.
The COVAX Facility is an initiative that “brought together governments and vaccine manufacturers, including 64 high-income economies,” to guarantee fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines of participating countries.
Unprogrammed Appropriations: P70B
Of the P82.5 billion needed for vaccines, P2.5 billion has been allocated to DOH in the 2021 national budget. Another P10 billion will come from Bayanihan 2’s COVID-19 vaccination program allocation from last year. The rest of the funds for vaccine procurement, or P70 billion, is provided in the 2021 General Appropriations Act under “Unprogrammed Appropriations.”
Unprogrammed appropriations, according to the Budget Department, may be tapped when there are excess revenue collections, new revenue sources, or approved loans for foreign-assisted projects.
Dominguez earlier said that P70 billion of the target vaccine funding will be sourced from loans from multilateral lenders, the Philippines’ bilateral partners or the domestic market.
More loans
As of writing, the DOF is negotiating around P62.5 billion (approximately USD1.3 billion) through “loans with multilateral banks to procure COVID-19 vaccines,” including from the ADB, World Bank, and AIIB, Dominguez said.
“This will form part of the unprogrammed appropriations of the National Budget,” Joven said, adding that this “may also be complemented by” additional supplies through the COVAX facility,” and through private and local government partnerships. Exchange rate used is as of Jan. 8, 2021 by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas = P48.053

MANILA - Some Filipinos are looking for ways to get inoculated against COVID-19 as the government has yet to say with certainty the schedule of the availability of the vaccine against the new coronavirus in the Philippines, a health expert said Monday.
But, according to Dr. Tony Leachon, who used to be part of the inter-agency task force against COVID-19, getting the vaccine from the black market could sabotage the government's vaccination program.
Leachon told ABS-CBN News that aside from the black market, some Filipinos are also planning to travel abroad because they have a higher chance of getting the vaccine there.
""One reason is that they are actually uncertain of the exact timeline of the arrival of the vaccine,"" he said, noting that this is a ""normal behavioral response"" when the supply for a drug is limited.
""Because of the global vaccination..., siyempre, if you are a Filipino, maiinggit ka (If you are a Filipino, you'll be envious),"" he said.

Leachon said some Filipino green card holders are keen on being inoculated in the United States where the vaccines are already being rolled out.
""Some of my patients would like to go to the US this March. Iniisip nila, by that time, 'yung priority list ng America, more or less, they would go to the Phase 2. So, baka makakuha sila doon, lalo na kung green card holder yung iba,"" he said.
(They think that by that time, the US will already be in the Phase 2 of their priority list. So maybe they can get vaccines there, especially if they are green card holders.)
""'Yung iba, gusto pumunta ng Singapore... kasi dumating na yung sa Singapore at mas malapit ang Singapore,"" he said.
(Others want to go to Singapore... because the vaccines have arrived in Singapore and it's closer to the Philippines.)
Singapore gets Asia's first batch of Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine
Philippine Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said the country would begin its inoculation program for high-risk individuals and poor families in March.
As of Monday, the Philippines has yet to approve the use and sale of any COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
ADVANTAGE OF THE WEALTHY AND PRIVILEGED
Despite the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) frequent reminder that it is illegal to receive vaccines that have yet to receive government approval, several soldiers and members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) have already been inoculated against COVID-19.
Palace tells public: Just accept that some soldiers were vaccinated vs COVID-19
Unauthorized use of COVID-19 vaccine illegal, FDA says after Duterte's PSG inoculated
Sen. Panfilo Lacson and House Majority Leader Martin Romualdez were earlier reported to have received the vaccine this year, but both lawmakers have neither confirmed nor denied the allegations.
This is not the first time the rich and the privileged secured COVID-19-related items ahead of those who need it more, Leachon said.
""It happened already during the first few months of the (COVID-19) laboratory testing,"" he said.
""There were limited supplies of the test kits. At that time, 2,000 kits lang (only). We heard real stories na (that) some politicians or influential persons na naka-una dun sa testing, rather than 'yung mga naka-admit (were tested first, rather than those who were admitted in hospitals),"" he said.
""It's a natural phenomenon, if you are rich and you wouldn't mind the cost of the vaccine.""
DOH explains why President, other officials tested for COVID-19 amid kit shortage
Getting the vaccine early or late for one or two people does not matter, Leachon said, noting that herd immunity against COVID-19 can only be achieved when more than half of the population have been inoculated.
""Pangmaramihan siya magiging effective... kaya natin ginawang mass vaccination in order to achieve herd immunity,"" he said.
(It needs to be administered to a lot of people for it to be effective... That's why we want a mass vaccination in order to achieve herd immunity.)
""Akala mo protected ka, pero mas mae-enhance ang protection mo kung mas marami ang mababakunahan.""
(You think you are protected. But your protection can only be enhanced when more people are vaccinated.)
INDIVIDUAL INOCULATION MAY 'SABOTAGE' PH'S COVID-19 VACCINE PROGRAM
Filipinos who are trying to get inoculated against COVID-19 on their own may end up ""sabotaging"" the Philippines' COVID-19 inoculation program, Leachon warned.
""That only problem is the black market because you don't know the efficacy and safety of the particular vaccine,"" he said.
Vaccinations done without the government's permission may ""skew"" the data on whether or not the Philippines has already vaccinated 60 percent of its population, the number needed for the country to develop herd immunity against COVID-19.
""You would not know right now who are the patients that would be given double vaccination,"" Leachon said.
""At this point in time, we do not know the effect of double vaccination... or an overdose,"" he added.
He said those who receive the vaccines from unregistered sources may end up experiencing ""unpredictable adverse events"" which may discourage other Filipinos from availing of the vaccine from the government.
""[It] may actually lead to a sabotage of the national program of the government, considering the low acceptability of the Filipinos to vaccination,"" he said.
The ""delay"" in the Philippines' procurement of the COVID-19 vaccine ""created"" the mad rush for some Filipinos to source vaccines on their own, he said.
The Philippines was supposed to get some 10 million doses from US-based pharmaceutical giant Pfizer as early as January 2021, but Duque's failure to submit documentary requirements on time botched the initial deal, Lacson earlier said.
Duque said talks with Pfizer are still on going, with FDA hoping to authorize the use of the company's vaccines in the country next month.
PH’s FDA hopes to issue emergency use authorization for Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine by Jan.
Aside from speeding up its vaccine procurement, the government should intensify its education and awareness programs about the COVID-19 vaccine, Leachon advised.
""Kailangan meron tayong structured education to the public to explain and ilagay din yung penalties for doing that (illegal procurement),"" he said.
(There should be a structured education to the public to explain it, and included in that is a list of penalties for the illegal procurement of vaccines.)
""Sasabihin din ng FDA at DOH na unwarranted or illegal vaccination of these products may result to lack of efficacy and adverse events. So you put them in a position that they will not do that kasi matatakot sila,"" he said.
(The FDA and the DOH should also notify the public that unwarranted or illegal vaccination using these products may result to lack of efficacy and adverse events. So you put them in a position that they will not do that because they are afraid of the repercussions.)
The efficacy rate and what it really means
Where are we in the COVID-19 vaccine race?
The 2021 national budget includes PhP72.5 billion for the purchase, storage, transportation and distribution of vaccines against COVID-19, according to President Rodrigo Duterte. It is expected to cover the inoculation of the poorest families, elderly, and other high-risk individuals.
Congress is pushing to pass a new aid package next year to boost the Philippines' vaccine fund to hopefully hasten the return of normalcy in the country.

MANILA — The public should ask officials leading the country's COVID-19 response why the government has to offer deploying more nurses to Britain to get coronavirus vaccines, a senator said on Thursday, as the Philippine immunization drive lagged.Malacañang on Wednesday backed the labor department's statement that the Philippines was open to lifting the cap on health workers' overseas deployment in exchange for vaccines from Britain and Germany, which it would use to inoculate outbound workers and hundreds of thousands of Filipino repatriates.While Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III and Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr, who initiated the offer, are ""very good people,"" Sen. Joel Villanueva said he disagreed with trading Filipino nurses for COVID-19 shots.""I don't think they are worth it na pag-usapan sa ganito. But more than anything, I think the bigger question here is bakit tayo humantong sa ganitong pagkakataon na tila baga parang you know, short of bartering our human resources for COVID vaccines,"" he said.
(I don't think they are worth so low that we should talk about them like this, but I think the bigger question here is why did come this, that it seems we are short of bartering our human resources for COVID vaccines.)
""Importanteng matanong natin iyan sa ating mga sarili, lalong-lalo na sa IATF (inter-agency task force on COVID-19) o doon sa mga nangangalaga nitong ating vaccination,"" the senator added in a televised public briefing.(It is important that we ask that to ourselves, especially to the IATF and those taking care of our vaccination.)The Philippines has not yet receive any vaccine shipment, with which it hopes to inoculate up to 70 million people or about two-thirds of its population this year.Video courtesy of PTV
A delay in the emergency use authorization of COVID-19 shots from China's Sinovac Biotech had pushed back their arrival initially set on Feb. 23.
The lack of an indemnity deal, which settles who should pay in case of adverse vaccine effects, delayed the arrival of 117,000 Pfizer doses through the vaccine-sharing COVAX Facility.
In the Senate's ""marathon hearings"" for the government's vaccination program, lawmakers never heard that an indemnification fund would be the ""end-all, be-all"" and ""deal breaker"" of the Pfizer jabs, said Villanueva.Congress, he said, has passed a bill creating a vaccine indemnification system. Duterte will sign the measure immediately after his office receives it, his spokesman Harry Roque said on Thursday.In backing the nurses-for-vaccines offer on Wednesday, Roque had said that while the Philippines has ordered enough vaccines for its adult population, ""Siyempre kung mas maraming supply pa ang makukuha natin, bakit hindi?""(Of course, if we can get more supplies, why not?)""Wini-welcome din natin [ito] because more is better than less,"" he told reporters.
(We welcome this because more is better than less.)
The Philippines earlier relaxed a ban on deploying its health care workers overseas, but still limits the number of medical professionals leaving the country to 5,000 a year.The proposal to provide more Filipino nurses to Europe in exchange for COVID-19 vaccines is ""insensitive and dehumanizing,"" said former vice president Jejomar Binay.""Our nurses are not commodities to be traded,"" Binay, also former presidential adviser on OFW affairs, said in a statement.Nurses are among the millions of Filipinos who work overseas, providing in excess of $30 billion a year in remittances vital to the country's economy. In 2019, almost 17,000 Filipino nurses signed overseas work contracts, government data showed.
Britain said there were 11,000 more nurses working in the National Health Service than last year. It said that while it was grateful to the 30,000 Filipinos working for the NHS, Britain did not need to trade vaccines for more.
""We have no plans for the UK to agree to a vaccine deal with the Philippines linked to further recruitment of nurses,"" a health ministry spokeswoman said, citing Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge to share spare shots later in the year.
""We have confirmed that we will share any surplus vaccines in the future - for example through the COVAX international procurement pool.""
Calls to Germany's mission in Manila went unanswered.
Britain and Germany have inoculated a combined 23 million people.While Filipino nurses have fought to lift the deployment ban to escape poor working conditions and low pay at home, the workers-for-vaccine plan has not gone down well with some medical workers.
""We are disgusted on how nurses and health care workers are being treated by the government as commodities or export products,"" said Jocelyn Andamo, secretary general of the Filipino Nurses United.Nurses on COVID vaccination of PSG: ‘Parang inapi yung health workers’

As our vaccine czar said, January of next year will not end without us sealing contracts for 150 million vaccine doses.)
Roque did not specify with which vaccine developers the country hopes to strike a deal. Earlier though, he had said that the government was eyeing to use 4 vaccines against the novel coronavirus by the first 3 months of 2021: from Russia's Gamaleya Institute, and China's Sinovac, Sinopharm and CanSino.
Roque said some critics have remarked that the Philippines is lagging behind other countries that have started their mass vaccination programs against COVID-19.
""Hindi po totoo iyan. Tulad ng aking sinabi, natural lamang na mauna ang mga mayayamang bansa dahil sila po ay nagbigay ng pondo para ma-develop ang mag vaccine na iyon,"" he said.(That is not true.

MANILA — COVID-19 vaccines from US-based Pfizer and Russia's Gamaleya Institute may arrive in the Philippines in February, Malacañang said on Thursday, as authorities raced to book supplies of the drug to begin inoculations as the coronavirus pandemic persisted over a year since it began in China.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said he was not at liberty to disclose how many jabs from Pfizer would arrive next month. The Food and Drug Administration just approved its application for emergency use approval, which shortens to 21 days the usual 6-month review before local use.

""Makakatanggap na rin daw tayo ng ilang bakuna galing sa Pfizer as early as February... Alam ko po, hindi gaanong karami ang matatanggap natin,"" he said, quoting vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez.
(We will also receive some vaccine doses from Pfizer as early as February. I know we won't get much.)
""Patunay po iyan na di tayo pumapabor kahit anong brand. Kung alin ang makakarating sa Pilipinas sa lalong madaling panahon, iyan po ang kukuhanin natin,"" Roque told reporters in an online briefing.

FDA head Rolando Enrique Domingo said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which has shown a 95-percent success rate, could be effective in preventing COVID-19. The disease has so far infected nearly half a million people.
""Hindi rin po imposible na by February, baka mayroon na rin tayong maangkat [na COVID-19 vaccine] galing po sa Gamaleya ng Russia,"" said Roque.
(It is also not impossible for us to import the COVID-19 vaccine from the Gamaleya Institute of Russia.)

Domingo said China's Sinovac Biotech on Wednesday submitted its emergency use authorization application.
That followed the release of late-stage trial data in Brazil that showed efficacy at just 50.4 percent. The Philippines has secured 25 million doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac, with the first 50,000 to arrive in February.
President Rodrigo Duterte defended the government's purchase of CoronaVac, saying on Wednesday night that it was as good as the shots developed by Americans and Europeans.
The Philippines has trailed regional peers in securing vaccines, with which it hopes this year to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of its population.
Galvez, who handles the vaccine procurement for the government, said it has now firmed-up supply deals with Novavax , Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Russia's Gamaleya Institute.
AstraZeneca and Gamaleya have pending emergency use applications with the FDA.

There is a total of 525,618 cases in the country as of Sunday, with 10,749 deaths and 487,551 recoveries.

Dado Ruvic, Reuters/FileMANILA— The Philippines this week will get its second delivery of COVID-19 shots through the vaccine-sharing COVAX Facility, Malacañang said on Wednesday.The country will receive 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 4, ""as part of the first round of allocated doses from the COVAX facility,"" said Palace spokesman Harry Roque.""AstraZeneca’s expected time of arrival is based on the scheduled handover of vaccines. We will notify everyone, if and when there is a change of schedule,"" he said in a statement.
The President will welcome the arrival of the vaccines in person, Roque earlier said.
But vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said he ""cannot confirm yet"" the arrival of the AstraZeneca doses.""Dalawang beses na kami nakuryente diyan. Mabuti i-confirm 'pag may plane nang lumipad from Belgium,"" reasoned Galvez, a former military general who is also chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.
(We have gotten wrong information about that twice.)The reason for contradicting information between the two Palace officials remains unclear.Government's earlier announcement of the supposed arrival of AstraZeneca shots on Monday did not push through over logistics issues.
The lack of an indemnity deal, meanwhile, has delayed the arrival of 117,000 Pfizer COVID-19 shots, which the COVAX Facility was initially expected to send in mid-February.
The Philippines on Sunday received its first vaccine supply, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 COVID-19 jabs from Beijing-based drug maker Sinovac Biotech.The World Health Organization's Representative in the Philippines, Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, had confirmed that around 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine, which the Philippine drug regulator already approved for emergency use, have been earmarked for the country under the COVAX Facility.
Some 17 million doses of the product, which the WHO listed for emergency use, have been procured as well by firms and local governments, according to presidential adviser for entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion.
AstraZeneca said it believed its vaccine could protect against severe disease, given that the neutralizing antibody activity was equivalent to that of other COVID-19 vaccines that have demonstrated protection against severe disease.
It noted though early last month that based on early data from a trial, its product appeared to offer only limited protection against mild disease caused by the South African variant of COVID-19.

MANILA — The Philippines is looking to borrow $325 million or around P15.6 billion for the procurement of vaccines against the novel coronavirus from the Asian Development Bank, its representative said on Monday.
Based on its population, the Philippines ""can access between $400 and $500 million lending for vaccine procurement,"" from the ADB, said its country representative Kelly Bird.
""At the moment, the government has requested approximately $325 million from the first component of the facility—that’s the rapid response component. And hat’s dedicated to financing the procurement of the vaccines,"" he said in a press briefing.
""ADB is working very closely and intensely with the government, even over the Christmas and New Year period to carry out the technical background work in preparing the vaccine project,"" Bird added.
To get the loan, one requirement is for the Philippines to produce a plan ""that will show which citizens will get the vaccine and when,"" he said.
The vaccines that will be procured with the ADB loan should have been selected by the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility (COVAX), prequalified by the World Health Organization, or authorized by a stringent regulatory authority.
For example, Pfizer's vaccine recently got authorization from the UK and the US, which satisfies the third criterion, said Bird.
The Philippines, which is wrestling with Southeast Asia's second-highest coronavirus caseload, has so far secured 2.6 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine of British drugs group AstraZeneca. Local firms bankrolled the procurement.

Last week, the ADB approved a ""pipeline"" for $9.4 billion in lending to the Philippines from 2021 to 2023, said Bird.
""Any financing for vaccine would be over and above that amount,"" he said.

Now we are fighting for the 18 percent because COVAX has gotten the other two percent.”The COVAX initiative is a vaccination program of the World Health Organization meant to provide poorer nations access to COVID-19 vaccines. The Philippines is one of 92 low- and middle-income countries which will be supported by the COVAX Advance Market Commitment, based on a WHO release in August.Galvez is essentially saying the developed world has hogged all COVID-19 vaccines, leaving little left for the rest of the world to haggle over.If Galvez is correct, that two percent of the market cornered by COVAX, which again styles itself as a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, seems almost comically disproportionate.PH may get 60 million more COVID-19 vaccine shots in 2021: Galvez
Negotiations with Pfizer, 6 other pharma firms on COVID-19 vaccines ongoing: Galvez
A total of 172 economies are engaged to participate in COVAX, 92 of which are low- and middle-income countries. Is two percent of all available COVID-19 vaccines enough for that?
Who is buying up all the vaccines? When can we expect Filipinos to be vaccinated? What costs are we looking at?
Let’s dig into the numbers.First let’s look at the total available number of vaccines.
ABS-CBN Data Analytics, data from Duke Global Health Innovation Center
As of December 18, data from the Duke Global Health Innovation Center showed over 7.7 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been purchased. If we assume these vaccines will require two doses per patient, as is the requirement for AstraZeneca and other vaccines, that is enough to cover half of the world’s population.But that is only true if the vaccines are distributed equitably. The World Health Organization initiative in charge of equitable distribution, COVAX, is the smallest buyer out of the four categories. High income nations have bought up the most, snapping up over 4 billion doses, more than half of the total confirmed number of doses purchased.Vaccinations against COVID-19 have just started in parts of the world, yet the inequality in vaccine availability is already undeniable.
ABS-CBN Data Analytics, data from Duke Global Health Innovation Center
Who are these nations buying up COVID-19 vaccines?The United States and the European Union have bought enough vaccines to cover nearly twice their entire populations. The United Kingdom can do the same three times. Canada, which is known for its progressive, multicultural, generous, and humanitarian ideals, has bought enough to cover its population five times.This might appear as a smart move since these vaccines are being bought without any guarantee they will work. Canada can safely say it has five shots at getting its COVID-19 vaccine right for its entire population, while the US and EU have two shots to do the same.However, this is also unfair considering COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of efficacy, are a scarce and precious resource. Buying up huge amounts of vaccine early is tantamount to robbing other nations of the opportunity to vaccinate against the virus.In fairness to Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said they would share excess doses if they have more than necessary. That means they want to make sure all Canadians are vaccinated before they start distributing extra doses elsewhere.The Economist Intelligence Unit
The Philippine government has said it is fighting to bring COVID-19 vaccines that work to the archipelago by 2021. Galvez said the going has been tough. A ""will they or won’t they"" deal with Pfizer has been published extensively.WATCH:
A private sector initiative, the Go Negosyo AstraZeneca deal, has also faced criticism after a decision to skip in-country clinical trials. Organizers, however, still expect to push through.This map by The Economist Intelligence Unit summarizes its assumptions on when vaccines are expected to be widely available for the general population of different countries. It shows that even the initial tranche of vaccines won’t be for everyone. It forecasts the wide distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will start by September 2021 at the earliest, and April 2022 to 2023 at the latest, depending on the nation.The Philippines is marked in red, putting it in the last category for wide vaccine distribution. The Economist has forecast the Philippines, alongside much of Southeast Asia, Africa, parts of South America, parts of Eastern Europe, parts of the Middle East, parts of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia, North Korea, and Mongolia would all be the last to enjoy wide distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.When it comes to COVID-19 vaccine availability, the Philippines, deemed one of the rising economic stars of Southeast Asia in 2019 thanks to its ascent towards an ""A"" credit rating and promising demographic dividend, has been lumped together with North Korea, which is facing steep economic sanctions from the international community, and Yemen, which is in the midst of a violent civil war.

Whatever the reason, there is one thing that is clear. The Philippines has been left off the COVID-19 vaccine priority list.
Suisse Research Institute
What do all the countries left off the vaccine priority list have in common? Money, or lack of it. This map from the Global Wealth Databook 2019, paints the world in terms of wealth.The darkest shades are the richest. The lightest shades are the poorest. Notice how the lighter shades on this map nearly matches the bright red on the vaccine availability map.Most of the nations who do not have early access to the COVID-19 vaccine have an average wealth per adult of below $25,000 or P1.2 million. The haves have it. The have nots don’t. Sec. Galvez was right.Hedging bets on vaccines that have not been proven effective is all well and good. Purchasing huge amounts of vaccine when current models show that production won’t be enough to cover the entire population of the world until as late as 2023 or 2024 is just terrible. It is exclusive at best, and borderline genocidal at worst.The rest of the world needs to be given a shot at getting vaccinated so they could finally get past this global pandemic. Rich nations shouldn’t be buying up vaccines knowing full well they are taking away vaccine access from their poorer counterparts.Whether or not the vaccines work is beside the point. The rich are simply telling the rest of the world to get in line after them, and that shouldn’t be the case this late in human history.If the Philippine government is having trouble procuring COVID-19 vaccines, Filipinos can expect more of the same, or worse. Filipinos with means won’t think twice about buying vaccines on their own.The largest corporations have already acted ahead of the Philippine government. Those without the means to get their own vaccines will no doubt be left out in the cold. It’s a safe bet these same Filipinos don’t have insurance coverage, or even jobs due to the pandemic-induced recession. The COVID-19 pandemic widened the class divide in the Philippines, and those on the wrong end of the spectrum will now be forced to face the virus for years without access to vaccines.As a final point, vaccinating an entire population should in theory protect that population from COVID-19. But it would depend on the efficacy of the vaccine and the absence of mutations that would render such vaccines ineffective. Would that population really feel safe if the rest of the world was full of unvaccinated individuals, walking petri dishes for fresh COVID mutations?Wouldn’t it be better if every single individual was vaccinated against the disease? Past diseases such as polio and smallpox were only successfully defeated through globally coordinated mass vaccinations. Conversely, such viruses have only made comebacks after certain parties actively campaigned against vaccination. COVID-19 is a global pandemic that has killed millions. It won’t likely be defeated without a global effort. Any nation, or individual left unvaccinated or unprotected leaves the world vulnerable to another outbreak or pandemic.
It is worth repeating.Everyone deserves a shot at COVID-19 immunity.Vaccines should not be reserved for the rich.Disclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",abscbn

“They submitted an application this morning and pre-evaluation is going on,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo told ABS-CBN News.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said during Thursday’s Laging Handa briefing that Bharat Biotech vaccine is one of those being considered for procurement by the Philippine government. But he said they have yet to see the results of its clinical trials.
The EUA application was also confirmed by IP Biotech and Ambica International, which have an exclusive agreement with Bharat Biotech to distribute the so-called COVAXIN vaccine in the Philippines.
According to the group, COVAXIN was developed by Bharat in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research - National Institute of Virology.“The indigenous, inactivated, whole virus vaccine has a standard cold chain temperature of 2-8 degrees Celsius, making it ideal for tropical countries,” IP Biotech said in its statement, adding that traditional inactivated vaccines are seen as a “safe and proven” based on long-term studies.
According to the group, the Philippines is on its list of priority countries for the COVAXIN supply and that the Indian government itself earlier issued a letter mentioning this.
IP Biotech said Bharat has over 140 current, fully registered and licensed globally-patented vaccines and biotherapeutics, a number of which are approved and available in the Philippines. Among the most prominent, according to the group, is the IndiRab rabies vaccine. Bharat biotech also has vaccines on rotavirus, typhoid and polio.
Based on the World Health Organization’s draft vaccine landscape document, COVAXIN comes in 2 doses.
An Associated Press report recently cited Bharat Biotech advising those with weak immunity, allergies and bleeding disorder to not take the vaccine. The report said Bharat Biotech was involved in controversy after the Indian government allowed its use without an efficacy rate.The company said it will release its efficacy data by March.
Previous reports said the company plans to produce 700 million doses of its COVID-19 vaccine this year.

The Philippines' FDA has so far granted EUA only to Pfizer's vaccine candidate against the coronavirus.
It continues to assess the EUA application of AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Institute, and Sinovac for their respective vaccine products.
The government hopes to inoculate up to 70 million of the country's population to achieve herd immunity against COVID-19. Vaccine supplies are expected to start arriving next month.
On Wednesday, the COVID-19 death toll in the Philippines breached the 10,000-mark, as the cumulative total of infections soared to 505,939. Active cases stood at 28,904.

MANILA - China has assured the Philippines that it would give Manila priority once it develops a vaccine for the novel coronavirus, a disease that had its origins in a Chinese city and has infected over 16 million worldwide and plunged various nations into recession.
Beijing gave its word after President Rodrigo Duterte told Filipinos in his State of the Nation Address that he asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to prioritize the Philippines once China develops a vaccine.
""The Philippines is a friendly close neighbor and we will give priority to its needs once we succeed in developing a vaccine,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing on Tuesday, a transcript of which was made available online.
Duterte says he asked China for credit, priority in COVID-19 vaccine
The rapidly spreading COVID-19 was first reported in China in December last year and has since become a global health and economic crisis.
Countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are partnering with pharmaceutical companies to secure COVID-19 vaccines upon successful development.

Wang said the disease outbreak has become a ""new highlight"" in Manila's diplomatic ties with Beijing even as the pandemic continues to threaten the health and livelihood of millions of Filipinos.
""Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China and the Philippines have been standing together with mutual assistance, turning anti-epidemic cooperation into a new highlight in bilateral relations,"" the Chinese official said.
Chinese firms are responsible for 2 of the 3 most advanced coronavirus vaccines that had entered Phase 3 trials, or large-scale testing on humans -- the last step before regulatory approval.
The third experimental vaccine on Phase 3 was developed by Oxford University in Britain and pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.
While leaders such as US President Donald Trump have criticized China over the pandemic, Duterte has been supportive of Beijing, even thanking the East Asian nation for its support to the Philippines during the crisis.
This even while Beijing has continued to shun Manila's assertions of a 2016 arbitral award of a United Nations-backed panel invalidating China's expansive claims to the South China Sea, encroaching into the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.
In his State of the Nation Address on Monday, Duterte said he was ""inutile"" in the face of China's military might as it ramped up island-building and fortification in the disputed waters.Duterte thanks Xi anew for support: 'Kung galing ng China, wala kayong problema'

MANILA — There won’t be any changes on the emergency use authorization (EUA) of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for now while Philippine authorities await a report from the company on the death of elderly people in Norway, the Department of Health said Monday.
This after Norway reported that some elderly people with underlying health conditions died after receiving the vaccine. Experts have noted that Norwegian authorities did not categorically say the vaccine caused the deaths.

“Studies have to be done so we can be able to validate at masasabi talaga kung 'yan ay may causality o epekto ng bakuna (and we can say if there is causality or it was an effect of the vaccine),” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a virtual briefing.
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of the Philippines also said studies need to be done, according to Vergeire.
“Pfizer have to submit to the Philippine Food and Drug Administration a report regarding this matter,” she said. “And once we evaluate this report and base sa kanilang (on their) conclusions, that’s the time when the Food and Drug Administration can decide on the EUA of Pfizer here in the country.”
The FDA granted EUA to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine last week, the first out of four applications it has received so far. The three other applicants are AstraZeneca, Gamaleya Institute of Russia and Sinovac from China.
Philippines approves Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use
“For now, habang wala pang malaking sufficient evidence to say that that is caused by the vaccine, tayo po ay status quo pa rin dito sa ating binigay na EUA ng Pfizer,” Vergeire said.
(For now, while we do not have sufficient evidence to say that those deaths were caused by the vaccine, we will still be on status quo for the EUA we issued to Pfizer.)
Vergeire said the deaths should be understood in the context that the vaccine was given to critically-ill elderly patients in a facility.
She also pointed out that “in a given time, they have reported 400 reported cases of deaths among these specific sector of the population.”
“Parang sinasabi nila, this might just be coincidental because the patients are severely ill and kahit yung minor reactions sa bakuna ay naka-apekto sa kanila. That’s why it led to their death,” she said.
(They seem to be saying it’s coincidental because the patients are severely ill and even the minor reactions to the vaccine may have an effect on them. That’s why it led to their death.)
“Still they are not closing the issue. They would like to look into it further,” she added.
The Philippines' vaccine expert panel is awaiting results of Norwegian authorities' investigation, said its head Nina Gloriani.
""Kung meron mang totoong naging adverse reaction, baka dahil ang mga pasyenteng ito ay sobrang matatanda, maraming comorbidities or sakit. At hindi natin pwede basta sabihin na dahil sa bakuna,"" Gloriani told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.
(If there really was an adverse reaction, it may be because these patients were too old, had several illnesses. We cannot say it was just because of the vaccine.)
""Pero dahil masyadong marami within, let us say, a few days or 1 week, kailangan lang pong imbestigahan.""
(But because there were too many deaths, within let us say a few days or 1 week, it needs to be investigated.)
Dr. Edsel Salvaña, member of the technical advisory group that advises the government's Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, also said, ""It's possible it may have contributed to their demise but they're (Norwegian authorities) not categorically stating that it is the vaccine that caused the death.""
""It may have contributed because common side effects like fever, chills from the vaccination, which are pretty much harmless in young people, may actually stress out these elderly people who have a lot of other comorbid condition,"" Salvaña, also the director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of the Philippines - National Institutes of Health, told ANC.
Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are allowed only for emergency use because they are still under development.
The FDA has noted that only a few people out of the more than 5 million people injected with Pfizer’s vaccine in other countries showed severe allergic reactions, and there were no other safety concerns.
The DOH and the Philippine government has emphasized the need for continuous monitoring of people who will receive the vaccines.
The country, which has already recorded more than half a million coronavirus infections, expects to receive COVID-19 vaccines as early as next month.
As of Sunday, the country has 24,691 active COVID-19 cases.

MANILA — An official leading the country's COVID-19 vaccination strategy apologized on Friday for the delay in the arrival of vaccines, as the Philippines lagged behind some of its regional neighbors that have already launched their respective inoculation drives.While mayors in Metro Manila have presented their own inoculation plans, the Philippines has not yet received any vaccine shipment.
“Kaunting pasensya lang po. Pasensya na po talaga na talagang hindi po natin kasi hawak iyong ating supply chain… doon sa mga vaccine,” said Carlito Galvez Jr, chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.(Have a little more patience.

“Sana po maintindihan n’yo po ang kalagayan ng gobyerno.

'Naiinip na': Duterte getting impatient over COVID-19 vaccine delay - Palace
Galvez, a former general, earlier said the absence of an indemnification program has delayed delivery of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech shots allocated to the Philippines through the vaccine sharing platform COVAX Facility.
The government had planned to use those, which were due to arrive in mid-February, to kick off its vaccination campaign.
PH still has to sign separate indemnity deal with Pfizer for its COVID-19 vaccine, says WHO
Malacañang this week said a separate shipment of 600,000 doses from China's Sinovac Biotech might be delayed due to its lack of an emergency use authorization in the Philippines.
“Minsan, ako po'y nahihiya dahil sabi nga, bakuna na lang ang kulang. Nasaan na iyong bakuna? Iyon ang question po sa atin ngayon,” said Galvez.(Sometimes, I am ashamed because as some say, everything is ready, we just lack the vaccines. Where are the vaccines? That's the question to us.)
“Bilang the leading person to really procure and manage and get the best vaccine for all of us, nakita natin na talagang medyo nahuli tayo nang kaunti.”(As the leading person to really procure and manage and get the best vaccine for all of us, we saw that we have lagged a bit.)

Galvez said 10 countries account for about 75 percent of 190 million global vaccinations, which he attributed to ""geopolitics.""He also notes that even Australia, which had excess vaccine orders, had yet to start its inoculation drive, while Japan has just started.
The Philippines' negotiation with the COVAX Facility is ""ongoing,"" he said.“We are hopeful na iyong COVAX, they will fulfill their commitment to bring us the 44 million doses,” said Galvez.“Dapat intindihin din natin sila, na iyong pagbabakuna ng buong mundo, isang malaking hamon din sa kanila,”
(We should also understand them because the global vaccination is a big challenge to them.)
Philippine officials will visit the Serum Institute of India that will produce 2 to 3 billion vaccine doses, including 30 million Novavax shots for the Philippines, he said.“Sa awa po ng Diyos, siguro po tingnan po natin, baka po meron ding umabot na vaccine this coming February and majority of our vaccine, baka magdating po ng March,” Galvez said.(God willing, let's see, perhaps a vaccine will arrive this February, and majority of our vaccines might arrive in March.)
“Iyon ina-advise ko po sa ating mga kababayan, na sana kaunting pasensya pa,” he added.
(This is my advice to our compatriots, I hope they could have a little more patience.)
Further delays in the vaccination drive could derail economic recovery after the country's worst contraction on record last year, when it slumped 9.5 percent, the biggest decline in Southeast Asia.

MANILA — The Philippines risks losing COVID-19 vaccines from various brands if authorities disclose their prices to the public, an official leading the inoculation drive said, after lawmakers sought to know how much the country would pay for each jab.
Authorities signed a confidentiality agreement that covers the prices of COVID-19 vaccines with all pharmaceutical groups that the government is negotiating with, said vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.
""Maaari pong mawala sa atin ang 148 million doses ng nine-negotiate po natin sa vaccine companies kapag lumabag po tayo sa ating kasunduan,"" he told reporters in an online briefing.

(There is no corruption.)
""Hindi po tayo papasok, ang pamahalaan, sa kahit anong negosasyon o pipirma sa isang kontrata kung tayo ay madedehado,"" he added.
(We, the government, will not enter any negotiation or sign a contract if we will be at a disadvantage.)
The government aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of the population, this year.
The Philippines has firmed up supply deals with China's Sinovac, US-based Pfizer, Novavax, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Russia's Gamaleya Institute, Galvez earlier said.
The Senate has launched an inquiry into vaccine transactions over questions about pricing transparency and efficacy.
""I'm telling now General Galvez to proceed with his game plan, with or without the investigation,"" President Rodrigo Duterte said in a televised speech on Monday.

MANILA (UPDATED)- President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday said the Philippines will borrow around $300 million to purchase a coronavirus vaccine.
Duterte issued the statement after Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE announced that their experimental vaccine is more than 90 percent effective against the deadly disease.
""Nandito na ang bakuna. It's being solved. Not good to assume there's a black market for that. But (Finance Sec.) Sonny (Dominguez) says he can borrow money... 300 million dollars. Malaki 'yan. So makapabili tayo. But I think it would do us well to realize that unahin talaga nila mga tao nila,"" Duterte said in a public briefing.
(The vaccine's here. It's being solved. Not good to assume there's a black market for that. But Sonny says he can borrow money... 300 million dollars. That's a huge amount. So we can buy. But I think it would do us well to realize that they will prioritize their people first.)
Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE are the first to release successful data from a large-scale clinical trial of a coronavirus vaccine. The firms said they have found no serious safety concerns so far and expect to seek US authorization this November for emergency use of the vaccine.

""Hindi na talaga nakakatakot ang COVID. But sa ngayon, magbili ka mahal. But as I have promised, gastos ng gobyerno itong bakuna para sa lahat ng Pilipino. Kaya umpisahan natin sa mga mahirap,"" Duterte said.
(COVID is not that scary anymore. But for now, it's expensive if you buy a vaccine. But as I have promised, the government will cover the vaccine costs for all Filipinos. The poor will be inoculated first.)
Duterte in July said the Philippine military will be the ""implementing arm"" of the country's coronavirus immunization program.
The Philippines earlier Tuesday registered 1,347 additional COVID-19 cases, bringing the country's total number of infections to 399,749. The country has 30,169 active infections, accounting for 7.5 percent of the total cases.The novel coronavirus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has claimed 7,661 lives in the Philippines, according to the health department. The total number of recovered patients stands at 361,919, which accounts for 90.5 percent of the total recorded cases.

Carlito Galvez regarding the details of the vaccine donation and its timetable. 
“China has said it will take into consideration our side’s needs,” she added.Locsin, meanwhile, expressed his gratitude to Wang for China’s assistance to the Philippines’ public health response since the outbreak through in-kind and equipment donations.‘Shelving differences’
Both Locsin and Wang affirmed the two countries’ “commitment to mutual respect, managing issues peacefully and in accordance with international law, and exploring areas for possible cooperation.”
China lays claim to almost the entire West Philippine Sea, a strategic waterway through which more than one-third of global trade passes. Its fortification of artificial islands with military assets including airstrips and anti-ship missiles has drawn fierce criticism from other claimants including the Philippines and Vietnam.
But the 2016 ruling by the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration invalidated Beijing’s 9-dash line claim, its basis for laying ownership to more than 80 percent of the South China Sea.
However, according to the statement, the two officials said that the maritime issues “do not represent the entirety” of the bilateral relationship.The Chinese foreign minister also emphasized the importance of shelving differences, citing how China and the Philippines have “withstood the test of the pandemic.”
“(W)e have stood shoulder to shoulder on the way forward to rise up to the challenges. I think it’s fair to say that the China-Philippines relations have withstood the test of the pandemic and learning this process our friendship has been further deepened,” Wang said, in a translated transcript of his remarks provided by the DFA.

“So standing at this new starting point of 2021, facing challenges beyond COVID-19 it is important for us to make an early plan of our interactions and cooperation for the whole year, shelve differences and build common ground, work closely with each other to firmly move forward along the course, jointly charted by our two presidents, and create more fruitful outcomes for our comprehensive strategic and cooperative relationship, and make more benefits to our two countries and the people of our two countries,” he added.He also vowed Beijing’s cooperation in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, saying he is ready to share “China’s stocks and announcements of China’s decision regarding vaccine cooperation.”

MANILA - With the potential coronavirus vaccines on the horizon, vaccine mistrust could undermine the Philippines' effort in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, a public health expert said Tuesday.
Speaking to ANC's ""Matters of Fact,"" Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, said conducting a massive information campaign would be critical in building vaccine confidence in the country.
""We know for a fact [that] the Philippines, after the Dengvaxia controversy in 2018, has become the biggest vaccine hesitant country in this part of the world,"" she said.
""This is really impacting on all the vaccine trials that we are doing on this COVID-19 pandemic and the introduction of the vaccine that will be safe and effective for our people.""
In late 2017, the government stopped its nationwide dengue vaccination program and pulled Dengvaxia off the market after drug maker Sanofi warned that the vaccine might cause severe symptoms if given to those who did not have prior exposure to the mosquito-borne disease.
In February, state prosecutors formally accused former Health Secretary and now Iloilo Rep. Janette Garin and several others of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide over the deaths of 8 children who received Dengvaxia.
The controversy has been blamed for the decline in immunization coverage in the Philippines.
State prosecutors indict ex-DOH chief Garin over Dengvaxia-linked deaths
As online misinformation may affect vaccine uptake, Bravo urged the public to listen to the experts.
""If a vaccine is made available to public, the safety and efficacy of this vaccine has been proven. This is what people should really understand that no one, no government... will want anything that will go into harm to our country,"" she said.
The Philippines, Bravo stressed, has ""one of the biggest pool of very good vaccine experts and vaccine panelist in the world.""
US drug maker Pfizer recently reported its vaccine was 95 percent effective at preventing COVID-19 while AstraZeneca's vaccine developed with the University of Oxford showed an average 70-percent efficacy.
American pharmaceutical firm Moderna also announced its experimental vaccine was around 95 percent effective against preventing the novel coronavirus.

MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte said national recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic is ""within sight"" as the Philippines secures vaccine jabs against the respiratory disease that has led to nearly a year-long lockdown and economic recession.
Duterte said this in a taped message as local government units and private firms helped lock in 17 million doses so far of the COVID-19 vaccine from British drugs group AstraZeneca.
""There is light at the end of the tunnel. National recovery is within sight. As we bounce back and heal as one, I commend the business community and the LGUs for your ramping of support for our nation’s fight against COVID-19,"" the President said.
Duterte pledged his ""full support"" for the initiative that he called ""bayanihan at work.""
""We now have the weapon to defeat this virus – the vaccine. And let us win the war and save lives and livelihood,"" he said.
The Philippines has also secured 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech, and 30 million doses from the Serum Institute of India.
The country might also receive an initial vaccine batch from SU-based Pfizer and Russia's Gamaleya Institute in February, said Malacañang.

“Nagtanong sa atin ang Moderna, Bharat Institute at Serum institute of India at mukha namang interesado,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
(Moderna, Bharat Institute and Serum Institute of India already inquired and they seem to be interested.)
Domingo also told ABS-CBN’s Teleradyo that they already sent the requirements list for an EUA to the said companies. An EUA grant allows the use of vaccines in the country with faster local validation.
American company Moderna is among the world’s frontrunners in the race for COVID-19 vaccines. Like Pfizer, it uses new technology for its RNA-based vaccine. Also among the 10 frontrunners is American firm Novavax, which has partnered with the Serum Institute of India.
India’s Bharat Biotech, which uses the traditional inactivated vaccine, is also on Phase III trials like the other companies mentioned.
If they are granted an EUA, their vaccines can be imported into the Philippines and used for the national government’s immunization program.
Moderna is set to provide 20 million doses to the Philippines while 30 million doses are expected from Novavax.

Currently, only Pfizer has an EUA from the Philippines.United Kingdom-based AstraZeneca may be the next company to receive approval from the country, according to the FDA.
Domingo said Russia’s Gamaleya Institute has also submitted the results of its Phase III trials, allowing them to start the review.
Sinovac, which is expected to donate and sell vaccines to the Philippine government, has yet to submit Phase III trial results. Domingo said release of the EUA will depend on Sinovac’s response to clarifications and its speed in response.
The government aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of its population, this year.
It hopes to secure supply deals for 148 million doses this January. The Philippines has firmed up supply deals with China's Sinovac, US-based Pfizer, Novavax, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Russia's Gamaleya Institute, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez earlier said.

MANILA - Belgium has guaranteed that COVID-19 vaccines will be available to all countries, including the Philippines.
In a note verbale transmitted to foreign embassies in the European country Thursday, Belgium said that companies “will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations towards third countries, and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will not be interrupted.”
Two pharmaceutical firms that produce COVID-19 vaccines— Pfizer and Janssen— are manufactured in Belgium.
The note verbale, a copy of which was shared by the Belgian Embassy in the Philippines, discussed the new procedure for requesting an export license to procure COVID-19 vaccines from outside the European Union (EU).
It highlighted that ""within the framework of this new procedure, these companies will be able to fulfil their contractual obligations towards third countries and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will not be interrupted.""
“The Belgian Government takes pride in the fact that Belgium is the home of the production facilities of some of the world’s most renowned pharmaceutical companies and will spare no effort to ensure that within the framework of this new procedure, these companies will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations towards third countries and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will not be interrupted,” the note verbale read.
The Embassy said Belgium “is very proud to be at the epicenter of the manufacturing of vaccines during this pandemic.”
“Belgium guarantees that the COVID-19 vaccines will be available for all countries, including the Philippines,” the Embassy said.
The Philippines earlier approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use as the country aims to immunize 100,000 to 200,000 Filipinos daily in a national vaccine rollout.
The country's first batch of 117,000 COVID-19 shots from the US-Belgian drugmaker will come from the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to vaccines. The Philippine vaccine czar said they will request an additional 900,000 Pfizer vaccines.

MANILA - Most Filipinos may have to wait until 2022 to get a shot of the coronavirus vaccine, an official leading the country's pandemic response said Monday, as the government will prioritize health-care workers and other vulnerable groups, with vaccine supply expected to be initially limited.
Speaking to ANC's Matters of Fact, vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez said equitable access to COVID-19 vaccine may be available only in 2022, despite encouraging results from some vaccine candidates that are nearing regulatory approval.
""Only maybe in 2022 we'll have maybe equitable access with the [vaccine],"" he said.
""Maybe, during 2022 when we have enough supply for the vaccine, we might allow the commercialization of the vaccine. But for 2021, even [the] World Health Organization (WHO) and also the vaccine makers, they will not indulge on commercial involvement of the private sector,"" he added.
Priority will be given to health-care workers, indigents, vulnerable groups, essential workers, policemen and soldiers, Galvez said.

Authorities will also employ a geographical strategy for the distribution of the vaccine, with those badly-hit by the pandemic such as Metro Manila, Cebu and Davao to be prioritized, he added.

The Philippine government is building a portfolio of COVID-19 vaccines from various drug makers, saying it is already negotiating with China's Sinovac, Johnson & Johnson's pharmaceutical arm Janssen and US drug maker Pfizer, among others, for possible vaccine supply deal.
""Our estimate is that we're getting 10, 15 or even 20 million [doses] from each of these vaccine makers, [then] we can get our quota for this year,"" he said.
P73.2 billion needed to vaccinate 60 million Filipinos vs COVID-19: Dominguez
The Department of Finance (DOF) had said the government would need at least P73.2 billion to procure vaccines against the novel coronavirus for 60 million Filipinos, in hopes of achieving herd immunity. But as most vaccines require 2 doses, the target population can be slashed by half.
The country's latest projected population, as of the third quarter this year, is 108.8 million, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.A bulk of the funding for the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccines will come from the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank through low-cost, long-term loans, the DOF said.
Some P20 billion will come from domestic sources like the Landbank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines, as well as other government-owned and controlled corporations and bilateral negotiations.
The Philippines on Friday signed a deal with AstraZeneca for the purchase of 2 million possible coronavirus vaccines as part of the private sector's initiative to boost the country's fight against the disease.
Private firms such as San Miguel, Aboitiz, Ayala, JG Summit Holdings and Megaworld will pay for the vaccines, of which half will be donated to the government. The other half will be used to inoculate the private sector's employees, said Galvez.
As of Sunday, the Philippines has tallied 429,864 coronavirus cases, of which 8,373 deaths were linked to the disease, 398, 624 are recoveries, while 22,867 are active infections.

MANILA — The head of Parañaque City's Health Office on Saturday became the first person in the Philippines to receive the first-ever dose of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine, a shipment of which arrived in the country earlier this week via the COVAX Facility.Dr. Olga Virtusio, who is 60 years old, is among those prioritized for the AstraZeneca vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration said is suitable for senior citizens. It was the second brand to reach the Philippines, next to Chinese firm Sinovac's CoronaVac.
Virtusio said she prepared for the vaccination by getting enough sleep and by eating healthy food. She said she felt no adverse side effects even after the observation period.“I think being the head of our city health office in Parañaque City… prompted me to lead my staff to show the people that this is a very safe vaccine. I don’t think dapat tayo matakot sa bakuna,” she said.“Nahihiya ako, di ko naman alam na ako 'yung una. I’m very proud and happy. Noon pa lang gusto ko na sa Sinovac pero they stopped me,” she added.(I don’t think we should be scared to be vaccinated, I am shy and I did not expect that I would be the first to be inoculated. I wanted to have Sinovac before but they stopped me.)

Unlike China’s Sinovac vaccine, which arrived last Sunday, AstraZeneca shots can be administered to the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions. However, it is not yet recommended for those below 18.
The Ospital ng Parañaque District II was the first hospital to receive AstraZeneca vaccines, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said. The hospital received an allotment of 200 doses meant for senior citizen health care workers.“After the AstraZeneca vaccines arrived, we are blessed to be chosen as the venue of the first vaccination of the AstraZeneca in the country. This will be very helpful especially to the senior citizens,” Dr. Jefferson Pagsisihan, the hospital director, said.

The remaining 10 percent, meanwhile, have their reservations.“We’re very happy and thankful na napili tayo na unang-una dito sa Metro Manila o sa buong bansa.

The official also emphasized that the President’s strict instruction was to prioritize the inoculation of some 1.7 million health care workers in the country whose vaccination is targeted to be finished by April.He added that the government would prioritize the vaccination in areas with high COVID-19 cases, including Metro Manila and Central Visayas.“Nakita natin na kung sino 'yung mga hindi nabigyan ng Sinovac at willing mabigyan ng bakuna, 'yun ang bibigyan natin. Ang priority is 'yung mga lugar na may pagtaas at nakita namin 'yung tumataas 'yung new cases 'yung NCR, Region 8, 7, Baguio and Davao City.” he said.(We identified the places that will not be given Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine and those areas willing to receive it.

MANILA - The Philippine Red Cross (PRC) on Tuesday said it is in talks with pharmaceutical giants Pfizer and AstraZeneca to procure COVID-19 vaccines that would be sold to Filipinos on a ""buy 1, donate 1"" scheme.
The Philippine Red Cross has written a letter to the 2 pharmaceutical giants to procure some 1 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, PRC chair Sen. Richard Gordon told reporters in an online press conference.
""The first plan of the Red Cross is to vaccinate... Ang labanan dito distribution [na] mabilis (This is a matter of the quick distribution of vaccines),"" he said.
The PRC is set to meet with Pfizer representatives after the press conference, he said.
""It's [in the] early days. Magdasal tayo na makuha natin (Let's pray that we get it),"" he said.
While the PRC has yet to finalize the procurement deal, the non-profit organization has already earmarked some $20 million (P961 million) for the program, he said.
Should the deal push through, PRC frontliners will be among priority recipients of the COVID-19 vaccines, while the rest will be sold to Filipinos who are willing to buy another dose that will be donated to the less fortunate, Gordon said.
The price depends on which vaccine will be procured, he said.
""I'm sure many Filipinos would like to do it... We should share our good fortune,"" he said.
While the PRC is still waiting to get its own COVID-19 vaccines, the agency is willing to help the government in its inoculation program, Gordon said.
Last year, Health officials said the Philippines is planning to buy 2 million COVID-19 vaccines from AstraZeneca, but the national government has yet to explain to the public its full plan for the procurement, distribution and storage of COVID-19 vaccines.

The US-produced COVID-19 drug is estimated to cost the government P366 for 2 doses, which means that the P82.5 billion vaccine fund under the 2021 budget could cover the inoculation of some 225.4 million people, more than double the Philippines' 106 million population.
But the the Novavax COVID vaccine remains on its third phase of trial, lagging behind China's Sinovac, UK's AstraZeneca, US's Pfizer, and Russia's Gamaleya, which are already in talks with the Philippine government.

ASTRAZENECA
British drugmaker AstraZeneca, which inked a deal with the Philippines for 2.6 million doses of the vaccine, costs about 2 times higher than Novavax's product, but showed an average 70 percent effectiveness.
That rate jumped to 90 percent when an initial half-dose then a full dose was given, similar to the effectiveness of rival vaccines producers Pfizer and Moderna.
Priced at P610 for 2 doses, the Philippines can have up to 135.24 million people inoculated should it spend its entire P82.5 billion COVID-19 vaccine fund for the purchase of AstraZeneca's product.
Philippines, private firms sign vaccine supply deal with AstraZeneca
Last week, more private firms expressed interest in joining the government's supply deal with the AstraZeneca, thanks to the British vaccine-maker's high effectiveness and low price point.
More firms want to join AstraZeneca supply deal: gov't adviser
GAMALEYA
The COVID-19 vaccine from Russia's Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology is estimated to cost P1,220 for 2 doses.
This means that only 67.62 million Filipinos, about half the number of beneficiaries under AstraZeneca's price, could be inoculated should the government use its 2021 COVID-19 vaccine fund for this product.
Gamaleya earlier asserted that its vaccine is 92 percent effective, but the company has yet to submit documents to prove its claim, according to Dr. Nina Gloriani, University of the Philippines College of Public Health professor and head of the Department of Science and Technology’s vaccine technical panel.
""They have provided us with animal studies Phases I and II data. But their Phase 3 study protocol . . . still has some missing information. So we have requested that. And the informed consent has not been submitted,"" Gloriani earlier said.
""We want the scientific data. We cannot rely on what is published in the internet,"" she said.

PFIZER
While Pfizer's P2,379-vaccine (for 2 doses) is more expensive compared to other brands, the US-produced drug is known to have one of the highest effectiveness rate at at least 90 percent.
Pfizer is also hailed as the first COVID-19 vaccine that earned an approval from a government after the United Kingdom jumped ahead to begin its most crucial mass inoculation program using the said brand.
UK approves Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, first in the world
The World Health Organization (WHO) has described Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine as ""very promising"", but some buyers have been turned off by the product's cold chain issues.
Unlike its rivals, Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine needs to be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (-94 F) or below to maintain its efficacy.
Sen. Aquilino ""Koko"" Pimentel said he hopes that the bulk of the COVID-19 vaccine fund would be used to procure the actual drug instead of additional equipment for storage.
""Sana hindi na tayo magtayo pa ng freezers, renting freezers just so vaccines can be brought to different parts of the archipelago,"" he said, without naming a particular brand.

Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine 'very promising' but has cold chain issues: WHO
Pfizer has been reportedly working on solving its COVID-19 vaccine's cold storage issues.
SINOVAC
China's Sinovac appears to be the second most expensive COVID-19 vaccine based initial estimates, as it is expected to be priced at P3,629.50 for 2 doses.
At this price point, the Philippine government can inoculate 22.73 million Filipinos, or about a quarter of the population, against COVID-19 next year.
Aside from its high price, the legitimacy of Sinovac products was recently questioned after the Washington Post reported that the company's chief executive officer admitted to bribery.
Citing court records, the Washington Post said that Sinovac's CEO had admitted to giving more than $83,000 (P3.99 million) to a regulatory official from 2002 to 2011 to expedite certifications for its SARS vaccine and a swine flu vaccines.
The Department of Health earlier said that Philippines' vaccine panels would look into reports.
Philippines to look into bribery claim vs Sinovac
MODERNA
Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine is estimated to be the most expensive option with a price tag ranging between P3,904 and P4,504 for 2 doses, depending on how many vials are ordered.
A recent study showed that the vaccine from the Massachusetts-based company could trigger the human immune system to produce COVID-19 antibodies that lasts for at least 3 months.
The Moderna vaccine also boasts of having a 94 percent effectiveness rate.
Moderna vaccine confers at least 3 months immunity: study
Last month, the European Union secured 160 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine taking the EU's potential stock of COVID-19 shots to nearly 2 billion.
EU secures 160 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine
OTHER COSTS
Angara noted that the estimates have yet to cover the cost of other items needed for the administration of COVID-19 vaccines.
The government needs to spend P1,200 for the training of one vaccinator for every 350 people, and another P1,924 for personal protective equipment, needles and syringes used during the inoculation process, according to the data presented in the Senate.
The Senate earlier agreed to hike the COVID-19 vaccine fund to P83 billion next year, but the fund was reduced at P72.5 billion after the bicameral conference committee realigned portions of the sum to other programs under the 2021 budget.

PHILIPPINES' COVID-19 VACCINE PLAN?

""It's a rough estimate. It's a moving target,"" he said.

MANILA — A hold-up in the processing of some documents has pushed back the arrival of US-based Pfizer'scoronavirus shots in the Philippines, an official leading the country's pandemic response said on Thursday.

MANILA - Only 3 out of 10 individuals in Metro Manila are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) bared Sunday.
According to DILG Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III, a survey conducted by the department showed 20 to 30 percent of the capital region's residents affirmed their consent to be inoculated against the deadly disease.
This is much lower than the DILG's target of immunizing at least 80 percent of Metro Manila residents.

Densing however said government won't force the public to get their jabs, but it will double its efforts to encourage them.
“Patuloy kaming umiikot, no? Umiikot kami sa Metro Manila, Calabarzon. Sa susunod na linggo, babiyahe rin po kami Mindanao, sa Davao City para ipaliwanag ho sa taong bayan ang importansya ng pagbabakuna,” aniya.

An online survey conducted by University of Santo Tomas professors and students had also showed only 55.9 percent of their 15,651 respondents are willing to be vaccinated.
The open access online survey, conducted by the UST-CoVAX research team from January 16 to 30, 2021 and posted on several social media platforms in both Filipino and English forms, was answered by Filipinos from all 17 regions in the country.

Measles outbreak declared in NCR, Central Luzon
Secretary to the Cabinet Karlo Nograles said the immunization program is on the agenda of Wednesday’s Cabinet meeting.
The Department of Health has raised alarm over the rising number of measles cases in the country, with some officials blaming the fiasco involving dengue vaccine Dengvaxia for the reluctance of some parents to subject their newborns to measles vaccination.
Duterte has urged Filipinos to avail of vaccines with proven efficacy, especially for newborns.

Cases of measles, locally known as ""tigdas,"" rose by 550 percent from January 1 to February 6, 2019 in Metro Manila compared to the same period last year, said Health Secretary Francisco Duque.
The DOH recorded 169 cases of measles in the capital region from January 1 to February 6 this year, higher than the 26 cases recorded in the same period last year.
Since January, at least 55 deaths from measles was recorded at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, most of them children aged 3 months to 4 years old.
At least 248 children were being treated for the disease at the San Lazaro Hospital as of Tuesday morning.
In Central Luzon, Jesse Fantone, chief of the DOH's Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, confirmed the outbreak.
As of February 2, the DOH in Central Luzon has recorded 442 suspected cases of measles.

MANILA — Three major urban hubs in the Philippines will serve as sites for COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials as the government rushes to find an end to the pandemic that has upended life worldwide.
Metro Manila, the Southern Tagalog region (Calabarzon), and Cebu will serve as vaccine trial zones, Science Secretary Fortunato dela Peña said Thursday.
""Ang pinipili kasing lugar ay iyong mataas ang incidence ng COVID-19,"" he said in a virtual press briefing.
(We choose places with high incidence of COVID-19).
""Usually it will require anywhere between five to 10 barangays (villages) for a trial,"" he added.
The three areas have reported high numbers of COVID-19 infections, with Metro Manila as the coronavirus epicenter of the country.
The government's pandemic task force earlier approved guidelines for the conduct of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials which would require volunteers from villages with the highest number of coronavirus infections.
How will the Philippines run COVID-19 vaccine trials?
""Importante kasi na iyong lugar na pipiliin ay malapit doon sa mga lugar na mataas ang incidence o ang cases dahil ating susubukan ang efficacy nang bakuna,"" Dela Peña said.
(It's important that we choose an area near those that have high incidence of COVID-19 because we will test the efficacy of the vaccine.)
""Hindi puwedeng magdoble ang clinical trials sa isang zone,"" he noted.
(We cannot have duplicates of clinical trials in one zone.)
In assigning COVID-19 vaccine trial zones, Dela Peña said priority would be given to testing of drugs included in the World Health Organization's Solidarity Trials, a global coalition on the simultaneous development of vaccines.
Malacañang has expressed hopes that Manila would be prioritized by Russia, China, and the US should they develop a COVID-19 vaccine.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/01/17/20/what-the-public-needs-to-know-as-polio-resurfaces-in-the-philippines,What the public needs to know,"Niña Corpuz, ABS-CBN News",Jan 17 2020 12:48 AM,"When the Department of Health (DOH) confirmed last September that polio is back in the country after 19 years, members of the Filipino medical community shook their heads. How could we let this happen?Some were quick to point out that it was the result of vaccine hesitancy after the Dengvaxia controversy in 2017. But it wasn’t as simple as that.A November 2019 polio outbreak situation report from the UNICEF-WHO Philippines attributed the outbreak to persistently low routine immunization coverage, as well as poor sanitation and hygiene.Polio is spread through fecal-oral transmission in contaminated food or water, or through direct contact with a person infected with polio.“It was like a time bomb, waiting to explode,” said Dr. Gigi Bibera, pediatrician and member of the Pediatric Infectious Society of the Philippines (PIDSP).
Bibera said it took many years for the virus to mutate and cause an outbreak and, due to the country’s low immunization coverage, what happened in the Philippines was “an expected phenomenon”.“The immunization coverage was already low, and after the Dengvaxia scare, it became even lower,” she added.The DOH recently announced the first case of polio in Metro Manila, a 3-year-old boy from Quezon City, bringing the total number of confirmed polio cases in the country to 16 since September. Most of those who fell ill are from areas in Mindanao with very poor sanitation; they are all children who never received the polio vaccine.Bibera explained that the virus seen in these cases was not the “wild virus”.
“The virus is in the environment, it’s attenuated (a weakened form of the virus), hindi naman s’ya ’yung wild virus. But when one child gets it, slowly it will revert back, mutate back and will replicate in the child’s gut which will then be excreted, and another child can get it and again this will mutate,” she said.
“That’s why it’s called ‘circulating vaccine derived polio virus’ or CVDPV because it’s circulating from one child to another until such time that the virus has already mutated into the live, not the attenuated form but the pathogenic (or disease causing) form already.
“If the child is not immunized, the child will get the circulating vaccine derived polio virus.”
This process took years, continued Bibera. “ ’Yung nagsi-circulate na ’yun, matagal ’yun, years, because we have been polio-free for many years.”
Unfortunately, immunization coverage became low and everyone became susceptible, “so that circulating virus became a disease that is now the CVDPV”.
Why do vulnerable children still need the oral polio vaccine?
There are two types of polio vaccine: the inactivated polio virus vaccine (IPV) given as an injection and the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Most Filipino private pediatricians just have the IPV, and it is assumed that their patients have already received it.
But the DOH is encouraging parents and caregivers of children under 5 years old to get the OPV, even if they have already gotten the IPV. The DOH recently launched a national immunization campaign called “Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio,” which gives the oral vaccine for free at public and private hospitals.“An oral polio vaccine is needed to actually stop the transmission, while the injectable or inactivated polio vaccine gives you individual protection,” Bibera said.
“For example, while your kids are already complete with IPV but we now know there is a circulating oral polio virus in the environment, they can be exposed and may ingest the virus.
“When kids ingest the polio virus itself and they do not have the gut immunity that the oral polio virus gives, the polio virus can replicate in their stomach, in their gut.
“What will happen? They won’t get the disease because they are protected by the injection but they can excrete the virus and be the source, so the virus can now be transmitted to other children. You can be the source of the virus but not get the disease.”
There is no cure for polio
Dr. Maria Paz Corrales, assistant regional director of the DOH-NCR, said there is no treatment for polio and that immunization is the only way to prevent transmission.
“Polio disease has re-emerged in the Philippines after being declared polio-free in 2000. There were 142 environmental samples taken for testing for the presence of the polio virus. From these samples, 26 tested positive and of these, 25 are from NCR and 1 from Mindanao,” Corrales said.
“It is now because of this that we needed to conduct synchronized polio vaccination to achieve 95 percent community immunity.”
Corrales reported that the synchronized immunization was done August 19 to 31, 2019 (round 0), then round 1 from October 14 to 27 for the whole of NCR. Round 2 was done last December 25 to December 7 for the whole of NCR. For Mindanao, round 0 was on October 14-27 for Lanao del Sur, Davao City and Davao del Sur. Round 1 was done November 25 to December 7 for all Mindanao areas.
What is better, IPV or OPV?
“It’s not a question which is better. Ideally, you have to get both, because one, you want to protect yourself, and two, you want to protect the community at large,” Bibera said.
“We cannot eradicate polio if you don’t stop the transmission. It is your social responsibility to stop the transmission.”More rounds of free polio vaccination will be done for all Mindanao areas and NCR from January to March 2020.
Corrales reiterated that the free polio vaccination is intended for children 5 years old and below, regardless of vaccination status. ",abscbn

MANILA - Designated COVID-19 hospitals in Metro Manila will be the first to receive COVID-19 vaccines that are set to arrive in the country next week, a Department of Health official (DOH) said Monday.
The Metro Manila Center for Health Development chief Dr. Corazon Flores these hospitals include Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Tala, Caloocan; Philippine General Hospital in Manila; and the Lung Center of the Philippines in Quezon City. The National Kidney Transplant Institute's inclusion has yet to be finalized.
Flores said their top priority will be 4,557 employees and health workers from PGH, 1,900 in Tala hospital, and 1,117 from the Lung Center. She mentioned no specific figures yet for the rest of the hospitals.
“Ongoing po yung uploading ng data sa COVID electronic information registry,” she told ABS-CBN News.
Metro Manila has about 104,000 health workers in both government and private hospitals, to include clinics and other health facilities, according to DOH-MMCHD’s data.
“Siyempre, pagdating ng vaccine, dadaan pa sa RITM (Research Institute for Tropical Medicine), FDA (Food and Drug Administration), ita-transport pa 'yan sa hospital kaya hindi po natin mai-specific ang date (pag bakuna), but tentatively we have to prepare by next week,” she said.
For the Tala Hospital, Flores said that its nurses, doctors and other employees, like the security and maintenance staff, whether contractual or permanent employees, are all listed as priority for the vaccine.
While the taking the COVID shot is voluntary, Flores said the DOH will continue to enlighten health workers of the importance and benefit of the vaccine through town hall meetings in hospitals.
“Yung iba kasi na tumatanggi eh, namimili ng vaccine. 'Yan naman po naririnig natin, kaya po we are continuously giving the education campaign, information drive, even sa hospital para ma-clarify,” she said.
“Kailangan makinig tayo sa information, we ensure that the vaccine will be given are of quality and pumasa sa FDA natin,"" she added.
The hospitals have also already conducted their simulation of the vaccination process, Flores said. She suggested having a proper schedule and contingency plan as most hospital workers are expected to get back to work right after taking the vaccine.
“Let's say we have 10 health workers, there pwedeng tatlo muna ngayon, tomorrow 'yung another 3, then next day another 3 para hindi lang mawalan ng naka duty doon sa ward,” she said.
In recent weeks the government’s Coordinated Operations to Defeat Epidemic (CODE) team has made rounds in different cities in Metro Manila to evaluate masterlists, microplans and the mapping of vaccination sites and preparedness of vaccination teams and cold storage facilities.
“Sa atin pong publiko, ito na po hinihintay natin para tayo maproteksyunan, tayo magpabakuna para sa COVID-19,"" Flores urged.
Vaccine Czar Sec. Carlito Galvez earlier said the government targets 50-70 million Filipinos will be inoculated by the end of 2021.

The DOH said two rounds of the ""Sabayang Patak Kontra Polio"" campaign will be held in NCR from January 27 to February 7, and March 9 to March 20.
A limited response round, meanwhile, will be conducted in Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Zamboanga City, Isabela City, and Lambayong, Sultan Kudarat on January 6 to 12.
The rest of Mindanao will also have two rounds, scheduled on February 17 to March 1 and March 23 to April 4.
The DOH said it aims to achieve 95-percent coverage in each round to ensure that no child is left unvaccinated.
""We need the participation of everybody to successfully end this outbreak – other government agencies, the local government units, partners, our local health workers and bakunators,"" said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III in a statement.
Prior to the extension, the supposed last round of vaccination was scheduled this month in Mindanao.
In September, the DOH confirmed the return of polio in the Philippines 19 years after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the country free from the disease.
At least 9 cases of polio have been recorded in the country since September.
Polio is a ""highly infectious viral disease, which mainly affects young children,"" according to the WHO. Severe polio cases may cause paralysis and death.
Children are recommended to receive 3 OPV doses and one shot of inactivated polio vaccine to be fully protected from the disease.",abscbn

Areas badly hit by COVID-19 to be prioritized in vaccine rollout
MANILA - The Philippine government is negotiating with four pharmaceutical companies developing a vaccine for COVID-19.
Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr., the country's ""vaccine czar"", said the government's vaccine experts are currently analyzing 17 different COVID-19 vaccines.Of this number, 5 vaccines will be tested on Filipinos, including vaccines developed by China's Sinovac, Russia's Gamaleya, UK's AstraZeneca, and American company Johnson & Johnson.
Galvez also said that after President Rodrigo Duterte allowed the emergency use of coronavirus vaccines and approved an advance payment to their private developers, the government is now negotiating with four vaccine makers - Sinovac, Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson.
""When you approved the procedures and the strategies na magkaroon po tayo ng tinatawag na advanced market commitment. Sa ngayon po, puwede na po tayo, nagne-negotiate na po tayo sa 4 na malalaking kumpanya, kasama na po ang Sinovac from China, ang ating AstraZeneca at Pfizer,"" Galvez, who is also the country's chief implementer of the National Action Plan against COVID-19, said during the Cabinet's weekly briefing with the president.
(When you approved the procedures and the strategies, we can now have advanced market commitment. We can now negotiate, and we are negotiating with 4 big companies, including Sinovac, AstraZeneca and Pfizer.)
Galvez said the government hopes to sign a memorandum of understanding with AstraZeneca before the end of the month.
The British company will be reserving 20 million doses for the Philippines. According to Galvez, AstraZeneca is among those companies with the most affordable vaccine at around $5 per dose.
Once an MOU is signed, the vaccine from AstraZeneca, may be available around the second quarter of 2021.
Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also eyeing 20 million doses each from Sinovac and Pfizer, for a total of around 60 million doses which will be administered to the country's most vulnerable sectors, as well as frontline health care workers, the police and the military.
VACCINE ROLLOUT GEOGRAPHICALLY, BY SECTOR
Galvez said once available, the government will roll out the vaccines geographically and then by sector.
""Meaning 'yung deployment po ng vaccine, para doon sa infected at yung mga tinatawag nating epicenter,"" he said.
(This means the deployment will be for those who are infected and in what we consider as epicenters.)
Among the areas to be given priority are the National Capital Region, Cebu City, Davao City and Bacolod, as well as other areas which logged a high number of COVID-19 cases.
""Priority ang NCR, priority ang Davao dahil ang Davao po ngayon umaakyat din, priority ang Cebu, priority po 'yung Bacolod, yung mga tinamaan po nang mabigat ng COVID, para at least malalaman po kaagad 'yung efficacy niya,"" Galvez explained.
(We will prioritize NCR, we will prioritize Davao because of the increasing number of cases there, we will prioritize Cebu, we will prioritize areas like Bacolod which were badly hit by COVID-19, so we can immediately know the efficacy of the vaccine.)
In said areas, those sectors previously identified by Duterte will be given priority - the poor, those who are vulnerable, the police, military as well as others who are considered as frontline workers.
""Then from geographical, magiging sectoral. Meaning kung sino ang priority natin, for example sa Metro Manila, 'yung urban poor, uunahin po natin doon. Yung vulnerable, uunahin po natin doon, 'yung mga sundalo naka-assign sa NCR, uunahin po natin. Saka 'yung essential workers,"" Galvez said.(From geographical, we will then administer the vaccine by sector. This means we will give priority to those sectors previously identified by the government. Those who are vulnerable will be given priority, the soldiers who are deployed in NCR, we will prioritize them, as well as the essential workers.)
The Department of Health said first in the priority to receive the COVID-19 vaccine are frontline health workers, numbering over 1.7 million.
They are followed by indigent senior citizens (over 3.7 million), remaining senior citizens (over 5.6 million), remaining indigent population (nearly 13 million), and uniformed personnel (over half a million).
Officials project the first batch of COVID-19 vaccine to arrive in the country by the second quarter of 2021.
As of Monday, the novel coronavirus has so far sickened 420,614 people in the Philippines. The tally includes 8,173 deaths, 386,604 recoveries, and 25,837 active cases.
COVID-19 cases in PH breach 420,000; daily tallies ‘plateau’ below 2,000 for 2 weeks now
The new coronavirus is believed to have first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.
Based on the latest tally of the US-based Johns Hopkins University, more than 58.6 million people across the world have been infected by the COVID-19 virus, with 1.38 million deaths.
Treatment and vaccine for the disease are still being developed, but recent trials of pharmaceutical firms Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca have shown encouraging results.

Measles outbreak declared in 3 more regions
Measles outbreak declared in NCR, Central Luzon
In a statement released Wednesday, the Philippine Pediatric Society and the Pediatric Infectious Disease Society of the Philippines urged parents to have their babies vaccinated at 6 months old.
The doctors advised parents to provide the first dose of measles-containing vaccine (monovalent measles, MR, MMR) earlier than the usual 9 months.
For children who received the first dose of measles-containing vaccine at age younger than 12 months, they can get two additional doses of MR or MMR, minimum of 4 weeks apart, beginning at 1 year old.
Children older than 12 months of age, and adults without a history of measles, not pregnant or planning to become pregnant in 4 weeks and with no allergic reaction to a previous dose of measles-containing vaccine, are advised to get a dose of monovalent measles, MR or MMR. A second dose of vaccine may also be given to complete the 2-dose schedule.
The Department of Health on Wednesday confirmed outbreaks of measles in the National Capital Region (NCR) and in Central Luzon. The outbreak declaration has been expanded to Calabarzon, Western Visayas, and Central Visayas on Thursday.
Cases of measles, locally known as ""tigdas,"" in NCR rose by 550 percent from January 1 to February 6, 2019 compared to the same period last year, said Health Secretary Francisco Duque.
The wider outbreak declaration aims to ""strengthen surveillance of new cases and alert mothers and caregivers to be more vigilant,"" Duque told reporters.
As of Jan. 26, Calabarzon tallied 575 measles cases and 9 deaths, said DOH.
Meanwhile, Western Visayas had 104 cases and 3 deaths and Central Visayas had 71 cases and 1 death.
Metro Manila logged 441 cases and 5 deaths while Central Luzon had 192 cases and 4 deaths, DOH said.",abscbn

OCTA researchers flag infections spike in Pasay
MANILA—The COVID-19 positivity rate in Metro Manila is rising steadily as daily coronavirus cases continue to increase, too, analysts said Friday, sounding the alarm on a possible ""overwhelming"" surge of infections in the National Capital Region (NCR).
The OCTA Research Group said in a report that the number of new COVID-19 cases in the NCR continued to increase, as it tallied over 900 new infections per day from February 26 to March 4. According to the analysts, the ratio of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the region increased to an average of 7 percent over the past 7 days and has risen by 1-percentage point every week.
In Pasay City alone, the group noted 150 new COVID-19 cases were logged from February 26 to March 4, the ""highest average daily new cases"" there. Besides Pasay, other cities in Metro Manila recorded ""marginal"" increase in coronavirus infections, the OCTA said.
""Based on our analysis of the data and the past trends in the NCR, we believe that a surge in its early stages has already started in some LGUs in the region,"" the research group said.
""Unlike past surges experienced, the current surge has spread very quickly in a short period. The increase in cases and the reproduction number indicates that the virus is already spreading exponentially in several LGUs in the region.
The single-day tally of COVID-19 cases in the Philippines reached 3,045 Friday, the highest since October 16, 2020. Analysts have been pointing out that cases in some areas of Metro Manila and Region 7 continue to increase.
Philippines logs 3,045 more COVID-19 cases, highest since October
The OCTA believes the surge of cases in Metro Manila could have been caused by the COVID-19 variants that have entered the country, including the UK and South African strains, which can overwhelm the region if ignored.

""It is important to stress the urgency of the situation as the UK and South African variants, which have already been identified in the NCR, are game-changing variants because they are more contagious and lethal and can potentially undermine our vaccination program,"" the analysts stressed.
""The priority now is to contain or mitigate the spread of these more contagious and lethal variants apart from preventing the surge in the region from becoming full-blown.""
WATCH: PH daily COVID-19 cases hit record high in 5 months amid vaccination drive
While the surge in the NCR is a serious problem, it can be abated or even reversed if it is addressed by national and local government officials, private sector and the public, the OCTA said.
""To achieve this, we need to act as one and we need to act now while the situation in the region is still manageable,"" the group emphasized, urging national government and local government officials in Metro Manila to further intensify efforts and expand COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, isolation, and localized lockdowns to curb the transmission of the deadly disease.
The cities of Cebu, Lapu Lapu, Mandaue, Davao, Baguio and Bacoor were also exhorted to do the same due to their number of daily COVID-19 cases.
""Furthermore, in the identified NCR LGUs, the implementation of more effective localized lockdowns with stricter border controls are urgently needed to suppress further viral transmissions. Effective and more stringent border controls must be observed to mitigate
COVID-19 transmissions from the NCR and between provinces and prevent the spread of the virus,"" OCTA said.
Regulations for int'l travelers must be re-evaluated
The researchers believe the surge in COVID-19 cases in the affected cities was caused by community transmission, likely aggravated by relaxation of crowd and border controls, contact tracing and coronavirus testing.
""Furthermore, some citizens' deteriorating compliance with the minimum health standard due to pandemic fatigue and/or the failure of LGUs to monitor and enforce GCQ (general community quarantine) regulations have also contributed to spikes, especially in metropolitan areas,"" the analysts said, stressing the importance of discipline in observing minimum health standards set by government.
""We also exhort the national and local governments to strictly monitor and enforce compliance with minimum health standards, such as physical distancing, wearing of face mask and face shields and proper hygiene, and to discourage large gatherings to reverse the increase in transmissions at the community level.""
The OCTA called on national government to enhance the capacity of the Philippine healthcare system, such as boosting manpower, increasing hospital equipment, and building more isolation facilities as the country sets to further reopen its economy and relax more restrictions placed to contain COVID-19 transmission.
The group also recommended government's re-evaluation of protocols for international travelers entering the Philippines.
""While we recognize the need to lift the travel ban and allow returning overseas Filipinos (ROFs) and foreign travelers to travel to the country, it is also apparent that there has been some level of ineffectiveness in the implementation of these protocols, or that perhaps we need to recalibrate some of our guidelines for the testing and quarantine of International travelers,"" the analysts advised.
""The fact that SARS-Cov2 variants of foreign origin have entered our country supports this call for stricter guidelines and/or stricter implementation of the existing guidelines.""
The OCTA spurred health workers and other frontliners in Metro Manila and other regions to get vaccinated against the infectious pathogen, as the group projects another surge of COVID-19 cases in the next few weeks.
The Philippines began its vaccination rollout on Monday after receiving its first supply of COVID-19 vaccines, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 doses from Beijing-based drugmaker Sinovac Biotech, on Sunday.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/23/21/measles-polio-vaccination-drive-affected-by-covid-19-lockdown-fears-of-infection-doh,Measles,"Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News",Feb 23 2021 08:52 PM,"MANILA — The Philippines is still having difficulty reaching its target number of children for measles and polio vaccinations as some areas have been locked down due to the spread of COVID-19, the Department of Health said on Tuesday.Adding to the problem is the fear of some parents, said Dr. Beverly Ho, director of the DOH’s Health Promotion Bureau.
“What we're still getting from the ground is that a lot of them are afraid to go to the health centers because they're afraid for the safety of them and their kids. Baka makakuha sila ng (They might get infected with) COVID, so they're not going to the centers,” Ho said during a media briefing.
“We want to reassure everyone that as long as we're able to practice our minimum public health standards - there are protocols in place in health center, so that the mother and the baby are protected,” she added, explaining that they would only need to stay in the health center for 15 minutes during the vaccination.
The DOH and participating local government units are holding a mass immunization campaign for the whole month of February to prevent another measles outbreak from happening, and to further stop the spread of polio.
PH to hold measles, polio mass vaccination in NCR, Regions 3, 4A, Visayas
For the measles-rubella vaccine, the DOH targeted 5.1 million children to be vaccinated, of whom, almost 1.4 million have yet to be reached.
For the oral polio vaccine, almost 4.7 million children are targeted, but around 1.3 million children that have yet to receive it.
“Unfortunately, for some of the barangays in these areas, there has been increasing COVID-19 cases, and this puts some of the areas in lockdown. And that compromises the ability of our vaccination team to go into those areas,” Ho said as she enumerated the participating regions — National Capital Region, Region 3, 4A, 6, 7, and 8.
The health official said the vaccinators will push through with the campaign as soon as the lockdowns are lifted.Among the regions with the highest number of vaccination coverage is Region 3, with 85% of its target reached for oral polio vaccine and measles vaccine.
In case the lockdowns continue until after February, Ho said parents can still bring their children to health centers to be vaccinated.
After this mass immunization campaign, the agency will push for a higher rate of routine immunization since it is very “taxing” on health workers and local government units to do house-to-house vaccinations, she said.

MANILA - Former Health Secretary Paulyn Jean Ubial on Thursday said she was ""pressured"" by Congress to expand government's controversial dengue immunization program even after ""safety questions"" were raised.
""During the budget hearing, there was a lot of pressure from Congress to expand it to other parts of the country that have high burden for dengue, in particular Region 7,"" Ubial said during a joint hearing of the Senate Blue Ribbon and Health & Demography Committees.
Before Ubial was appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as health chief in July 2016, about 489,000 children were given the Dengvaxia vaccine under the term of Ubial's predecessor, former Health Secretary Janet Garin.
""I immediately released a memorandum to halt the administration of the vaccine in Region 3 and NCR (National Capital Region). I was very vocal as assistant secretary that I was opposing the introduction of the dengue vaccine to a large portion of the population,"" Ubial said.
Ubial said she did not want to expand the coverage of the dengue immunization program due to ""safety questions"" about the vaccine.
""I wanted to stick with the decision of the first expert panel to give second doses only to those who received the first dose. After which, we will stop all immunization, look at the pilot case, look at the data and decide on how to move the program forward,"" she said.
But Ubial said she changed her mind after lawmakers pushed for the program's expansion during budget deliberations in 2016.
""I was pushed, 'Why cant you have a second opinion?'"" Ubial said.
The former health chief said she convened a second expert panel before heeding Congress' call to have more Filipino children vaccinated with Dengvaxia.
""The recommendation of the second expert panel was to expand to other areas with high dengue burden,"" she said.
Under the expanded dengue program, 280,000 children from Central Visayas were given the vaccine, Ubial said.
Sanofi's Dengvaxia triggered a health scare in the Philippines last month after the drug maker admitted that the vaccine could lead to ""more cases of severe disease"" if given to those who have not had dengue before.

Rodriguez Memorial Hospital (DJNRMH) or Tala Hospital in Caloocan City expects the delivery on Sunday of around 800 vials of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer, its chief said Thursday.
“Tentative, possible arrival is Sunday. ‘Yung time, wala pang binibigay sa amin na estimated time of arrival,” Dr. Fritz Famaran told ABS-CBN News.
(The tentative, possible arrival is Sunday. We were not yet given the estimated time of arrival.)
""Ang (The) first and second dose can be handled by the ultra low freezer of the hospital. Isang bagsakan lang ito (This will be a one-time delivery),” he added.
The DJNRMH is among four hospitals, all in Metro Manila, whose staff will be prioritized in the distribution of COVID-19 shots upon arrival. The three others are the Philippine General Hospital in Manila City, and the Lung Center of the Philippines and East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City.
Health workers in 4 NCR hospitals are on top of COVID-19 vaccination list
Officials earlier have estimated the delivery in the country of COVID-19 vaccine supplies from the COVAX facility, which include those from Pfizer, in the second or third week of the month.
DOH: No confirmed date of COVID-19 vaccine arrival, start of inoculations
On Thursday, Presidential spokesman Harry Roque told a news briefing that there is no tentative arrival date yet for the first batch of 117,000 Pfizer shots from the COVAX Facility.
""Inaasahan po natin, hindi matatapos ang buwan ng Pebrero at darating din ang paunang shipment galing sa COVAX Facility,"" he said.(We expect that February will not end without an initial shipment from the COVAX Facility.)
Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine has been granted emergency use authority in the Philippines by the Food and Drug Administration.
A vial of it is good for 5 individuals, each with a single dose, according to Famaran.
“One vial, idi-dilute mo yun. Kukunin mo dun is .3 ml. So, that's .3 (ml) times 5,"" he explained.
(You first dilute. Then, you extract .3 ml for each dose.)
TALA HOSPITAL’S COLD CHAIN FACILITY PREPS
According to Felina Jane Barongan, officer-in-charge of the hospital's pharmacy, maintaining the hospital’s cold chain is critical for Pfizer’s vaccines.
Pfizer's vaccine, which uses new messenger RNA-based technology, has to be kept in a -70 degrees Celsius freezer, unlike the other COVID-19 vaccines. It has the highest efficacy rate at 95 percent, based on current data.

Barongan said the hospital’s ultra-low freezer has been set to -70 degrees Celsius earlier this week in preparation for the vaccines’ arrival.
“Nag-set na tayo rito ng -70 (degrees Celsius). Pagkatumaas ‘yong temperatura, nag-aalarm yung freezer, audible alarm na maririnig sa buong pharmacy,” she said.
(We already set the temperature to -70 degrees Celsius. Once the temperature rises, the freezer will sound an alarm that can be heard in the entire pharmacy.)
Preparing the vaccines includes the thawing process of the vials that can last 3 to 4 hours inside a refrigerator with a temperature of 2 to 8 degrees Celsius. Afterwards, the vials will need an additional 30 minutes under room temperature before the actual administration of the vaccine, she explained.Once taken out of the refrigerator, Pfizer’s vaccines should be opened within 2 hours. And once diluted, the vaccine should be administered to an individual within 6 hours.“Kung ano lang yung kailangan, yun lang ang ilalabas sa freezer,” she pointed out.
(We will only get from the freezer the exact number of vaccines we will need.)
“Yung vaccine na ito is different from other vaccines. Para ma-maintain natin yung integrity and efficacy of the vaccine, kailangan natin siya ihiwalay sa iba, kasi hindi tayo basta-basta. Kumbaga, masuwerte kami, nabigyan kami ng mga vaccines na ito,” she said.
(To maintain the integrity and efficacy of the vaccine, we need to separate it from the others... We are lucky to be receiving these vaccines.)On Thursday, a total of 1,600 employees have already registered in their vaccine masterlist, of whom, 86 percent said they agreed to recieve the shots, according to Famaran.The hospital chief said the reason for some hesitancy by some employees stem from the supposed side effects of the vaccines, and no longer about the brand.Some health workers wary of COVID-19 vaccine, but those in favor outnumber them - polls

“Kahit na Pfizer, kasi 'di ba, may mga media news na sabi gumamit ng Pfizer, medyo hindi maganda, unverified yung kanilang reports pertaining to the side effects of the vaccine,” he said.
Famaran said he has allotted slots for those who might change their mind at the last minute.
He also has yet to see reports on employees who might have allergic reactions to the vaccine.
Five staff of the hospital are currently confined in the facility due to COVID-19. Famaran said they contracted the disease outside of the hospital

MANILA — The OCTA Group on Monday said it is seeing a continued increase in COVID-19 cases in some parts of the National Capital Region (NCR), which may push the country's total to 665,000 by the end of the month.
This as the country finally started its rollout of COVID-19 vaccines using donations from China.

In a written report, professors from the University of the Philippines and the University of Santo Tomas who comprise the research group said that the NCR averaged 942 daily cases in the last 4 days.
“Before tumaas, nag-average tayo ng 400 cases per day sa Metro Manila. Ngayon, for the past 4 days, ang average natin 900. So, dumoble or more pa nga,"" Dr. Guido David, an OCTA Fellow, told ABS-CBN in a video call.
""Mabilis itong pagtaas ng cases,” he noted.(Before the increase in cases, we were averaging 400 cases per day in Metro Manila. Now, for the past 4 days, our average doubled to 900. The increase is fast.)
The OCTA Group bases its analysis on the R naught or reproduction number of COVID-19. A reproduction number of more than 1 means that the infection is spreading to more people since one infected person can infect one or more people.
The group said the reproduction number for NCR, home to roughly a tenth of the country's a little over 100 million population, increased to 1.5.
Asked what could be the cause of the spike in cases, David said, “Meron kaming strong suspicion na ito (UK variant) yung nagda-drive ng transmission sa mga areas na 'yan.”
(We have a strong suspicion that the UK variant is driving the transmission in those areas.)
The UK variant, which has been detected in the Philippines, is said to be more transmissible. So far, 62 cases of such variant have been recorded in the country.
David said the rise in COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila follows a pattern similar to that of Cebu City and Mountain Province, where the UK variant was detected.
The NCR cities that recorded “steep upward trends” are Pasay, Quezon, Manila, Makati, Malabon, Taguig, Paranaque and Navotas.
The OCTA Group said Valenzuela, Caloocan and Las Pinas had a smaller increase in new cases.
Among cities, Cebu City still has the most number of new cases per day at around 200. Other cities outside Metro Manila included in the Top 10 areas reporting the most number of new cases are Lapu-Lapu, Davao and Mandaue.
“Under the current trend, the number of new COVID-19 cases per day (for NCR) will increase from its current average daily value of 770 to 2,200 by the end of March 2021,” the OCTA Group said.
The country is expected to reach 665,000 total cases and 14,000 total deaths if the Philippines is unable to curb the spread of the disease.
As of Monday, the country's total infections stood at 578,381, including 12,322 deaths.
Over the weekend, the ABS-CBN Data Analytics pointed out the almost 8% positivity rate in the country, with NCR and Region 7 also showing a surge.

David said that with the continued increase in cases, Filipinos should strictly follow health protocols such as the wearing of masks and physical distancing.“Itong vaccine rollout, hindi natin makikita ang effects nito sa number of cases,” he said. “Sa ibang countries, nakapag-vaccinate sila ng 20% of the population bago nakakita ng decrease of cases.”
(We won’t see the effects of the vaccine rollout in the number of cases for now… In other countries, they only saw a decrease in cases when they vaccinated 20% of their population.)
The government aims to vaccinate 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year, depending on the supply of vaccines, to achieve herd immunity against the virus.

Here, precious life-saving vaccines are tightly guarded. Access is restricted. Temperatures are meticulously inspected round the clock.
Among the cache are vials of Dengvaxia, the world’s first dengue vaccine.
The Philippine government procured 3 million doses in 2015 for P3 billion to strengthen its anti-dengue campaign. It was meant to immunize one million public school students.
Touted as the world’s first dengue vaccine, the cache of Dengvaxia is a remnant of the previous administration’s school based dengue immunization program.
Today, less than half a million children have been vaccinated. An estimated P1.44 billion worth of vaccines continue to sit idly in the ice-cold storage.
Boxes of Dengvaxia stored at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City.
First in Asia to ok vaccine
The Department of Health (DOH) had recorded over 200,000 cases of dengue in 2015. Six hundred people have died due to the disease spread through the bite of the Aedes Aegypti mosquito.
By December 2015, the Philippines became the first country in Asia to approve the vaccine for individuals aged between 9 and 45 years old.
For the poor
The target beneficiaries were 9-year-old fourth graders in public schools in the National Capital Region (NCR), Region 3, and Region 4A, areas reported to have the highest incidence of dengue cases in 2015.
Each child was to be given three doses administered in over six-month intervals through a school-based immunization program.
“If the government has money, why not give it for services to the poor?” said former Health Secretary Janette Garin, who was at the helm of the DOH back then.
Too many vaccines?
But data from the DOH show only 729,287 students in Grade 4 fit the criteria, prompting some critics to raise questions about the haste or impropriety in the purchase of more vaccines than needed.
Of that figure, there were only 534,303 students whose parents consented to the immunization.
By the time the first phase of the immunization project was implemented in April, May and June 2016, only 491,990 students showed up.
When the second phase was administered in October, November and December 2016 under the Duterte administration’s Health Secretary Paulyn Ubial, even fewer students--415,681--turned up for vaccination.
The third phase of immunization is ongoing.Huge mistake
Dr. Anthony Leachon, past president of the Philippine College of Physicians, said the previous government should have purchased vaccines based on the number of parents who consented to the vaccination of their children, not the number of target beneficiaries.
“That’s a huge amount of money para magkamali,” said Leachon, a resource person during last year’s congressional hearing on the DOH’s dengue immunization program.
Ubial-Garin row
Garin blamed the low turnout on Ubial.
When she left the DOH, Garin said, one of the first announcements Ubial made was that she would stop the dengue vaccination program.
“Nagkaroon ng misinformation,” Garin said. “She actually kept mentioning that the safety (of Dengvaxia) is questionable, so as a parent matatakot ka talaga.”
But Leachon said the low turnout was a result of the failure of the DOH and the local governments to sufficiently educate the target beneficiaries. “Hindi alam ng mothers, hindi mo na-prepare ang community, so walang magco-consent. Yun ang unang mistake dun eh.”
Ubial’s options
Yet Ubial has been hesitant to expand the program her predecessor started. She said she’s keeping an eye on other dengue vaccines that may become available soon.
“We are looking at efficacy and cost effectiveness,” she said. “There are several vaccines in the process of clinical trials and will be available in the market by 2018, so we’re actually waiting for those vaccines.
There is information they are more effective than the current one we are using.”
Personal vendetta?
Ubial once said the timing of the dengue immunization program was unethical. “We don’t undertake major programs during an election year, maybe it will be promoting certain candidates, but in this case it happened,” she said.
Garin rebuffed Ubial.
”The allegation that it was a political event rather than a health event twisted everybody,” she said, adding Ubial has an axe to grind.
“The efficacy has been tested by experts all over the world- sino pa ang gusto nyang mag test ng efficacy? I think it boils down to personal vendetta.”
Garin was Ubial’s boss in the previous administration.
“Ano ang galit nya sa akin the last few months we were in office? Maybe there were requests that I disapproved, seminars and travels that I had to cut. Sometimes there should be people in the office, hindi pwedeng laging nasa labas kasi walang makaka-trabaho,” she said.
Campaign continues
With or without a vaccine, Ubial vowed the DOH would continue its anti-dengue campaign.
June is dengue-awareness month, and health officials have been advising local communities to search and destroy breeding sites for mosquitos, use mosquito repellants, wear protective clothing, and seek early medical consultation when warning signs of severe dengue occur.
These include abdominal pain, persistent vomiting and bleeding following a fever, headache and rashes.
For all the warning, the number of dengue cases in the country is expected to rise in the coming months.
Few takers?
Ubial finally approved on June 5 a proposal the DOH-Dengue Vaccine Implementation Committee (DVIC) has been pushing since April to offer the vaccines to local governments in NCR for a community-based immunization program.
She approved the expansion of the dengue vaccination program to benefit 100,000 children more in Cebu.
But with all the confusion and controversy, the question remains if there would be any takers.
Nearing expiry
The number of dengue cases in the country is expected to rise in the coming months.
About a third of the vaccines in storage will expire in ten months; the rest, in August 2018.
“After allocating the vaccines…we have projected a large excess supply of Dengue vaccine,” DVIC Executive Director Julius Lecciones wrote Ubial on April 18, 2017.
Lecciones’ proposal was to make use of the vaccines by offering them to four cities in NCR with the highest incidence of dengue: Quezon City, Makati, Manila and Caloocan.
After three more letters to Ubial to follow up the “urgent concern”, the proposal was finally approved on June 5, 2017.
How safe?
Leachon also raised safety issues about the vaccine.
He said it was important to closely monitor vaccinees because some side effects or complications did not surface during the manufacturer’s clinical trials which only involved a small number of volunteers.
Twenty-nine-thousand volunteers received the vaccine during French manufacturer Sanofi Pasteur’s clinical trials that spanned over two decades in 15 countries, including the Philippines.
Not a cure?
The vaccines are not a cure for dengue. Sanofi Pasteur, however, claimed the vaccine boosted immunity to four types of dengue virus, reducing a person’s vulnerability.
DOH statistics show there have been 189 deaths due to dengue in the Philippines between January and May 2017. That figure might have grown more than double by the end of the year based on previous years’ data.Bigger hurdle
The next step is convincing local governments to agree to a community-based immunization program they have to fund.
The bigger hurdle, however, is convincing parents of target beneficiaries to give their consent.
The DVIC aims to inoculate 230,611 indigent children aged 9 to 14 years old. But reports have circulated about children who died the past year after being administered the dengue vaccine. Two children were from Bataan and one was from Bulacan.Deaths coincidental
Ubial said a “working committee” that reviews adverse events following immunization had ruled the dengue vaccine had nothing to do with the deaths.
“They came out with their report that the deaths are coincidental, they are not related to Dengvaxia,” Ubial said.
But because of the negative publicity, Lecciones said it wouldn’t be easy to find takers for the vaccine.
If either Quezon City, Makati, Manila or Caloocan reject the proposal, the DVIC would offer the vaccines to other areas like Marikina and Malabon, where a high number of dengue cases have been reported.
Post-vaccination monitor
Leachon has welcomed the move to make use of already available vaccines.
But Leachon said there should be an honest-to-goodness monitoring of individuals post vaccination, even if the Food and Drug Administration has already granted it a Certificate of Product Registration.
“The certificate of product registration is a license to market the product but there is no guarantee it will not be pulled out. That depends on findings in the future.”
Charge to experience
He advised against using up all the excess vaccines, instead suggesting that inoculation be limited to 100,000 children or less in NCR, where there would be easy access to doctors and health facilities in case of complications. “Ang issue ko ay safety, hindi sa akin yung kung masasayang eh. You just have to charge it to experience.”
Seropositive
Leachon said the target beneficiaries must be tested prior to vaccination to determine who among them have previously been exposed to one of the four dengue viruses.
“Kapag hindi ka pa na-eexpose, seronegative ka,” he said, referring to a study led by Neil Ferguson, director of the MRC Center for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial College London published in Science online journal.
“Kapag na-expose ka na, seropositive ka. Ayon sa pag-aaral, kapag hindi ka pa na eexpose at nabigyan ka ng dose na ito, may posibilidad na in three years, magkakaroon ka ng severe hemorrhagic dengue. Yung mga na-expose na, kung magka-dengue, hindi na ganun ka-tindi.”
Wanted: Holistic approach
The vaccine is not a silver bullet.
The World Health Organization said its introduction to areas with a high burden of disease must be part of a comprehensive dengue prevention strategy.
“Dengue is not just a DOH concern, it’s an environmental concern, an LGU concern,” Leachon said.
“It’s everybody’s concern. Kahit na paliguan mo ng bakuna ang entire population at gumastos ka ng bilyun, pero malamok at madumi pa rin ang environment mo, hindi mareresolba yun. It’s mosquito and vector control,” he said.",abscbn

Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital, the only remaining COVID-19 referral center for purely mild to critical cases, will vaccinate some 1,911 workers in a span of 7 days, according to its medical director Alfonso Famaran.
The figure includes non-medical frontliners such as security guards and janitorial personnel, Famaran said.
""Ang aming vaccination acceptance percentage is around 90 percent po... 'Yung natitirang 10 percent ang kanila hong agam-agam para sa pagpapabakuna ang most common reason nila is yung side effects ng vaccine,"" he told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo.

The hospital is conducting information campaign to address vaccine hesitancy, he added.
The vaccination procedure takes around 53 minutes, including the observation period for initial side effects, Famaran said.
The Lung Center of the Philippines has also launched simulations for the arrival of the vaccines, said spokesperson Norbert Francisco.
""Kailangan surgical precision ang kilos ng mga tao kaya bawat munting hakbang kailangan may nakatutok,"" he told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo.

""Pinag-aaralan na natin ang ibang mga bansa na kung saan mayroong mandatory immunization na ang mga magulang dapat dalhin talaga nila ang mga anak nila sa mga health centers,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told ""Bandila sa DZMM.""
He said there is an existing executive order signed in 2007 by former President and now House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, which requires complete vaccination of children before entering preschool and primary school.
""Ang problema walang sanction. Sinabi lang na it will ensure, pero wala namang nakalagay na kapag ka hindi dinala ng magulang ay may karampatang penalties o kaparusahan,"" Duque said.
The health chief made the rounds Friday in some hospitals in Metro Manila to check on the patients.
Asked why some parents refused their children to be vaccinated, Duque said parents cited the scrapped anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia as the major reason.
Last year, the government recalled the anti-dengue vaccine after its manufacturer, France's Sanofi-Pasteur, said it could cause severe symptoms if given to those who have not had the mosquito-borne disease.
""Ang madalas sabihin nila ay 'yun na nga natakot sila dahil nga doon sa nangyari sa Dengvaxia. Nalito sila na ang Dengvaxia ay ibang klaseng bakuna 'yan,"" he said.
He added, ""Hindi nila naintindihan na ang Dengvaxia, ibang isyu 'yan. Hindi 'yan dapat nakaapekto, madungisan ating immunization program dahil lang sa isang kontrobersiya dulot ng Dengvaxia.""
After immunization coverage fell, some 90 percent of those infected with measles nationwide are unvaccinated, DOH had said.

MANILA — Coronavirus infections in the Philippines climbed to 600,428 on Tuesday after the Department of Health (DOH) reported 2,668 new COVID-19 cases.
During the past few days, the country was logging more than 3,000 daily cases.
Tuesday's tally did not include data from 8 laboratories that failed to submit results on time.The DOH also announced 7 new COVID-related deaths or a total of 12,528 fatalities, accounting for 2.09 percent of the cumulative total cases.
There are also 171 new recovered patients or a total of 546,078 recoveries.
Active cases in the country stood at 41,822, or 7 percent of the cumulative total.
Of those currently battling the disease, 91.6% have mild symptoms, 3.9% are asymptomatic, 1.8% are in critical condition, 1.9% have severe symptoms, and 0.8% have moderate symptoms.
A total of 3 cases, all tagged as recovered, were removed from the official tally for being duplicate entries.
There were also 2 cases tagged as recovered that turned out to be deaths.
The increase in cases in the country has been mainly driven by a spike in infections in the National Capital Region and other areas such cities in Cebu.
The World Health Organization on Tuesday said the surge is not actually considered a second wave since the Philippines never really flattened its cases. The international body called it “another spike in the ongoing wave.”
The WHO said that while more transmissible variants have been detected in the Philippines, their number is small compared to the total.
The DOH has repeatedly said that the increase in cases is due to the non-compliance in health protocols, aggravated by the variants. But the WHO also mentioned the need for quicker and more unified local government response.READ: Not 2nd wave: Rise of COVID cases in NCR a ‘spike’ in ongoing wave, says WHO
A survey by the OCTA Research Group showed that while majority of Filipinos wear face masks, only 67% said they were able to practice physical distancing. This was higher at 82% in Metro Manila.

The OCTA Group recently estimated that new cases in the country might reach 5,000 to 6,000 per day, with 2,000 up to 3,000 of those coming from Metro Manila.
The group called for local governments to further intensify COVID-response efforts, which includes localized lockdowns, expanded testing and contact tracing.

This month marks one year since Metro Manila and other parts of the country were placed under community quarantine to curb the spread of the disease.
The country is on Week 2 of its COVID-19 vaccination rollout, using products from Sinovac and AstraZeneca.
The Philippines' first COVID-19 case was confirmed on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.
There are almost 48.2 million people currently infected with COVID-19 worldwide. Since the start of the pandemic, almost 117.2 million people have contracted the disease, according to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus dashboard. Of those, 2.6 million have died and 66.4 million have recovered.

Cases of measles, locally known as ""tigdas,"" in NCR rose by 550 percent from January 1 to February 6, 2019 compared to the same period last year, said Health Secretary Francisco Duque.
The DOH recorded 196 cases of measles in NCR from January 1 to February 6 this year, higher than the 20 cases recorded in the same period last year.
Since January, at least 55 deaths from measles were recorded at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila, most of them children aged 3 months to 4 years old.
At least 248 children were being treated for the disease at the San Lazaro Hospital, as of Tuesday morning.
In Central Luzon, Dr. Jesse Fantone, chief of the DOH's Regional Epidemiology and Surveillance Unit, confirmed the outbreak.
""Yes, it’s an outbreak,"" Fantone said.
As of Feb. 2, the DOH in Central Luzon has recorded 442 suspected cases of measles.
Speaking to ANC, DOH spokesperson Roland Domingo said several other regions are also under ""tight watch"" for a measles outbreak.
Among these are the Ilocos Region, Cagayan Valley, Cordillera Administrative Region, and the Caraga Region.
Health Undersecretary Eric Domingo earlier urged parents to have their children vaccinated against the infectious disease.
Vaccine for measles are free in local health centers, the DOH reiterated.
The DOH, in a statement, urged the public to bring all suspected cases to the nearest health facility for early treatment.
Unvaccinated young children are at highest risk of measles, an airborne disease that infects the respiratory tract, and its complications include severe diarrhea, pneumonia, blindness, and even death.
More than 2 million Filipino children are at risk of getting infected with measles due to lack of immunization, Dr. Ruby Constantino, director of the DOH Disease Prevention and Control Bureau earlier said.
The Philippines saw a four-fold jump in measles cases from 4,000 cases in 2017 to 21,000 cases last year.Constantino attributed the increase to the Dengvaxia scare which eroded Filipinos' trust in vaccines.

FDA: Efficacy ng Sinovac, bumababa sa health workers na mas exposed sa COVID-19
This prompted the DOH to consult the NITAG for its recommendation on how to distribute the vaccine given its lower efficacy among health workers and the current prioritization framework of the government.
“The DOH, the Food and Drug Administration and our panel of experts concurred that current available evidence is enough to establish that the vaccine is safe for use,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a briefing on Friday with members of the NITAG and the DOH Technical Advisory Group (TAG).
“NITAG and the TAG (technical advisory group) has deemed it sufficient to recommend the use of the vaccine for health care workers as it bears to reiterate that our goal for prioritizing health care workers for vaccination is to reduce morbidity and mortality among their group, while they maintain the most critical essential health services,” she added.
Vergeire said the NITAG already presented the recommendation to the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on COVID-19 response.
“Just this morning we presented to the IATF and we got approval already. This will also be presented to the President,” she said.This approval “is an assurance that the use of Sinovac is safe and beneficial to our healthcare workers,” said Palace spokesman Harry Roque.“As we have said in many occasions, healthcare workers are the most critical frontliners in our fight against COVID-19 and they remain at the top of our priority list for vaccination,” Roque said in a statement.“We are confident that many of our healthcare workers would get themselves inoculated to boost public confidence in our mass vaccination program against the coronavirus,” he added.Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine will be the first to be rolled out in the Philippines. First in line are health workers in COVID-dedicated hospitals. Vergeire said they are still finalizing which hospitals will receive the jabs.
ALLOWED TO WAIT
The DOH and its advisory groups said that health workers may decline or choose to wait for another vaccine. It won’t affect their priority status.
However, Dr. Nina Castillo-Carandang said the health workers’ readiness to accept COVID-19 vaccines is expected to affect vaccine confidence among the general public.
“If health care workers are reluctant to accept vaccination then that also sends a signal to the general public. We'd like to offer this opportunity for health care workers, if they're willing to do so to have themselves vaccinated with Sinovac,” she said.
Castillo-Carandang said that while health workers may wait for another brand, there is no assurance when the next one would arrive.
Health workers have expressed concern over the reported low efficacy rate of the Sinovac vaccine.
SAFE VACCINE
Dr. Maria Consorcia Quizon, another NITAG member, said Sinovac is a “safe vaccine.”
“[Sinovac] is safe for use for health care workers. We need to protect them. Since ito ang available ngayon, kailangan nating gamitin para sa kanila (Since this is the one available now, then we must use it for them),” Quizon said.
Vergeire pointed out that safety and efficacy are measured separately and that studies have shown that Sinovac’s vaccine is safe.
Dr. John Wong, a member of the DOH TAG, said while the vaccine’s overall efficacy rate for health workers aged 18 to 59 was at around 50%, it has higher efficacy against more severe cases of the disease.
He said for moderate cases, the efficacy was at 72%, and for severe cases it was at 100%.
“If we had this vaccine last year in NCR, we could have averted 42 health worker deaths and averted 3,300 cases,” he said.
The FDA previously said that the vaccine, which used the traditional inactivated virus platform, only results in common vaccination side effects although more time is needed for observation.
Asked if the DOH will still wait for the recommendation of the Health Technology Assessment Council, an independent advisory group, a member of the NITAG said it is not necessary since the first batch of 600,000 Sinovac vaccine doses were donated.
Vergeire said the vaccines of Sinovac that will arrive on Sunday will be in single dose vials and will not require special syringes.

MANILA - Several cities in the capital region have secured hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses each from British drugmaker AstraZeneca, officials said Monday.
Valenzuela City has ordered an initial 640,000 doses for more than 320,000 or 70 percent of its adult population, Mayor Rex Gatchalian said. The city has begun its logistics and supply chain preparation for the rollout expected in the second half of the year, he said.
Caloocan City secured 600,000 doses for 300,000 persons or 35 percent or of its adult population, according to Mayor Oscar Malapitan.
The local government is negotiating with other drug manufacturers to hike supply as it has a P1 billion fund.
Navotas City also ordered 100,000 doses from AstraZeneca which is enough for 50,000 residents, Mayor Toby Tiangco said.
Pasig City procured 400,000 vaccine doses worth P100 million, Mayor Vico Sotto earlier said.

MANILA - The Philippine government will ensure the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines that will enter the country, the Department of Health said Thursday when asked whether frontliners can choose which vaccine will be injected to them.
The development comes with next month's expected delivery of Sinovac vaccines and the beginning of the World Health Organization's COVAX facility immunization program.

""Kung ano po ang ibibigay natin sa ating healthcare workers 'di po tayo magkakaroon ng chance or pagkakataon na makakapili sila. Kung ano po ang ma-assign 'yun po ang maibibigay,"" DOH spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire told ANC's Headstart.
(Healthcare workers won't be given a chance to choose, whatever is assigned to them will be given to them.)
""Alam po natin limitado po ang ating supplies (We know the supplies are limited)...Whatever vaccines will come into the country, the government will guarantee it will be safe and it will provide the protection that we need.""

Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said healthworkers may sign a waiver refusing the vaccine assigned to them which will move them to the end of the immunization list.
""Kunyari nauna ang Sinovac (If Sinovac arrives first) and it’s NCR frontliners, it’s either you take it or you don’t. You sign a waiver saying you understand, you waive your slot in the queue,"" he told ANC in a separate interview.
Giving healthworkers the option to choose their vaccine will be ""very tedious,"" said Vergeire.
She added that the latest Brazil study on the efficacy of Sinovac's vaccine candidate states that it prevents by 50 percent the risk of getting infected and also lessens chances of hospitalization.

MANILA — Sinovac’s COVID-19 vaccine is not recommended for health workers, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday as it announced the approval of the product for emergency use in the Philippines.
“It has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4% when used on health care workers exposed to COVID-19. Therefore, it is not recommended for use in this group,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
Health workers, numbering 1,762,994, top the country's list of priority sectors to receive COVID-19 vaccines once supplies arrive.
LIST: Sub-groups in COVID-19 vaccination priority
Palace says 24.6 million Filipinos to be prioritized in coronavirus vaccination
Health workers in 4 NCR hospitals are on top of COVID-19 vaccination list
Domingo said that Phase III clinical trials done in different countries showed that Sinovac's vaccine has an efficacy rate of 65.3% based on trials in Indonesia, and up to 91.2% based on trials done in Turkey. The trials only involve adults aged 18 to 59 years.
Asked for more information on why health workers are advised not to receive the vaccine, Domingo said, “Ang nakita kasi sa trial sa Brazil, binigay ito sa mga health workers na nagtatrabaho sa hospitals na nagti-treat ng COVID, ay 50.4% ang efficacy n'ya.”
“Mas mabuti naman po iyon kaysa sa wala. Pero ang rekomendasyon ng ating mga experts ay hindi po ito ang pinakamagandang bakuna para sa kanila,” he added.(What they saw in Brazil is that when it was given to health workers working in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, the vaccine only had an efficacy rate of 50.4%. This is better than nothing, but the recommendation of experts is that it is not the best vaccine for health workers.)
The vaccine's efficacy rate is between 63 percent to 91 percent on members of the community who are not healthworkers, Domingo told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo Tuesday,
""Maganda po talaga. Ang mga pagaaral po nila sa mga regular na mamamayan sa community...na hindi naman po exposed na very highly concentrated sa COVID-19 ay maganda ang kaniyang protection rate, umaabot ng 91 percent,"" he said.
(It's good. Their studies on regular members of the community...who are not exposed in areas highly concentrated with COVID-19 is it has a good protection rate that goes up to 91 percent.)

Before the FDA approval of Sinovac, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the firm's vaccine will most likely be the first to arrive in the Philippines this month.
Duque said it will take China 3 to 5 days to prepare the shipment of 600,000 doses it is donating to the Philippines.
When Presidential spokesman Harry Roque first announced over a week ago that the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines on Tuesday, Feb. 23, has been etched in stone, he said 100,000 doses of those will go to the Philippine military.
The delivery of the said supply is expected to be delayed, however, following China's decision to await first the FDA's issuance of an emergency use authorization (EUA).

The FDA has already granted EUA to the vaccines of Pfizer and AstraZeneca, but the shipment of the former under the COVAX Facility has been delayed as well due to the lack then of an indemnification agreement.

ECONOMIC WORKERS FIRST?
When Sinovac's vaccine arrives, Domingo told ABS-CBN News that the Department of Health will set the prioritization for its recipients, excluding health workers.
Roque said that the Interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (iNITAG) will meet later Monday to tackle a possible revision in the priority list of recipients for the Sinovac jabs.
“Siguro, kinakailangan nilang baguhin muna iyong ating list of priorities,” he said in a separate briefing.
(Perhaps, they need to first change our list of priorities.)
“Baka mauna na iyong ating tinatawag na economic frontliners na kasama po ng ating kasundaluhan.”(Our so-called economic frontliners might go first with our military.)
Economic frontliners include those who continued to work during last year’s enhance community quarantine, the strictest of 4 lockdown levels in the country, Roque said.Establishments like supermarkets, groceries, drugstores, and other service-oriented centers were allowed to operate during the ECQ.
The DOH has yet to respond to questions on whether it will follow the FDA’s recommendation and what will happen if Sinovac’s vaccines arrive first in the country.
Nearly 15,000 health workers in the Philippines have been infected with COVID-19, of whom, 249 were battling the disease, as of Feb. 20.
At the peak of the outbreak, health workers comprised 20% of infected individuals in the country. It has since gone down to 3%, although health workers remain among those most exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
Meanwhile, recipients of the 100,000 doses from Sinovac's donation intended for the Department of National Defense and its bureaus will be administered by the Veterans Medical Center and V. Luna Medical Center, according to Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana.
He clarified that the Armed Forces of the Philippines will not received any of those.
""Two doses kasi, kaya 50,000 lang ang kaya ng 100K. Tama lang sa DND personnel and their families,"" said Lorenzana.
(Since it requires two doses, only 50,000 recipients can avail of the 100,000 doses. It's just right for DND personnel and their families.)
The defense chief earlier expressed willingness to be inoculated with Sinovac's vaccine. But, upon learning that he doesn't fall within the recommended age range of recipients, he said he would wait for the next vaccine instead.

“Ang gagawin namin by end of January we will make sure na prepared na prepared na po tayo,” he said.
(What we’ll do is that by the end of January we’ll be well prepared.)

MANILA — The COVID-19 vaccine of Pfizer can still be deployed to other areas in the Philippines depending on the ultra cold storage options that will be offered by the private sector, the health department said Monday.
“Initially, we have these facilities na sabi natin kaya natin sa Metro Manila, Cebu, sa Davao, Region 3, Region 4A. But as time will go by, maraming partners na nag-o-offer sa atin ng ganitong facilities and equipment. So we will see,"" Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual briefing.

Dr. Eva Maria Cutiongco-de la Paz, executive director of the National Institutes of Health in the University of the Philippines, said there will have to be different protocols in the handling of different vaccines.
This is especially true for Pfizer and Moderna, which also has an mRNA vaccine requiring -20 degrees Celsius storage. Both vaccines can be thawed and kept in regular refrigerator temperature, but Pfizer’s vaccine has to be administered within 5 days while Moderna’s can be kept there for 30 days.
De la Paz said it is important to note that vaccine distribution can take an average of 4 to 6 months, from the factory to the country of destination.
The vaccine cold chain involves a global network of cold rooms, freezers, refrigerators, cold boxes and carriers to “keep vaccines at just the right temperature during each"" stage.
She said other vaccines have also been kept in ultra low freezers before, such as the Ebola vaccine, which requires -70 degrees Celsius storage temperature.
De la Paz said the country faces a couple of challenges when it comes to the cold chain. The country will need uninterrupted electrical supply, storage space, ultra cold freezers and dry ice. She said there are generators in place in case of power interruptions.
“We will be needing more storage capacity for NCR if we are talking about the COVID-19 vaccine,” she said based on a previous survey they did among local government units.She said there are still other vaccines that need to be kept in the existing storage units and cannot be displaced by the COVID-19 vaccines.

“We will comply with the President’s directive to postpone face-to-face classes until a vaccine is available,” Briones said in a statement.
Briones was reacting to pronouncements made by President Rodrigo Duterte in a taped address, which aired Friday morning, where the chief executive suggested that there should be no classes until a vaccine against the respiratory illness was developed.
Duterte, in the same taped address, also expressed doubts whether the country was ready for distance learning, but said he would support the Department of Education.
“Indeed, it is a challenging task for us at the Department of Education to prepare our schools in a different set-up but we are committed to our duty to make education available and thriving, even in the most difficult time,” Briones said.
But at the Palace briefing on Monday, Briones said she would ask permission from Duterte to allow face-to-face classes in areas where there are no COVID-19 cases.
Schools that will be allowed to hold in-person classes must follow minimum health standards, such as reduced class sizes, she said.

Learners may enroll in public schools for the entire month of June. The DepEd has ordered that registration during the first 2 weeks should be done through remote methods, such as text messaging or social media.
Month-long remote enrollment in public schools starts
The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT), meanwhile, said the high turnout in NCR and Calabarzon showed that the regions had better access to remote enrollment.
“The enrolment data DepEd brags about reveals an alarming reality—constituents in poorer and more remote rural areas have little to no access to remote modalities,” ACT Secretary General Raymond Basilio said in a statement.
The lack of “remote modalities” in remote rural areas indicated that “millions of poor children in provinces will likely be left behind if classes will officially resume through distance learning,” Basilio added.

In the report released by the DOH Epidemiology Bureau dated Mar. 20, the number of measles cases recorded from Jan. 1 to Mar. 19 has reached 22,967.
From March 13 to 14 alone, the DOH recorded and validated 1,088 measles cases.
A total of 333 patients have died of measles. Majority of the deaths were recorded in Region 4-A with 96, followed by the National Capital Region with 87 deaths.
Region 4-A also had the most number of measles cases with 4,740, followed by NCR with 4,512 cases.
During the same period in 2018, DOH has recorded 4,818 measles cases with 43 deaths.
The government declared a measles outbreak early February after hundreds of children contracted the airborne disease in Metro Manila and parts of Central Luzon and Central Visayas.
Measles outbreak declared in 3 more regions
The measles outbreak may wane in April as the DOH moves to vaccinate some 12 million Filipinos against the disease, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said.
Measles outbreak may dwindle in April - health chief
When a community has low immunization coverage, the likelihood of measles outbreak increases. An immunization coverage of 95% amongst all children is needed for a community to be fully protected against measles. This includes protection for the vulnerable members of the population such as infants that are too young to receive vaccination, people who have weakened immune systems, and older adults.
The Philippines has seen a decline in the first dose of measles vaccine in the past decade – from above 80% in 2008 to below 70% in 2017. Initial figures for 2018 indicate further decrease. As a result, many children have become susceptible to measles infection. WHO estimates that 2.6 million children under the age of 5 years in the Philippines are not protected from measles. As long as routine immunization remains low in the Philippines, the country will experience periodic measles outbreaks.
There are multiple factors that may contribute to the low immunization coverage in the Philippines. Inadequate service delivery continues to be a concern, including less than optimal number of immunization sessions at the primary care level and accessibility issues especially in hard-to-reach areas in the Philippines.

Ubial said that based on epidemiology experts' analysis, adverse effects following immunization are still within acceptable limits.
Many have questioned why the vaccine was purchased in haste.
Ubial, who raised the red flag against the vaccine during the hearing, said the procurement did not go through the standard practices.She said that before a new vaccine is implemented in the immunization program, it needs to undergo health technology assessment done by the National Immunization Committee. It is also the committee, and not the health secretary, who recommends what vaccines the DOH should implement.
The vaccine procurement is now the subject of a congressional inquiry.""I leave it up to the members of the committee investigating this particular case to make the conclusion. Kami po ay nagbigay lang ng datos sa kanila,"" she said.

The government earlier said it can inoculate 50 to 70 million Filipinos against COVID-19 by the end of the year if vaccine supplies arrive on time.
However, the top official in charge of rolling out COVID-19 vaccines said procurement of the medicines was delayed over manufacturers’ concerns that the Philippines may sue them, just like it did with Sanofi over the Dengvaxia vaccines.
Several new and more infectious variants of the novel coronavirus have emerged. One variant, which was first reported in the United Kingdom, has spread to the Philippines.
The UK coronavirus variant: what we know
Eighteen new cases of the UK variant were confirmed earlier on Sunday, bringing the county's total to 62.The DOH has also confirmed two mutations of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, in Central Visayas.
Another variant from South Africa, has drawn concern from scientists as vaccines seem to be less effective against it.The country’s first COVID-19 case was a 38-year-old Chinese woman from Wuhan, China, which was confirmed by the DOH on Jan. 30, last year.
The pandemic has already caused the Philippines to plunge into its worst economic contraction since World War 2.
Worldwide, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 111 million people and caused over 2.46 million deaths since it first emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center.
The United States remains the most badly affected country with over 28 million infections and over 497,000 deaths.

Robredo said she supports the standardization of travel requirements, but expressed concern for local government units (LGUs) that are trying to contain virus transmission.
""Para sa'kin, delikado yun, lalo pa ngayon na mataas ang cases natin... Baka maging dahilan ulit ng surge,"" she said of the latest Inter-Agency Task Force ruling on her weekly radio show.

The Philippines on Saturday recorded its highest daily rise of newly-confirmed COVID-19 cases in over 4 months, with 2,921 new infections raising the country's total to 574,247.PH records 2,921 new COVID-19 cases, highest in over 4 months
The IATF against COVID-19 should have representatives from local governments, according to the Vice President.
""Sana, pinag-aaralan nang maayos. Yung pinakasusi sa pagbubukas ng economy, ‘yung bakuna, yun ng tutukan natin,"" she added.
(This should be studied well. The key to reopening the economy is the vaccine, we should focus on that.)
The Philippines later Sunday received its first official supply of COVID-19 vaccines, courtesy of China's Sinovac Biotech.
A Chinese military plane carrying the first batch of CoronaVac vaccines landed in Villamor Air Base at around 4 in the afternoon Sunday.

The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to Sinovac's product for public use. But it did not recommend it for health workers exposed to COVID-19 after a Brazil study found it was only 50 percent effective for the said group.
The government's interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and the health department's Technical Advisory Group (TAG), however, deemed it ""sufficient to recommend the use of the vaccine for healthcare workers.""

Education Secretary Leonor Briones said they have to consider the rights of the students, as much as there is a need to intensify immunization.
Instead, DepEd is looking into other ways to convince parents to have their children vaccinated.
Among these are developing consent and evaluation forms, verifying health records, and coordinating with health centers.
""Learners, parents, teaching and non-academic personnel, and stakeholders may rest assured that the department is working closely with DOH in monitoring measles cases and in strengthening efforts to combat the disease,"" Briones said in a statement.

Records from DOH showed that some 11,459 have contracted measles while 189 have died because of the disease from Jan. 1 to Feb. 20 this year.
The National Capital Region (NCR) recorded the highest number of cases with 2,936 and 52 deaths followed by Calabarzon with 2,635 cases and 61 deaths. Most of the fatalities had no immunization for measles.

MANILA - The Philippines can inoculate 50 to 70 million of its citizens against COVID-19 by the end of the year if vaccine supplies arrive on time, an official leading the country's immunization drive said Sunday.
The country will get some 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the global alliance COVAX Facility in the first quarter, including 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine expected to arrive by the third week of February, said vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.
Government aims to vaccinate some 70 to 80 million Filipino adults to achieve herd immunity, he said.
""Sa best case scenario po, kung meron po tayong enough supply at naging successful ang negotiation natin, by December, kaya po natin 50 to 70 million,"" Galvez told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.
""Kung magkakaroon po tayo ng shortage ng supply, worst case scenario po natin, middle of 2022 po,"" he added.

The country has so far signed term sheets with 5 drugmakers amounting to some 108 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine, Galvez said. This is on top of the 44 million that the World Health Organization said it would give under the COVAX Facility, he added.
""More or less 152 million doses na po tayo. Kung titingnan po natin, ididivide po natin sa dalawa, meron na po tayong more than 75 million na mababakunahan,"" he said.
(More or less we have 152 million doses. If we divide it to two, we can vaccinate more than 75 million people.)
Health workers in COVID-19 referral hospitals that first responded to the pandemic will be prioritized, according to Galvez.

The 2,099 additional cases reported on Monday is the second highest in a day since the COVID-19 outbreak reached the Philippines in January. The highest number of additional cases — at 2,434 — was reported on Sunday.
Of Monday’s additional cases, 841 were “late cases”, or those whose test results were released four days ago or earlier. ""Fresh cases"" are those whose results were released within the last 3 days.
Of the fresh cases, 601 are from the National Capital Region, 280 are from Region 7 (Central Visayas), 48 are Filipino repatriates, and 329 were tagged as “Others.” Others may refer to cases from other regions or those without location data.
Of the late cases, 397 are from NCR, 186 from Central Visayas, 212 are tagged as Others, and 46 are Filipino repatriates.
“Nakakakita po tayo ng pagtaas ng bilang ng mga kaso nitong nakaraang araw,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire acknowledged during a televised briefing.

“Cases in Visayas region are seen to be slowly decreasing, but we must continue to monitor the area if the decrease will be sustained,” she said.
Vergeire noted the clustering of cases in Cebu and the NCR, saying, “There were also reported clustering in workplaces such as the MRT.”
Media reports said there are more than 180 cases among MRT personnel, although DOH data only counted 127.
Vergeire said a private company had 39 cases in the last two weeks.
Meanwhile, the DOH reported 243 new recovered patients, bringing the total recoveries to 12,185.
Six new COVID-related deaths were also recorded, raising the death toll to 1,303.
According to the DOH, 5 of the 6 new fatalities occurred in June.
It also disclosed that 20 cases were removed from the total count because these were considered duplicates of already logged cases.
The DOH has attributed the increase in cases to the easing of community quarantines in various parts of the country, including Metro Manila, which shifted to a more relaxed general community quarantine since June 1.
In an advisory sent to media after the briefing, the DOH noted “a significant decline” in cases for the following cities: Marikina decreased by 68%, Muntinlupa decreased by 10%, Makati decreased by 4%. However, it is also monitoring Quezon City “which has shown an increase by 34%.”
Despite the increase in total cases, Vergeire said the case doubling time of the country was still relatively good at 7.95 days. This is the amount of time before the number of COVID-19 cases double. Cebu City also has a case doubling time of 7.95 while NCR is at 8.39.
At the same time, Vergeire said the increase in cases in the last week is also partly because of the “ongoing verification process” of the DOH’s accredited laboratories. Addressing delays in validation and testing have in the past caused an increase in reported cases.
Vergeire said Filipinos can help curb the spread of the disease by observing proper hygiene and physical distancing. ",abscbn

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News
MANILA - A former health secretary on Wednesday expressed concern on the high levels of hesitancy towards getting COVID-19 shots in Metro Manila, saying this could affect the country's efforts to stem the pandemic.
""I think that the data is very alarming. This 75 percent vaccine hesitancy is way dangerous... and we need to do something about it,"" Dr. Esperanza Cabral told ANC.
Citing previous data, vaccine hesitancy in the country only ranged between 40 to 60 percent, she said.
If three-quarters of the population in the Philippine capital are wary of the inoculation, this is a ""big, dangerous leap,"" Cabral added.
Only 1 in 4 Metro Manila residents willing to take COVID-19 vaccine — OCTA survey
In a non-commissioned scientific poll conducted by a group of experts in December, only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
Some 47 percent of respondents were undecided while 28 percent said they would not get the coronavirus vaccine, the OCTA Research Team survey revealed.
To address this seeming widespread hesitancy, Cabral said health authorities should conduct massive information campaign.
""We need to make them understand that vaccines are effective and safe. And that if they take it, the chances of developing this dreaded coronavirus illness are going to be reduced by very significant number,"" she said.
""We need to make sure that we reach everybody with the correct information so that they can choose for themselves whether they will accept the vaccine or not.""
As parts of the world began rolling out COVID-19 vaccines, with priority given to health-care workers, Cabral urged the Philippine government to focus on the execution of the planned nationwide COVID-19 vaccination.
""As far as the roadmap is concerned, I think that the roadmap is basically good. It follows the roadmap of many other countries and the recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO),"" she said.
""It is just the execution of the roadmap that we need to look into. We're always being praised for having nice implementation programs and plans but when it comes to the execution, that is sometimes where we fail.""
A year into the pandemic, the Philippines has logged nearly 480,000 coronavirus infections, of which 9,300 have died from the illness, among the highest in the Southeast Asian region.

MAYNILA - Umarangkada na ang COVID-19 vaccine rollout ng iba pang lungsod sa Metro Manila kasabay ng pagdating ng Sinovac vaccines mula China.Ito ay ilang araw matapos dumating ang nasa 600,000 doses ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 mula sa Sinovac ng bansang China na donasyon ng kanilang pamahalaan.Nagsimula na ang COVID-19 vaccination program ng lokal na pamahalaan ng Maynila sa Sta. Ana Hospital, kung saan 200 health workers ang inaasahang magpapabakuna.Unang naturukan si Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna na isang doktor. Naturukan din ang pinuno ng City Health Office at Sta. Ana Hospital.Aabot naman sa 153 ang target bakunahan sa Pasig City General Hospital at Pasig City Children’s Hospital sa pag-arangkada ng vaccination program sa lungsod.
Si Dr. Nerissa Sabarre, head ng COVID-19 referral facility ng Pasig City Children’s Hospital, ang unang nabakunahan sa “symbolic” na vaccination ceremony ng lungsod.Wala namang naramdamang adverse effects ang mga nabakunahan sa ngayon.“Okay, I didn't feel anything, halos wala akong naramdaman. I feel very good, I feel well,” ayon kay Dr. Noel Cruz, doktor sa Pasig City General Hospital.Nagpasalamat naman si Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto sa health care workers sa kanilang sakripisyo ngayong COVID-19 pandemic.""Iyong pagsuot ng PPE sa emergency room nang 7 to 8 hours lahat po 'yan, kayo po ang nakaranas niyan. Hindi naman kami, kaming politiko 'pag gusto naming umupo, puwede kaming umupo. Pagod din naman kami pero nakakapagpahinga kami hindi gaya ng health care professionals natin na talagang minsan walang pahinga,"" ani Sotto.Sa Pasay City General Hospital naman, tinatayang nasa 100 health care workers ang matuturukan ng Sinovac vaccines. Aabot sa 300 doses ng bakuna mula sa Department of Health storage facility sa Marikina ang dumating sa ospital gabi ng Lunes.
Pero kasabay nito, may ilan umanong mga medical frontliner ang umatras sa pagpapabakuna dahil sa napapaulat na mababang efficacy rate nito.Ayon kay Imelda Mateo, chief ng Amang Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center sa Marikina, kaunti lang mula sa mga nag-pre-register na frontliner sa pagpapabakuna ang sumipot sa pagsisimula ng kanilang inoculation drive sa mega vaccination center ng lungsod ngayong Martes.Aniya, 120 lang ang sumipot mula sa 1,200 na pumirma at nagbigay ng consent na mabakunahan sila noong panahon na ang inaasahang bakuna ay Pfizer o AstraZeneca mula sa COVAX facility ng World Health Organization.
Pero noong malaman na Sinovac ang unang ibibigay ay nagsiatrasan umano ang karamihan. Aniya, hindi naman daw sila nagkulang sa pagbibigay ng impormasyon tungkol sa bakuna.
""It’s equivalent to the other brands so 'yun ang motive natin. Ma-prevent at ma-down 'yung chance na ma-confine, 'yung probability of severe incubation, sometimes death,"" ani Mateo.Ayon kay Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire, aabot sa 749 health workers na ang nabakunahan mula nang magsimula ang vaccine rollout noong Lunes. Aniya, inaasahan nila na dadami pa ang frontliner na magpapabakuna sa mga darating na araw.
""Hindi masasabi na 100 percent na walang agam-agam. Makikita natin sa darating na araw. Titingnan natin in the coming days,"" ani Vergeire.
Nabanggit naman ng gobyerno na mananatili pa ring prayoridad ang mga frontliner kahit pa man hindi nila piliin na magpaturok ng Sinovac vaccines.Noong Lunes, Marso 1, nagsimula sa vaccine rollout ang Pilipinas, na nahuhuli na kung ikukumpara sa mga karatig-lugar sa Southeast Asia pagdating sa pagpapabakuna kontra COVID-19. Target ng gobyerno na mabakunahan ang nasa 70 milyong katao sa populasyon ng bansa.
Bukod sa 600,000 doses ng Sinovac na donasyon ng China sa Pilipinas, inaasahan ang pagdating ng Astrazeneca at Pfizer vaccines na mula sa COVAX facility ng World Health Organization. Naantala ito dahil sa hinihinging indemnification deal, kung saan gobyerno ang sasagot ng gastusin kung sakaling may mga makaranas ng side effects dahil sa turok.-- Mga ulat nina Adrian Ayalin, Jeck Batallones, at Arra Perez, ABS-CBN News",abscbn

MANILA — Only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, according a study by the OCTA Group.
The remaining 75 percent of respondents are mostly undecided (47 percent) or unwilling to be vaccinated (28 percent).
Table from OCTA Research Group
“We were also surprised that despite being the most informed region where discussion about this has taken place that a lot of people are still not sure or not willing to have themselves vaccinated. This is a product of a lack of information,” Prof. Ranjit Rye of OCTA Group told ABS-CBN News.
The non-commissioned scientific poll, which surveyed 600 people from Metro Manila aged 18 and above from December 9 to 13, 2020, has a sampling error of ±4%.

The respondents were asked about their readiness to be vaccinated “if a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19 is already available.”
Among socio-economic classes, those in classes ABC were more willing to be vaccinated. Meanwhile, a third of those unwilling to be vaccinated were from class E. More than half of class ABC are also undecided or “can’t say” if they will have themselves vaccinated.
Mathematics professor Dr. Guido David said it might be because classes ABC have more information about vaccines in general.
“They are more updated and more confident. For socioeconomic classes DE, uncertainty is higher because they don’t have access to as much information,” he said in Filipino.
David said there is still a chance for the 47% undecided to be convinced of the merits of vaccination.
“I think the public needs to see more credible proof that it is safe and effective,” he said. “They want to see for themselves. They want to see the results of those who were vaccinated in other countries.”
Government should launch an information drive on vaccines to increase the public's confidence, David told ABS-CBN's Teleradyo Wednesday.
""Importante d'yan 'yung public trust sa government kaya importante na 'yung government natin maka-secure ng vaccine that is safe and mataas ang confidence ng mga tao dito sa vaccine para ma-maintain ang public trust sa government,"" he added.
(Public trust in government is also important so the latter must secure a vaccine that is safe and has a high confidence from the public.)
The survey did not include questions on why respondents would like or would not like to be vaccinated.
Both David and Rye said the Dengvaxia issue a few years back had affected the confidence of Filipinos on vaccines but trust can be regained through an information drive.
Rye said local government units should also consider conducting surveys of their constituents.
“That’s a big chunk of a population in the NCR uncertain about getting vaccinated in the first place. That uncertainty has to be dealt with because we are already deploying resources,” he said, referring to LGUs allotting funds for COVID-19 vaccine procurement.
The OCTA group, which has regularly released projections of COVID-19 case numbers, is composed of professors from the University of the Philippines, the University of Santo Tomas, and Providence College in the United States.

Dr. Maricar Limpin of the Health Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 said it’s actually a “good sign” that people want to learn more about the vaccines first before taking them.“Yung 28% probably pwede pa natin ma-convince 'yan (The 28% who say they do not want the vaccine can still be convinced),” she said.
Limpin appealed to the public to participate in the vaccination program since it is also for their own protection against COVID-19.
Meanwhile, public health expert and former government adviser Dr. Tony Leachon said having a large number of people vaccinated is crucial to reach herd immunity or when most of the population is immune from a disease.
“If you would be able to distribute, procure (vaccines), execute the plan well ma-increase yung acceptability rate from 25 to about 70%. That would be the herd immunity for the National Capital Region. And you can reopen the economy and bring back the normalcy,” he siad.
(If you would be able to distribute, procure (vaccines), execute the plan well you can increse the acceptability rate from 35 to about 70%. That would be the herd immunity for the National Capital Region. And you can reopen the economy and bring back the normalcy.)
He expects the perception of people to improve with the appointment of Secretary Carlito Galvez as vaccine czar.
He also said that Filipinos might have different perceptions depending on the vaccine that the country will procure. He said there seems to be different perceptions towards the vaccines produced in the West or the United States and Europe as opposed to those coming from China.
From the same Tugon ng Masa survey of the OCTA Group, majority (81%) of respondents said they approved of the national government’s COVID-19 response.
“This significant approval of the National Government’s Covid-19 response is shared across different socioeconomic classes in Metro Manila (ABC at 70 percent, D at 83 percent and E at 82 percent),” the OCTA Group said in a statement.
The group noted that a minority of 6 percent of Metro Manila respondents were dissatisfied with the government response. Most of them are from the class ABC.

Domagoso said the Manila city government and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been conducting raids in search of reported illegal vaccination hubs in the city.
The FDA has yet to authorize the use of any COVID-19 vaccine in the country.
Asked to comment on the recent issue of several Presidential Security Group (PSG) members getting inoculated against COVID-19, Domagoso said: “Basta ang masasabi ko lang sa iyo, we in the City of Manila, we are certain about our rules.”

(For those who have colonial mentality who want Pfizer, you can wait, but this is our warning: it can only be distributed to major cities because we really don't have cold chain capacity outside Metro Manila.)
Authorities, he said, recently secured 30 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine Covovax from Serum Institute of India (SII), which only needs to be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.SII partnered with U.S.-based Novavax Inc for the development and commercialization of Covovax, which is in third-stage trials and expected to be approved for use by international regulators, Faberco said.
The vaccine will be available locally by the third quarter of 2021 and will be used to inoculate 15 million vulnerable and poor Filipinos, it said.
Galvez has said the Philippines was negotiating with seven vaccine manufacturers to procure at least 148 million COVID-19 shots as it seeks to inoculate close to two-thirds of its population this year, said Carlito Galvez, a former military general in charge of the Philippines' strategy to fight the coronavirus.Manila is hoping to close similar deals with Moderna , AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson , Sinovac Biotech and the Gamaleya Institute this month.
There are now three applicants for emergency use authorization of their vaccines in the Philippines - Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Russia's Gamaleya.

MANILA - ""A lot"" of mothers are refusing to vaccinate their children, a health official warned Tuesday, with about 11 percent of moms in Manila refusing to participate in an immunization campaign against polio last month.
Health Assistant Secretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said most of the mothers who refused to vaccinate their children come from the ""poor sector of the society.""
""It has been reported ever since 2016 that a lot of mothers are already refusing vaccination. We don’t know why, we have asked some, of course there would be this controversy, others would be not believing these vaccines,"" she told ANC's Early Edition.
Last month, the Department of Health announced that the country has recorded its first cases of polio after 19 years of being declared polio-free due to plummeting immunization coverage. A student in Manila had also died of diphtheria, while government earlier declared a national dengue epidemic and measles outbreak.
Chickenpox, mumps, pertussis: Doctor warns of more disease outbreaks as vaccine rates plummet
Vergeire said the agency conducted an immunization campaign against polio last month in the nation's capital, where ""about 11 percent"" of the mothers refused the vaccine.
""The mothers were saying they don’t need it. The mothers were saying the child already had the vaccination before. These kinds of reasons have been given to us when we went to the city of Manila,"" she said.
Vergeire, however, said children up to 5 years old must be given the vaccine.
""We are going to provide immunization irrespective of their immunization status. It has no side effects, no bad taste for this oral polio vaccine. It is safe and has been used ever since the 1970s,"" she said.
Vergeire, meantime, said dengue cases are ""becoming manageable.""
""We are comparing it with the epidemic and alert thresholds that we have and we can see cases are really going down,"" she said.
There was also a rise in vaccination against measles, following the DOH's campaign against the illness due to the outbreak, she added.",abscbn

MANILA - Manila is mulling using churches as sites to provide COVID-19 jabs, its mayor said Friday, in hopes of a rapid rollout of vaccines.
""Malaking bagay rin ang simbahan dahil may bubong na maayos. Maganda ang arrangement. This might be considered,"" mayor Isko Moreno told Teleradyo.
(Churches could be used because they have good roofs and arrangement.)
Moreno is set to meet with Manila Apostolic Administrator Bishop Broderick Pabillo to discuss the proposal.

Pabillo, in separate interview with Teleradyo, said they were willing to allow the city government to use their facilities as COVID-19 vaccination sites.
""Siguro kailangan nila malalaking simbahan so maghahanap kami. Kung ano 'yong mga kinakailangan nilang facilities at kung saang area,” he said.
(Maybe they will need a large church so we will look for one. What facilities they will use and which area.)
Pabillo said Manila churches had other facilities such as gyms and halls. Church staff members can also help secure the vaccination sites, he added.
Moreno said they aim to inoculate a maximum of 1,000 residents from 18 vaccination sites they had already identified.Medical frontliners, older people and teachers are among those who will be prioritized, he added.
The city mayor bared that some 76,000 residents had already pre-registered for the vaccine program. They would receive the anti-coronavirus jabs after the priority sector.Manila City has secured 800,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine from British pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca, which will be enough to inoculate 400,000 people.
To increase vaccine confidence, Moreno said he would fulfill his promise of getting the COVID-19 shots in public.
""Sabi ko nga, para lang mabawasan 'yong pangamba ng utaw, eh papaturok ako sa bagay na ipapaturok ko sa kanila,"" he said.

MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte will get COVID-19 shots in public to boost Filipinos' vaccine confidence, Malacañang said on Monday, contrary to earlier pronouncements.“I think the President has said he will now have himself vaccinated publicly. He only has to announce when it will be done,” Palace spokesman Harry Roque told a news briefing.
“That’s, of course, in recognition of the fact na naghihintay ng senyales ang taong bayan kung talaga sila’y magpapabakuna o hindi.

Nearly half or 47 percent of Filipinos said late last year they would not get themselves vaccinated against COVID-19, according to a Pulse Asia survey.A separate OCTA research group poll found that only a fourth of Metro Manila residents were willing get the anti-coronavirus shots. But the interior department placed this figure lower, saying only 3 in 10 Metro Manila residents wanted to get the jabs.

How Filipino travelers can get polio vaccine certificate,"Jaehwa Bernardo, ABS-CBN News",Nov 19 2019 07:50 PM,"Travelers who need an International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) against polio may acquire the document at the offices of the Bureau of Quarantine.
MANILA – When the news broke that several countries are now requiring Filipino travelers for proof of polio vaccination, seaman Orbin Jo Uayan was advised by his recruitment agency to acquire an International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV) against polio.
Uayan, 24, was among scores of people who lined up for hours on Tuesday morning at the Bureau of Quarantine (BOQ) office in the Port Area of Manila, where he was administered a dose of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and issued an ICV.
Like Uayan, Julieta Formento also went to the BOQ office for an ICV, which she will use for an upcoming travel around Asian countries.
Formento, 56, said he had not checked whether the countries she will be visiting required an ICV but opted to secure the certificate in case it will be asked from her.
At least 19 countries are now requiring Filipino travelers for an ICV, based on a list from the World Health Organization (WHO) shown to ABS-CBN News by the BOQ.
More countries require PH travelers to get polio vaccine certificate
HOW TO GET AN ICV
Michael Sherwin Evangelista, a medical officer at the BOQ, said ICVs are only issued at the BOQ office in Manila and the bureau’s regional offices, such as in Cebu, Cagayan de Oro, and Zamboanga City, among others.
“As for now, dito lang po sa [you can get certificates only at our] Quarantine stations,” he said in an interview.
A sample International Certificate of Vaccination.
Travelers may get vaccinated and acquire an ICV during the bureau’s office hours from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Evangelista advised travelers to contact their destination’s embassy or consulate in the Philippines to inquire about immunization requirements, while overseas Filipino workers were told to coordinate with their agencies.
A traveler may get vaccinated at the BOQ office or through a private doctor, Evangelista explained.
If a traveler opts to get vaccinated through a private doctor, they will be issued a certificate as proof of vaccination which the BOQ will “convert” into an ICV.
The certificate, according to Evangelista, needs to include the names of the patient and doctor that administered the vaccine, and the brand name and lot number of the vaccine.
A medical personnel from the Bureau of Quarantine prepares an injectible Inactivated polio vaccine.
Travelers who plan to get vaccinated at the BOQ compound in Manila – which has 5 vaccination sites – are first required to fill out a form about their medical history.
“[The form is] designed to explore your medical history, any allergies or any contraindication sa polio vaccine naming [to our polio vaccine],” Evangelista said.
After filling out the form, travelers will be screened by doctors.
Once screened, the travelers will be administered IPV, an injectable vaccine, followed by an observation period of around 5 to 15 minutes in case of any allergic reactions, according to Evangelista.
After vaccination, the traveler will pay P300 for the ICV, which has a lifetime validity.
The entire process takes about 2 to 3 hours, according to Evangelista, but people applying for the certificates told ABS-CBN News that the process took them up to 5 hours.
“It’s just the volume that we are dealing with ngayon, kasi dumami bigla,” said Evangelista.
People line up outside one of the polio vaccination site inside the Bureau of Quarantine's compound in Manila.
Priority is given to pregnant women, senior citizens, persons with disability, and travelers whose flights are on the same day.
The number of polio vaccinations at the BOQ increased to over 2,000 per day from 200 per day in just 2 weeks, BOQ records showed.On Monday, Nov. 18, the BOQ administered IPV to 2,095 persons, based on records.
Evangelista appealed to the public “to be patient and be considerate of the long lines” that they may have to endure.

Simeon Celji Jr., Presidential Photo/File
MANILA (UPDATE) - Experimental COVID-19 vaccines used by President Rodrigo Duterte's security group were smuggled, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said Wednesday, as authorities are investigating how it got past border inspection.
""Yes, it’s smuggled. Kasi hindi authorized na pumasok dito (Because it was not authorized to enter here). Only the government can authorize that through the FDA (Food and Drug Administration),” he told reporters during the Rizal Day celebrations in Manila.
While the use of vaccines was unauthorized, Lorenzana believed the early inoculation of members of Presidential Security Group (PSG) was ""justified"".
""Explain lang talaga ng PSG kung bakit nila ginawa 'yon. Justified naman eh. Anyway 'yong vaccine naman ay hindi fake. Totoo naman,"" he said.
(The PSG should explain why they did it. It's still justified. Anyway, the vaccine was not fake. It's real.)
The defense chief is not aware who donated the vaccines, which were reportedly developed by Chinese drug maker Sinopharm.
Lorenza revealed he had received rumors before of such vaccination but didn't inquire further.
""Basta alam namin noon, ang rumors na kumakalat ay nagpabakuna na 'yong PSG. Who authorized it, hindi naman kami nagtanong,"" he said.
(There were rumors before that members of PSG had been vaccinated. We didn't ask who authorized it.)
""Ngayon pa lang lumalabas 'yong facts na 'yan ay hindi pa pala authorized na vaccine sa Pilipinas,"" he added.
(It was only revealed now that the vaccine is not authorized for use in the Philippines.)
Although he administratively oversees the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), he cannot impose sanctions to PSG because it is a detached unit from the military force.
Moving forward, Lorenzana said he would no longer allow the military to accept unauthorized vaccines from here on.
""Mga sundalo natin? Huwag muna. Kailangan sundin natin 'yong procedure. Kaya nga tinatag natin 'yong FDA eh para meron tayong procedure diyan,"" he said.
(Our soldiers [getting vaccinations]? Not for now. We should follow the procedure. That's why there's an FDA because we have procedures to follow.)
For his part, PSG chief Jesus Durante said the vaccinations began in September and the last batch was in October.
""It started actually September and the last batch October...All of the personnel inoculated so far are doing good. No side effects whatsoever,"" he said in an ANC interview.He also said the President was not informed about the inoculations until after the PSG men were vaccinated.""We didn’t ask permission. We just informed him about it after all the close-in personnel were vaccinated. He was surprised,"" he added.Presidential Security Group got coronavirus vaccines in September, says chief
In light of the incident, the Bureau of Customs (BOC) is investigating the possible smuggling of the vaccines.
""Based on our records, wala pong nag-declare sa amin ng vaccines (no one has declared vaccines),"" BOC assistant commissioner and spokesperson Vincent Philip Maronilla told Teleradyo.
The Customs official suspect the vaccines passed through the airport because it requires cold storage.
Even if the vaccines were donated as earlier claimed by Malacañang, Maronilla said it would still require approval from regulatory agencies.
""'Pag donated po kasi and it's still, let say for example vaccine, this will still have to go through some licensing, some sort of permit coming from the FDA before it can be released. At least kung walang permit, we usually allow the FDA to tell us if it’s okay for products to be released,"" he said.
It was President Rodrigo Duterte who revealed in his public address on Saturday that some soldiers had already been vaccinated against COVID-19.
Military officials confirmed the move to the dismay of health-care workers, who should be the first to get inoculated against the raging virus.
Palace: COVID-19 vaccine given to PSG was 'a donation'
The Palace had said the vaccines used by PSG were donated and maintained it found nothing illegal in the inoculation, saying it was meant to protect the President from risk of COVID-19 infection.Unauthorized use of COVID-19 vaccine illegal, FDA says after Duterte's PSG inoculated
However, the FDA maintained that unauthorized use of COVID-19 vaccine is illegal.
“As of date, the FDA has not issued any emergency use authorization (EUA) to any vaccine for COVID-19. Without the proper authorization, there is no guarantee on the safety, quality and efficacy of said vaccine as the same has not undergone the required technical evaluation by the FDA,"" FDA director general Eric Domingo had said.
The agency said ""manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertisement, or sponsorship of any unauthorized vaccine"" remain prohibited.

MANILA - Filipinos primarily consider the safety of a COVID-19 vaccine when deciding whether to be inoculated, a Radio Veritas survey released Wednesday showed.
Of 1,200 respondents, the primary concern of 67 percent was safety, followed by efficacy (17 percent), country of manufacture (8 percent), testimony of early users (6 percent), and purpose of use (2 percent).
Cost was not included as the respondents assumed the vaccine will be given for free, according to the survey.
Government's vaccination effort must prioritize those who are in need, said Radio Veritas president Rev. Fr. Anton CT Pascual.
""Vaccines must not be allocated first to those who are wealthy, powerful, and influential for such would be a great moral and social tragedy,"" he said.
Government must also improve trust on the vaccine and minimize issues and controversies, according to the survey's head, sociologist Bro. Clifford Sorita.
""To build trust and confidence in our vaccination efforts, government should provide the public with easily understandable scientifically based information and ensure everyone’s concerns are addressed very early and often,"" he said.
The survey, conducted Jan. 4 to 22, has ±3 margin of error, Radio Veritas said.
A Pulse Asia survey earlier found that nearly half of Filipinos would skip vaccination against COVID-19. Only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents are willing to get inoculated against the deadly respiratory illness, according to another survey by OCTA Research Group.

In a webinar officiated by Liveable Cities Challenge PH and Globe Telecom, Bacolod City Mayor Bing Leonardia said a COVID-19 vaccination council was created in December last year by the city government, among the first LGUs to create such body.
Leonardia said that out of Bacolod’s population of 624,987, the city government aims to vaccinate 424,992 or 68%. Their budget for the program is P300 million.Some 650,000 sure doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine can cover 325,000 individuals or 76% of the target population. The rest will have to wait for another batch of vaccine allocation.
“The down payment was done last Monday that came about after Malacañang allowed us to make that down payment,” Leonardia said.He said the city is heavily dependent on private-public partnership as volunteers would complement the needed vaccination manpower.They aim to vaccinate 13,500 residents per day in the 27 vaccination centers, or up to 20,000 per day if 40 centers are mobilized.“We have established direction towards this,"" he said.
Barangay registration, as well as a vaccine education program, are ongoing in the city.Bacolod City's cold chain facility is also in place, Leonardia said — a 30 sqm cold room, 1 unit of ultra cold storage good for 80,000 doses and portable vaccine storage of 25 units that would be good for 1.6 million doses.“Last February 11, we delivered our vaccination plan. And yesterday (February 23), we were informed by DOH that our vaccination plan is okay. We are set to go ahead with our vaccination plan,” according to the mayor.
Leonardia said they are active in their campaign against COVID-19 despite registering 0 new cases recently.Losing 190 people to the virus, however, was not something to be taken lightly, according to the mayor.

QUEZON CITY
In Quezon City, “QC Protektado sa Bakunang Sigurado” is in place, with pre-vaccination phase starting as early as December 3, said Mayor Joy Belmonte.
There are 1,066,000 priority individuals in the city, including frontline workers in health facilities, senior citizens, persons with comorbidities, other essential workers and the indigent population.Both Quezon City and Makati City have ID systems in place that were previously created to monitor the delivery of services to residents during the pandemic. This would now be used to create a master list of individuals to be vaccinated.“Anyone who lives in Quezon City, regardless if they are voters or not, can avail of the Quezon City ID. You can get a QC resident ID or a non-resident ID. Non-resident ID are for those working for and /or studying because we believe that anyone who contributes to the well-being of the progress and development of our city can and should be vaccinated in our city,” Belmonte said.Quezon City rejects reopening cinemas amid pandemic
Over 1M QC residents in priority list for COVID-19 vaccines: Belmonte
There is an ongoing vaccine confidence campaign as well to encourage more people to receive the shots.
“Since we have started, we have started about 160,000 registries on the master list and we are giving ourselves 6 months, considering the size and scope of the city,” she said.Quezon City partnered with Zuellig Pharma for vaccine handling and rollout.Zuellig will be the one to provide cold storage to Quezon City, but the city will invest on storage when the supplies arrive in vaccination centers.A total of 1.1 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine is being targeted, for a budget of P5 billion, but only more than 500,000 doses have been committed to the city.
“We are still in the process of negotiating with other pharmaceuticals,” Belmonte said.Talks with dioceses are also underway to tap on parishes to serve as additional inoculation areas aside from the already-set 24 sites.
The city has also partnered with hospitals for manpower needs. About 1,200 personnel will be mobilized per an 8 hour shift to conduct vaccinations.
“The Ateneo offered to become our mega-vaccination center,” Belmonte said.
In Quezon City, she pointed out, they have to vaccinate 1.6 million in 6 to 8 months. Some 80% of its residents are above 15 years old, she noted.
For the post-vaccination stage, there will be monitoring of people vaccinated.
QC hotline 122 can be utilized for queries pertaining to the vaccine, and barangay health and other trained workers will monitor and can conduct home visits.
“Every patient will receive a message to tell them when, where, and what time they will be vaccinated... Our goal is to achieve a herd immunity, which is 80% of our population,” Belmonte said.“Most of the people who are undecided or do not want are because they are just afraid, they lack information. That's why our communications plan at present is tailor-fitted to answer the fear of our people,” she added.MAKATI CITYMeanwhile, in Makati City, Mayor Abby Binay said that an initial budget of P1.6 billion has been allotted for its vaccination program, which will also cover business owners and their employees working in the city.
“This program is our way of helping our economic frontliners,” Binay said.The city will have 32 vaccination sites and 104 vaccination teams.
An estimated 500,000 will be vaccinated.Makati firms' employees included in free vaccination program: mayor
“We have converted the Makati coliseum into a mega-vaccination site,” Binay said.There is an online registration for Bakuna Makati. Screening and counseling will be done online.
The Makatizens ID system will be the city’s database in creating the vaccine recipients master list.
The target is to have 11,000 people vaccinated daily, or totally cover the target population in a span of 60-90 days.
“The registration also includes screening, so we can’t launch it too early because some are time-bound, like information of latest vaccine administered, etcetera,” Binay said.“In 2017, we have launched our Makatizens card. So we already have our database plus our voters records. So, we are backtracking for our master list, how many will register,” she added.ORMOC CITYMayor Richard Gomez of Ormoc City said that vaccine access can be challenging in his area of responsibility because while it has a relatively small population, its land area is similar to the size of Metro Manila.
The estimated number of people to be vaccinated in the city is 131,879, out of the city’s more than 240,000 population. They will be divided in 6 districts and would be inoculated through the city's 80 vaccination sites.
Gomez said they would rely on private-public partnership for the vaccination drive, which they target to complete in 14 days.
A private company will handle the logistics for vaccines in Ormoc City.
“Our main storage will be at the Ormoc City Superdome,” Gomez said.
Plans are also in place to convince others who are not yet decided to be vaccinated, as well as for proper disposal of the vaccination waste.
""For the succeeding year, we have set aside budget to make vaccination free since our population is not that big,"" Gomez said.“Since the pandemic started, we have created our QR code system. Anywhere in Ormoc that you go, we supplied about 9,000 plus scanners all over the city. It’s an all-in-one thing. Our COVID registration is here. We are more than 90% done with our registration. We are just waiting for the questionnaires from the Department of Health,” he said.
“Those who were not able to register in our QR code system, their barangay workers wlil go to do house-to-house to get them registered,” he added.Meanwhile, Margaret Bengzon, Senior Health Consultant of the Ayala Healthcare Holdings, Inc. (AC Health), said the private sector is already augmenting the needs of local government units.Bengzon said the benefits of public-private partnership are ""accelerated execution, reduced financial burden, getting more lives saved and leading faster recovery of economic forces.""“The Ayala Group and other private sector partners have been supporting the National Vaccine Deployment Program across various workstreams. IT systems, funding & budget, legal/regulatory & policy, vaccine evaluation,” she said.“AC Health will augment the efforts of our local government hosts. We can deliver as close to an end-to-end vaccination program,” she added.Malacañang said on Thursday that the Philippines would get its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines this weekend, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 doses from Sinovac.
The Philippines, which has Southeast Asia's second highest COVID-19 cases, has lagged behind its regional neighbors in launching its vaccination drive.
The government aims to vaccinate up to 70 million or two-thirds of the population this year.

MGCQ for entire Philippines 'doable' in Feb or March: trade chief
The Philippines has so far recorded 563,456 coronavirus infections, which have stopped the economy from fully reopening.'We are sinking': Duterte says Philippines losing P2 billion daily due to COVID-19
The country has yet to receive any COVID-19 shot, with which it hoped to launch its vaccination drive this month, and cover up to 70 million people or two-thirds of the population through the year.Further delays could derail economic recovery after the country's worst contraction on record last year, when it slumped 9.5 percent, the biggest decline in Southeast Asia.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier in the day said he believes local government units (LGU) have the capacity to deal with the proposed shift to a more lenient MGCQ amid the lingering COVID-19 pandemic.

“Tayo po ay handa naman. Naniniwala ako na ang ating LGUs ay handa naman ang kanilang sistema, ang kanilang mga health protocols, ang kanilang quarantine, isolation guidelines, infection prevention control protocols, testing capacity, etc. para magluwag pa to MGCQ ang kanilang quarantine status,” Duque said during a Laging Handa briefing.
(We are ready. I believe that the LGUs are ready with their systems, their health protocols, their quarantine and isolation guidelines, infection prevention control protocols, testing capacity, etc. so they may loosen their quarantine status to MGCQ.)
“Pero mas mahalaga nito ang kakayanan nilang magsagawa ng localized lockdown,” he added.
(But more important is their ability to impose localized lockdowns.)
The health chief said it is no longer advisable to lockdown cities in their entirety. Instead, lockdowns should be localized, focusing on specific sitios within barangays or on specific streets and compounds.
Such localized lockdown is currently being done in Pasay City, which has seen an increase in COVID-19 cases in the past days.
Duque said local government have dealt with COVID-19 for a year and that they already know what must be done to curb the spread of the disease in their areas.
Last week, the National Economic and Development Authority head suggested the shift to MGCQ for the whole country to address poverty and unemployment.While this was backed by some officials, the proposal was questioned by Vice President Leni Robredo and some Metro Manila mayors who asked that the shift be more gradual.

During the past days, new COVID-19 cases from the NCR have again reached an average of at least 500 a day, which was last observed before the holiday season.Besides Pasay, other Metro Manila cities seeing a significant increase in COVID-19 cases are Malabon and Las Piñas, according to the OCTA Research Group.

MANILA (UPDATE) - COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer may arrive earlier than those from Sinovac, vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez said Tuesday.
PH about to secure 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine by next week, says official
COVID-19 vaccines on equal footing once approved for emergency use: DOH
The Philippines is a candidate for the early rollout of the drug from the COVAX facility, a global partnership that aims to ensure equitable distribution of the vaccines among countries, said Galvez.
""Baka mauna pa ang Pfizer because the COVAX facility will be deploying the early rollout of Pfizer, so iintayin din namin ‘yun sa February,"" he told ANC's Headstart.
""Natutuwa po kami kasi 20 million people will be benefitting from these free vaccines,"" he said.
(Pfizer may come earlier because the COVAX facility will be deploying the early rollout of Pfizer, so we will wait for that in February as well. We are glad because 20 million people will be benefitting from these free vaccines.)
Philippine officials will be meeting with representatives of the COVAX facility later Tuesday, he said.
The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on the emergency use authorization (EUA) of the British drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine within this week.FDA set to approve Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use
The Philippines has also secured 25 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Chinese manufacturer Sinovac, and some 50,000 are expected to arrive next month. Galvez said this is likely to be given to frontliners and healthcare workers in Metro Manila.Philippines secures 25 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from China's Sinovac

The first tranche of Sinovac vaccines will be used as 'rehearsal' for the actual national inoculation program, as more doses are expected in the coming months, he said.
""Ito yung tinatawag natin na rehearsal para matuto yung ating mga vaccinator at makita natin yung assimilation paano natin gagawin ang national rollout,"" he said.
(This is what we call rehearsal so our vaccinators can learn and we can see the assimilation, how we can do the national rollout.)
After the 50,000 in February, 950,000 doses will arrive in March, 1 million in April, another million in May, then 2 million in June and 3 million in July, said Galvez.
Training of about 25,000 vaccinators is ongoing and local governments are consolidating the list of individuals that will participate in the vaccinations, he said.

""We are trying to vaccinate at least 100 to 200,000 people every day. Yun po ang gagawin natin para at least magkaroon tayo ng record-breaking daily vaccination rollout,"" he said.
(We are trying to vaccinate at least 100 to 200,000 people every day. That's what we're trying to do so that we can have a record-breaking daily vaccination rollout.)
Galvez said apart from Sinovac and what could be given by the COVAX facility, there may be many other vaccines to arrive within the first quarter of this year as the government is currently negotiating with other governments.
On Monday, the Department of Health reported 2,052 additional COVID-19 cases, the highest single-day tally since Dec. 18 last year. This pushed the country's total to 489,736. In total, there were 9,416 fatalities and 458,206 recoveries.

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News
MANILA — After carrying out a two-day simulation of COVID-19 vaccinations prior to the arrival of the jabs, San Juan City's local government conducted another dry run on Thursday, this time showing how it plans to store the shots.
The simulation ran the process from storage to vaccination and post-vaccination observation to familiarize health care workers who were trained by the Department of Health (DOH).San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora said it would take up to 20 minutes for an individual to get inoculated after registration.San Juan residents can be ‘choosy’ with COVID-19 vaccines, says mayor
They should have their temperature checked first before entering the San Juan Gym, the city’s main vaccination center. They will then proceed to the registration and encoding area.
The city government also added another step for the vaccination process— counseling and final consent, where an audiovisual presentation will be shown to recipients.
After this, they will be screened by health workers to see if they are fit and well to get vaccinated.

Those already vaccinated will then be required to stay at an observation center located at the gym’s second floor for at least an hour, to check if there will be any immediate adverse reaction from the jab.
Dr. Rosalie Sto. Domingo, San Juan City Health Officer, explained that vaccinated residents would still be monitored for a year.
“Anything na magkaroon ng allergies, dito rin sa post-vaccination ma-observe, like pantal o nahirapan huminga. We will still monitor the patient for one year. Ipa-followup pa rin 'yan ano ba ang nararamdaman at may ibang reaction pa to see the effect of the COVID vaccine,” Domingo explained.

Barangay Health Emergency Response Teams (BHERT) will also respond to residents’ needs after vaccination, she said.“BHERT, nandyan sila para anything na ma-assist na madala sila sa ospital. Active ang barangays natin. Sila nagi-inform sa amin ng status ng ating constituents.”

ACCINE STORAGE
Zamora also showed the city’s refrigerators for AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccines it had purchased. The firm’s vaccines require storage temperature of between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius.The city prepared some 20 vaccine refrigerators, each of which can store up to 5,000 doses.
“Yung storage requirement is not complicated, 2 to 8 [degrees] Celsius. Hindi namin kailangan bumili ng mga bagong refrigerator. Sapat na gamitin ang existing naming facilities,” the mayor said.
(We do not need to buy new refrigerators because our existing facilities are enough.)
Aside from the initial order of AstraZeneca’s 100,000 vaccine doses, the city is also preparing for the arrival of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccines should the national government distribute it to local governments.Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said in a Metro Manila Council meeting that the national government would also distribute Pfizer’s vaccines to some cities. The American-based firm’s vaccines require a -70 degrees Celsius storage temperature for it to remain viable.
“Let’s assume both AstraZeneca and Pfizer arrive at the same time, we can now start the process. Kung magkasabay 'yan at pareho available na, hindi ko pipilitin ang mamamayan sa bakuna na ayaw nila. If it’s against their will, we will not do that. This is voluntary. We will never force them to get a vaccine they do not like,” Zamora said.
(If both of the vaccines arrive, I will not force my residents to be inoculated with a brand they do not prefer.)
The local chief executive reiterated that he would be the first to get the vaccine from AstraZeneca or Pfizer to increase vaccine trust and confidence among residents.
“Ako naniniwala na basta mataas ang tiwala at kumpiyansa ng mamamayan sa bakuna, sila po ay magpapalista para mabakunahan din. Basta sabihin ng aking mga doktor na ako ay fit mabakunahan ng AstraZeneca o Pfizer, ako ang unang magpapabakuna para ipakita sa lahat na ako bilang mayor nauna sa proseso ng pagpapabakuna,” he said.
“'Pag si mayor nauna, may tiwala siya sa bakuna. 'Pag umayaw siya, ibig sabihin may problema.”(I believe that as long as the residents have trust and confidence with the vaccine, they would enlist to be vaccinated. As soon as the doctors say I am fit to be vaccinated with AstraZeneca or Pfizer’s vaccine, I would be the first to get it. If a mayor gets the vaccine shots first, it just means that he trusts the vaccine. If he does not want to get inoculated, there is a problem.) ",abscbn

A recent study conducted by the OCTA Group showed that only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
The remaining 75 percent of respondents are mostly undecided (47 percent) or unwilling to be vaccinated (28 percent).
Among socio-economic classes, those in classes ABC were more willing to be vaccinated. Meanwhile, a third of those unwilling to be vaccinated were from class E. More than half of class ABC are also undecided or “can’t say” if they will have themselves vaccinated.

Dr. Nina Gloriani, University of the Philippines College of Public Health professor and head of the Department of Science and Technology’s vaccine technical panel, said they are just waiting for the response of pharmaceutical firms AstraZeneca and Janssen to their follow-up questions.
Once they are satisfied with the answers, their application may then be forwarded to the ethics review board. Once cleared by the board, they can undergo final evaluation by the Food and Drug Administration.
“We just have a few more comments. If they respond to that we should be granting technical clearance,” Gloriani said of AstraZeneca, which recently received regulatory approval in the United Kingdom.The Philippine private sector also recently signed a supply deal with the British vaccine manufacturer if it passes local regulations.

MANILA — Lack of thorough study on COVID-19 vaccines and concerns about their side effects topped the reasons why some health workers in the country refuse to be inoculated against the coronavirus, results of two surveys showed Thursday.
An online survey by the Department of Health (DOH) conducted on Dec. 29-30 last year showed that 8.27 percent of 1,245 health worker respondents said they are ""unlikely to be vaccinated"".
Sixty-one percent of them believe that the vaccines are ""not thoroughly studied"", thus their reason for having no interest in getting inoculated, while 20 percent are concerned about the side effects.

A separate survey by the Philippine Society for Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (PSMID) among 93 health care professionals revealed that 3 percent of them also refuse inoculation.
Seventeen respondents of the poll, held from Dec. 30, 2020 until Jan. 8 this year, expressed concern about the side effects of the COVID-19 vaccines.
Others picked the following reasons for their hesitation to receive a vaccine:I do not trust the country where the vaccine is manufactured (6 respondents)I want to see how it affects other people before getting it myself (4 respondents)""Too rushed"" vaccine development (2 respondents) I already had COVID-19 (2 respondents)Concerned about the vaccine's ingredients (1 respondent) It would be an unproven vaccine (1 respondent)I don't think the COVID-19 vaccine would protect me (1 respondent) I don't trust the government's immunization program (1 respondent)

Notably, the two surveys showed that majority of the respondents choose to receive a vaccine - 91 percent from the PSMID poll, and 63.29 percent from the DOH survey.
Even those ""unsure"" about taking a jab outnumber those who are unlikely to be vaccinated.
Six percent of the PSMID poll respondents and 28.43 percent from the DOH survey said they are ""not sure"" about getting inoculated.

MANILA — A Russian official on Monday raised doubt on the safety of potential coronavirus vaccines developed by the US and the UK, as Manila and Moscow continued talks for a clinical trial.The UK’s monkey adenovirus vaccine and the US messenger RNA “have never been studied longterm” and “have never received any approval before,” said Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) CEO Kirill Dmitriev.In contrast, the Russian coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V is a “modified” version of the human adenovirus vaccine against Ebola, he said.“We based it on an already proven approach that has been tried on lots of people, including the US military,” said Dmitriev, whose organization funded the Russian vaccine development.The UK and the US, he said, should publish studies showing that their vaccines “have no long term effects on increasing risk for cancer and infertility.”
“It’s just fair that we ask one question back because it’s about transparency , about honesty, and about people having information,” he said in an exclusive ANC interview.US floats idea of early approval for eventual vaccine
UK secures 90 million more doses of potential virus vaccine
Last week, Britain's prestigious scientific journal Lancet published research that early tests of Sputnik V showed encouraging results.Trial participants had “no significant side effects” and “on average developed 1.5 times the level of antibodies than a person who has been sick,” said Dmitriev.Russia this week will apply for World Health Organization’s pre-qualification process for the vaccine, he said.
Moscow and Manila are in talks for a clinical trial of Sputnik V. The Philippine health department last week stopped a planned trial in Cavite province for vaccines from the US and UK, pending approval from the local Food and Drug Administration.“We are very eager to start our clinical trials in the Philippines,” said Dmitriev. “We believe it’s possible to start them this month.”“We are in touch with your health ministry and once again, we agree that this issue should not be politicized. We should all be working together,” he added.

The adenovirus vaccine enters people's cells and delivers the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein genetic code, helping the immune system ""recognize and attack"" the virus, said Denis Logunov of Gamaleya, the research institute that created Sputnik V.The WHO insisted it would never endorse a vaccine that has not proven safe and effective and also said it did not expect widespread immunization against the novel coronavirus until mid-2021.The organization said a total of 176 potential vaccines were being developed worldwide, including 34 being tested on people. Among those, 8 are at stage 3, the most advanced.

“The one from WHO is a welcome addition to the regulatory approvals and therefore that would be a lot easier for the local FDA (Food and Drug Administration), to already review all the documents and assess the risk benefit ratio of the said candidate vaccine,” he said during a televised press conference at the East Avenue Medical Center.
FDA Director General Eric Domingo also told ABS-CBN News that the WHO emergency use listing ""is very significant.”
“Our experts are currently evaluating the documents submitted by Pfizer as outlined in our guidelines. I will issue a decision on the application as soon as all the regulatory requirements and procedures are completed,” he said in a statement.
Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine were among the first to declare its efficacy rate against COVID-19. With an efficacy rate of 95%, their vaccine was soon approved for emergency use by the United States and the United Kingdom.
They are also the only one so far that has applied for emergency use in the Philippines.
The FDA said it might be able to issue emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s vaccine by January.

With the emergency use authority powers granted to the FDA, the Philippines would be able to expedite its approval process for developmental drugs, especially for COVID-19.
The WHO on Friday said the Pfizer vaccine passed its safety criteria and has proven that its benefits outweigh the risks.
Duque was previously criticized for supposedly not being able to clinch a deal with Pfizer. This was denied by Duque who said the application still needed to undergo due process. He also said Pfizer never promised to provide the country 10 million doses as claimed by critics.

MANILA - Some 24,000 residents of San Juan City have signed up to get themselves inoculated with the vaccine against COVID-19, Mayor Francis Zamora said Monday.
This is almost 3 times the number it initially reported last month. Zamora said he has volunteered to be among the first ones to receive the vaccine to be able to boost his constituents' confidence about it.""As of today, we have 24,559 registrants. We were informed by DOH (Department of Health) that we are ranked number 1 in Metro Manila in terms of the number of registrants. I believe that by volunteering, it shows people that the vaccine process can be trusted, that the mayor himself will undergo the process,"" he told ANC's Headstart.
Zamora said the local government is going house to house to encourage residents to register for the vaccination, bringing along a tablet so that they may do so on the spot. Manual registration is also available at barangay halls and health centers, he said.
""I am very confident that here in San Juan, we will be able to vaccinate 100 percent of those who register and those who qualify with the medical clearance,"" he said.
San Juan has prepared at least 5 vaccination sites, including hospitals and transformed gymnasiums, where some 100 employees will be available to inject the drug into patients.
Zamora said first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine would be the 3,700 frontline and health workers in San Juan, to be followed by senior citizens and indigents.
The city targets to inoculate some 85,000 people to reach 70 percent of its population of 122,000. Zamora is ""very optimistic"" the current number of registrants will increase once the vaccination process is rolled out.
The local government of San Juan has signed a tripartite agreement with the national government and AstraZeneca for the procurement of 100,000 coronavirus shots.
Several Philippine LGUs sign deals to buy AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine
As the city is also part of Metro Manila, it may receive some vaccines from Pfizer, which will be given by the COVAX facility, he said.Zamora said if China-made Sinovac gets an emergency use authorization like AstraZeneca and Pfizer and if the national government gives assurance of its safety, then it may also be used.
A survey revealed by the Department of the Interior and Local Government on Sunday showed that only 3 out of 10 individuals in Metro Manila were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

Although this is much lower than the agency's target of immunizing at least 80 percent of the capital region's population, DILG Undersecretary Epimaco Densing III said government won't force the public to get their jabs, but it will double its efforts to encourage them.
As of Sunday, the Philippines has a total of 549,176 coronavirus cases, with 511,743 recoveries and 11,515 fatalities.

MANILA (UPDATE 2) - Three to 5 years to roll out the vaccine against COVID-19 is ""too long"" and will be ""too late"" for the Philippine economy to recover, Sen. Ralph Recto said on Tuesday as the Senate prepares to press the executive branch for its inoculation plan.
Vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr. said last month vaccinating 60 to 70 million Filipinos will be done over a ""3 to 5-year period.""
Malacañang also revealed the vaccine distribution will be done with a geographical and sectoral strategy, with priority given to COVID-19 hotspots, such as Metro Manila, Davao City and Bacolod City.
COVID-19 vaccination may take up to 5 years, 35M Pinoys on priority list: official
Government needs to address first the pandemic to bring back consumer and businesses' confidence to revive the economy, Recto said.
""We heard them also say 3-5 years. That’s too long. I don’t think it should take 5 years. I think our plan should be 2 years for the whole country. It will be hard to survive 3 to 5 years, that’s too long,"" he told ANC's Headstart.
""Saying that we will be able to vaccinate on 3-5 years does not provide confidence. Maraming missed opportunities, sayang. If we can show the public, ‘tingnan niyo 'yung healthcare workers natin binabayaran natin nang tama'...Say that 'we will vaccinate all of you, walang pilitan,' that will provide confidence.""
(There are many missed opportunities. If we can show the public, 'Our healthcare workers are being paid correctly'...Say that 'we will vaccinate all of you, we won't force you,' that will provide confidence.)
If government inoculates its citizens within 2 years, the Philippines will recover ""only the loss of P1.950 billion in the second half of 2022,"" he added.
""S'yempre takot ang consumer, worker, businessman to invest. In this scenario only government can make the investment, that’s why I’m saying the budget should be bigger and there’s a need to extend Bayanihan 2, the GAA (General Appropriations Act of 2020), maybe even a Bayanihan 3,"" he said.
(Of course consumers, workers, and businessmen are scared to invest.)
Recto said the Senate may resume session during the holidays to ""discuss with the executive the game plan.""
""(We want them to) tell Congress so we can approve the money necessary for it and we can help them in explaining that to the public,"" he said.
""We now are watching globally the vaccine rollout... Clearly, there is light at the end of the tunnel but that tunnel is still long so you still have to practice social distancing, handwashing, so on and so forth.""
Recto said among the questions lawmakers will want to tackle are: ""Which vaccines are we purchasing? Why are we purchasing them? What will be the quantity? When will be the delivery? What will be the manner of distributing this nationwide?""
The Philippines can also buy vaccines from other countries that ordered in excess of their population to address the depleting supply of the inoculation, the senator added.
""There are many countries who ordered vaccines more than their population, we can talk to them, pay them back.""
In the proposed budget submitted by Congress to President Rodrigo Duterte, some P2.5 billion is earmarked for the vaccination program under the Department of Health's budget. Another P70 billion in standby funds will be added from either approved loans or once the government exceeds its non-tax revenues targets. The stimulus plan Bayanihan 2 puts another P10 billion to the vaccine budget.
Recto is seeking a third Bayanihan Act to further stimulate the economy and support the vaccination plan to possibly include the whole Philippine population.
""Provide for 100 percent of the population without even mandating it, but it’s available. Kung gusto nila, pwede silang magpabakuna. That’s how it should work. Hindi yung 60 percent lang, 70 percent lang. Nagtitipid tayo,"" he said.
(Provide for 100 percent of the population without even mandating it, but it's available. If they want, they can get themselves vaccinated. That's how it should work. Not just inoculating 60 percent, 70 percent. We're being too thrifty.)
""Let’s get the best vaccine available. The most effective, the safest. Let’s not say na 'Ito mas mura 'to. Mababa effectiveness nito, safety nito pero mas mura 'to. Ito ang kunin natin.’ Let’s give the people the best available in the market,"" he added.
(Let's get the best vaccine available. The most effective, the safest. Let's not say, 'This is cheaper. It's less effective, less safe, but it's cheaper. Let's get this.' Let's give the people the best available in the market.)
The vaccines would be a small price to pay if it would help stimulate the economy, which shrunk this year, said Recto.

MANILA-- An independent body should monitor the conduct of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) chief said on Monday as it noted the need to ensure proper execution of testing protocols.
Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato dela Peña said a separate safety and monitoring committee should oversee trials in the Philippines along with the government's clinical trial team.
""...mag-create ng Safety and Monitoring Committee na ito ay magiging independent from the sponsor of the trial,"" he said in a Palace press briefing.

The government's pandemic task force earlier approved guidelines for the conduct of COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials which would require volunteers from villages with the highest number of coronavirus infections.
Dela Peña said the following hospitals will serve as the 8 trial zones under the World Health Organization's Solidarity Trials, a global coalition on the simultaneous development of vaccines:
- Philippine General Hospital

MANILA - Vice President Leni Robredo on Sunday told Filipinos not to be complacent against COVID-19 following a surge in cases in Metro Manila.
The Philippines rolled out its COVID-19 vaccination program last week, using jabs donated by Chinese drugmaker Sinovac Biotech, and then those from AstraZeneca acquired through the COVAX Facility.

MANILA - Quezon City mayor Joy Belmonte said Tuesday she was frustrated over the delayed arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, saying this would further delay the reopening of the country's economy.
""I would be lying to say that I'm not frustrated with the delay. We have already planned our vaccine program. We are very, very ready. Kulang na nga lang ang bakuna (What's missing are the vaccines),"" she told ANC.
Quezon City aims to vaccinate this year a total of 1.6 million people or 80 percent of its adult population to achieve herd immunity.Belmonte said they would have to change their vaccine program and rearrange the recipients to be first inoculated. This, after Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the Sinovac COVID-19 vaccine was likely to arrive first in the Philippines before the month ends.

State health regulator does not recommend using the Chinese-made jabs to health workers due to low efficacy rate of 50.4 percent.
""I think this will delay reopening up of MGCQ (modified general community quarantine) further because I think it is imperative that the riskiest population should be vaccinated first before we can really talk about reopening of economy,"" Belmonte said. ""So, therefore I think that the greatest consequence of this would be the further delay in reopening the economy.""
Belmonte said she was however elated that the national government postponed placing the entire country under the less restrictive modified general community quarantine.
""Relief is an understatement. I was extremely happy to hear about that because, first and foremost, I felt that before we can actually loosened to the extent that this required by the MGCQ, I felt that at least the healthcare workers should be vaccinated first because they're the ones who will bear the brunt of the effects,"" she told ANC.
Belmonte was among 8 mayors who voted to retain the general community quarantine status in Metro Manila amid the threat of COVID-19 spread.
""To be honest I was one of the 8 mayors that voted to retain GCQ status, albeit I voted for the second category which is slight relaxation of the GCQ protocols,"" she said.
Nine of the 17 Metro Manila mayors have voted to recommend placing the capital region under the most relaxed quarantine status in March to revive the country's ailing economy.

On Monday, President Rodrigo Duterte rejected proposals to implement MGCQ nationwide until the country's COVID-19 vaccination program has started.
In the event that the chief executive has decided to further ease quarantine restrictions, Belmonte said the city government was prepared in implementing relaxed protocols.She was however concerned that reopening the economy sans the vaccine could lead to a spike of COVID-19 infections.
""Based on our data here in Quezon City, most of our cases come from the workplace. People who go to work, bring home the virus and then they infect their entire community, and then what happens is whole household become infected,"" she said.
As of Feb. 21, Quezon City has recorded 31,912 coronavirus infections, data from the city's health department showed. The city's tally includes 30,150 recoveries, 929 active cases and 833 fatalities.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte's special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo said he has applied to be a Philippine distributor of Sinopharm vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by a Chinese government-owned pharmaceutical company.
In his column on Manila Times on Saturday, Tulfo also revealed that he was inoculated with Sinopharm's vaccine last year, along with other officials whose names he withheld.
""I now confess to the public: I had myself vaccinated — along with some government officials whose names I won’t mention here — with the Sinopharm vaccine last October. Some members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) were also injected with the same vaccine,"" Tulfo said.
Tulfo said he ""risked his life"" to have himself inoculated with the Sinopharm vaccine because he applied to be a local distributor.""That’s another confession: I have applied to be one of the distributors of the Sinopharm vaccine in the country, that’s why I risked my life to have myself inoculated ahead of the public,"" he added.
He also said Duterte expressed interest in having himself inoculated but was advised against doing so to avoid controversy.
The country's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has yet to approve for emergency use Sinopharm's vaccine.
As a Philippine government official, there is perceived a conflict of interest in Tulfo's application as a Philippine distributor of the Chinese vaccine.

MANILA (UPDATE) — Nearly half or 47 percent of Filipinos said late last year they would not get themselves vaccinated against COVID-19, according to results of a Pulse Asia survey revealed Thursday.
Of 2,400 adults surveyed on Nov. 23-Dec. 2 last year, 47 percent said they would skip the inoculation, while 32 percent said they would get vaccinated. Twenty-one percent were undecided.
The prevailing opinion was most popular in Visayas (55 percent), followed by Mindanao (48 percent), Balance Luzon (46 percent), and Metro Manila (41 percent).
Concern about the safety of the vaccines, at 84 percent, is primarily the reason of those who said they would not get vaccinated, according to the survey.

The sentiment was highest in Metro Manila at 89 percent, followed by Visayas at 88 percent, Balance Luzon at 84 percent, and Mindanao at 79 percent.
Meantime, some 5 percent said a vaccination was not required to combat COVID-19, while 7 percent were concerned that it might not be free, and 4 percent said it might be expensive.

That was a safety issue, they rushed it. It did not go through the medical community but straight to DepEd.)

""We need to make sure that we reach everybody with the correct information so that they can choose for themselves whether they will accept the vaccine or not.""
The Philippines is expected to begin its COVID-19 vaccination program in the second quarter as the first batch of its order from AstraZeneca is scheduled to arrive in May.
The Pulse Asia survey was conducted at a time when Pfizer and Moderna announced that their vaccines were 90 percent and 94.5 percent effective, respectively, based on their trials, the pollster said.
The country as of Wednesday reported 480,737 cases of COVID-19, with 22,690 active infections. It has yet to detect the new coronavirus variant, the health department said.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/01/08/21/chinese-expert-says-misquoted-on-post-about-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccines-side-effects-report,Chinese expert says misquoted on post about Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine’s side effects - report,ABS-CBN News,Jan 08 2021 07:39 PM,"MANILA — A vaccine expert from China who reportedly criticized the side effects caused by Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine clarified that his statement was supposedly meant as a disclaimer but that his words were taken out of context by foreign media.
In an interview on Global Times, an English-language Chinese newspaper under China-based People's Daily, Tao Lina said he listed Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine side effects satirically on Weibo, a Chinese microblogging site, for being lengthy.

FDA on Sinovac’s history of bribery: ‘Huwag nilang subukang manuhol’
He also reportedly pointed out that because such side effects are listed on the manual, patients who experience adverse reactions won’t be able to sue the state-owned pharmaceutical firm.


A Taiwan news report recently carried Tao’s statement, saying he had called the Chinese-made vaccine the “most unsafe in the world.”
""I did not say in the post that the Chinese vaccine was unsafe, because I know most of those 73 adverse reactions written on the Sinopharm vaccine user guide are non-existent,"" Tao was quoted as saying.
“You can never put too much emphasis on safety and efficacy. The attempts to discredit the image of Chinese vaccines' safety really makes me annoyed,” he added.
The Global Times report also said the Shanghai-based expert regretted that foreign media twisted his words to “support its own narrative” by emphasizing Tao’s expertise and him being a “former employee of the Shanghai disease prevention and control department.”
“This ironic way of pointing out the safety and efficacy of the Chinese vaccine was distorted by foreign media,” he said.
But Tao still defended his post on Weibo, which was allegedly taken down by authorities according to Taiwanese media.
He explained that Sinopharm vaccine's user guide had improper instructions written, and that it was inconclusive to say that “extreme adverse reactions such as high blood pressure are directly related to the vaccine.”
""It is possible that some irresponsible temporary employee made this user guide, which could have been wrongly written,"" he said.
Among the over 70 side effects mentioned in the Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine manual that he posted include pain, swelling and itching on the vaccination area.
The manual also reportedly mentioned headache, fever, muscle pain, difficulty breathing and diarrhea as common “systemic adverse reactions.”
Listed as “occasional” effects are anorexia and vomiting while “very rare” effects include asthma, tonsillitis, eye pain, vision loss, earache, high blood pressure, urinary incontinence and delayed menstruation.
Sinopharm is among the COVID-19 vaccine frontrunners. Its vaccine is already on limited use in China, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. It also claims to have a 79% efficacy rate against COVID-19.

In the same statement, posted at the same time of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Manila, Huang said the Philippines and China have worked closely ""to safeguard global and regional peace and stability"" over the past year, citing support ""on important multilateral and international occasions"" and commitment to safeguard ""UN-centered international system and the international order.""
Huang added the two counties ""have been committed to properly managing differences"" in the South China Sea ""through friendly negotiation and consultation despite external disruptions"" and that both sides have committed to work on oil and gas development cooperation.
However, there was no mention of the arbitral award that the Philippines won in 2016 in an international tribunal which invalidated China’s expansive claims in the South China Sea.
Huang expressed optimism that China and the Philippines would boost cooperation, citing the anti-pandemic response and assistance that both countries undertook.

MANILA - The Parañaque City government will allocate P250 million for its COVID-19 vaccination program, its mayor said Tuesday, as inoculation against the virus began in parts of the world.
""We will prioritize our frontliners, senior citizens and other vulnerable,"" Mayor Edwin Olivarez told Teleradyo's ""On The Spot.""
Some P200 million will be sourced from the 2021 general fund while the remaining P50 million will come from the budget of the local school board, he added.
Olivarez, also chairman of the Metro Manila Council, said most mayors in the Philippine capital had also earmarked funds for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccine next year.
""We are only waiting for guidelines from the DOH (Department of Health) and FDA (Food and Drug Administration) so we can purchase directly to the authorized pharmaceutical companies,"" he said in Filipino.
QC okays P1 billion for COVID-19 vaccine program
In early December, Quezon City said it was raising P1 billion to acquire vaccine for its residents. Manila and San Juan are also looking into spending P1 billion and P50 million for vaccine procurement, respectively, according to news reports.
Metro Manila, home to 12 million people, remains the country's epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis. It has tallied more than 209,000 coronavirus infections, latest data from DOH showed.
Quezon City and Manila have recorded the most COVID-19 infections with over 39,000 and 26,000 cases, respectively.
Meanwhile, Parañaque City has logged 8,049 coronavirus cases, of which 206 have died. Some 7,742 patients have recovered from the disease while 101 are still sick with the virus.
Amid the threat of a coronavirus variant that emerged in the UK, which experts said is more contagious, Olivarez told village chiefs to be vigilant.
""I ordered our village chiefs to keep a close watch on returnees from UK, South Africa, and Europe,"" he said in Filipino.

The move by President Xi Jinping to offer up a Chinese vaccine worldwide as a ""public good"" also allows Beijing to paint itself as a leader in global health, said the CFR's Huang, seizing a mantle left untended as the US retreated under Donald Trump's ""America First"" doctrine.
Washington is notably absent from a global alliance of 189 countries that have pledged to distribute vaccines equitably. Beijing signed up in October as its drugmakers launched final stage trials.
But this program has only secured enough doses to cover 20 percent of the population of low- and middle-income countries by the end of next year -- offering a commercial opportunity.
China is ramping up production facilities to make one billion coronavirus shots next year -- and, having largely tamed the outbreak at home, it will have a surplus to sell.
If China can capture just 15 percent of the market in middle and low-income countries, it would net around $2.8 billion in sales, according to an estimate by Essence Securities, a Hong Kong-based brokerage firm.

Sai Aung Main, AFP
MANILA (UPDATE2) — The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday granted British company AstraZeneca emergency use authorization (EUA) for its COVID-19 vaccine, 3 weeks after its application.
“After a thorough review of the currently available data by our medical and regulatory experts, the FDA is granting an emergency use authorization to the COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
EFFICACY RATE
This makes AstraZeneca’s vaccine the 2nd, after Pfizer's, to be approved for emergency use in the Philippines where 518,407 coronavirus infections have so far been confirmed.
READ: PH logs 2,245 new COVID-19 cases, highest since November; addt’l deaths at 95
“The vaccine regimen consists of 2 equal standard doses of .5mL, each given 4 to 12 weeks apart,” Domingo said.
He said the vaccine has an efficacy rate of 70% after the first dose, and trials are ongoing to determine the efficacy rate after the 2nd dose.
READ: German vaccine institute praises efficacy of AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine
AstraZeneca previously caused confusion after it announced that a lower dosing regimen, involving use of half only of the first dose, resulted in higher efficacy.
But Domingo explained that the company found out that “the longer interval between the 2 doses was deemed responsible for the higher immunogenicity in the group that was given the lower 1st dose.”
This is why the Philippines will be following the standard regimen of 2 full doses given 4 to 12 weeks apart, he said.
While it is only 70% effective in preventing COVID, Domingo said those who took part in the trial only had mild to moderate symptoms of the disease.
“Yung data naman ng AstraZeneca shows that it is very good in preventing severe COVID-19. Halos 100% din. Kaya lang, siyempre, medyo maliit pa ang datos nila at maa-update pa yan as we get more data on the people included in the clinical trial,” he said.
(The data of AstraZeneca shows that it is very good in preventing severe COVID-19 - almost 100%. However, their data is still not sizable and it will get updated as we get more data on the people included in the clinical trial.)

STORAGE
While the initial rate is lower than the efficacy rate of vaccine frontrunners Pfizer and Moderna, which have rates of around 95%, AstraZeneca seems to be more favored by local government units in the Philippines because of its storage requirements.

Unlike those requiring ultra cold freezers, AstraZeneca’s vaccine can be kept in regular refrigerator temperatures as with more common vaccines kept by the Department of Health.
“The advantage of this vaccine is that it is stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees. Hindi sya masyadong maselan, at madali syang ma-transport at i-store sa lugar ng pagbabakunahan,” Domingo said.
(The advantage of this vaccine is that it is stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees. It is not that sensitive, and it can easily be transported and stored at the vaccination site.)
SIDE EFFECTS
Domingo said there are also no special precautions specific for AstraZeneca’s vaccine, although that may change as more countries use it.
“Ang nakitang adverse effects niya are all very mild, very similar to getting any flu injection na karamihan ay pananakit sa lugar ng injection, konting sinat, konting sakit ng ulo that are all transient and easily managed,” he said.
(The adverse effects seen for this vaccine are all very mild, very similar to getting any flu injection - soreness in the injection site, slight fever, headache that are all transient and easily managed.)
Up to 39 local government units have signed a tripartite agreement with the national government and the private sector to secure 17 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine.
“This is great news! We are very happy to hear this and we look forward to the arrival of our order from them,” Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto said of the FDA's approval, in a text message to ABS-CBN News.
Pasig City is the first local government unit in the country to gain the national government’s approval on vaccination plan. The city is also among the Health Department’s chosen site for the vaccine simulation.
But there is no definite date yet as to when vaccines are expected to arrive in the city.
“I’m sure they will get it here as soon as possible, all factors considered,” Sotto said.
In a separate statement, San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora said the ""FDA’s approval is a validation that purchasing from AstraZeneca is the right decision"".
“An EUA from the FDA assures us that the vaccine has been well studied and reviewed by experts, and is safe for public use,” he said.
Zamora assured the LGU continues to prepare and fine tune the vaccination process as the city looks forward to the delivery of the vaccines.
Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said Wednesday he is expecting 200,000 to 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine among the estimated 1 million vaccine doses the country will get next month.

AstraZeneca is one of the few vaccine developers that have received EUAs from stringent regulatory authorities (SRA) recognized by the World Health Organization, allowing its application to be expedited by the FDA.
The FDA had said those with approval from SRAs, like Pfizer's, can be approved within 21 days from application.
The remaining 3 companies awaiting FDA's EUA approval for their vaccine candidates are Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, China’s Sinovac, and India's Bharat Biotech.

Russian Direct Investment Fund, Handout/AFPMANILA-- Participation in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials could guarantee the Philippines access to a possible drug against the new coronavirus that has upended life globally, the country's Department of Science and Technology said Wednesday.
If Manila joins vaccine clinical trials, it would be given access to the drug, said Jaime Montoya, executive director of the DOST-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development.
""May garantiya, 'pag napatunayang epektibo ang bakuna, kailangan siyang maging available sa bansa,"" Montoya told lawmakers during deliberations over the proposed 2021 national budget.
(There is guarantee that a vaccine proven effective should also be available in the country where it was tested.)
Joining clinical trials could also prepare the country on the use of COVID-19 vaccines, he said, noting that the country's Food and Drug Administration is also in favor of holding tests in the Philippines to speed up registration for commercial use.
""Pinakamahalaga, magkakaroon ng karanasan at malalaman natin kung [ang] pagresponde sa bakuna ay angkop at tama, base sa nakita sa ibang bansa,"" Montoya said.
(What's important is that we will have experience and see if the response to the vaccine is correct, based on the experience of other countries.)

(Our own FDA also prefers local clinical trials to see if Filipinos have a positive response to the vaccine. This way, the registration of products will be faster and can be made available commercially.)
The government's pandemic response task force earlier said the Philippines would prioritize vaccine trials under the World Health Organization Solidarity Trial program.
Manila has ongoing vaccine discussions with Beijing and Moscow, with Russia's COVID-19 vaccine already approved for human clinical trials in the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte even volunteered himself to be inoculated in public with the Russian drug.
How will the Philippines run COVID-19 vaccine trials?
DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña meanwhile assured lawmakers that strict ethical standards would be observed for clinical trials, noting that Filipino participants ""must adhere to certain conditions.""

MANILA - Some 116,000 health workers in Metro Manila have been initially listed for COVID-19 vaccination, the Department of Health said Friday, as the agency finalizes its master list of eligible recipients.
Dr. Razel Nikka Hao, deputy to the COVID-19 surveillance and quick action unit of DOH, said the data came from submissions of different health facilities in the Philippine capital, which is the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis.
""At this point, we are in the process of master listing for group A1 or all of the workers in the frontline health-care services,"" she said in a press briefing.
""As early as January of this year, we have reached out to the facilities and the local governments who will encompass this group A1.""
In the government's vaccination plan, health workers shall first receive the COVID-19 jabs. They are followed by older people, persons with comorbidities or underlying conditions, other essential workers, including uniformed personnel, and indigent population -- all in group A.
Next in the priority list is group B, which are other frontline workers and special population. The remaining population or group C is at the bottom of the pile.
Hao said the number of eligible health workers may also change as health facilities were in the process of profiling their staff.

Meanwhile, master listing of other priority groups will come in the next coming months, she said.
""They are still in the process of going through each of their staff to find out who have comorbidities or have exclusion,"" Hao added.
The health agency is already coordinating with the Department of Social Welfare and Development and other groups for an initial list of older people and indigents.

The DOH earlier said it was set to finalize by Feb. 15 the list of health workers who will be prioritized in the government’s massive inoculation program. It plans to start immunization this month.

In a statement, CHR Commissioner Gwendolyn Pimentel-Gana said it is the Philippine government’s responsibility to ensure that vaccines would be available even to the remotest parts of the country.
“A growing number of highly resourced local governments in the urban centers and metropolitan areas [are] lining up to gain immediate and priority access to COVID-19 vaccines seemingly ahead of others,” Gana pointed out.

“Vaccines must be as accessible for Filipinos in urban cities as well as those situated in far-flung areas of the country where there is a known cluster of infected population,” she added.
At least 61 cities have already committed over P10 billion to secure their own supplies of COVID-19 vaccines, according to the League of Cities.
Several cities in Metro Manila, meanwhile, announced they have already signed agreements for the advanced purchase of vaccine jabs, most of which are from British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca.

But Gana expressed concern that not all LGUs have enough financial resources to order vaccines in advance.
“The national government must step in to maintain a balanced access to the COVID-19 vaccines… An effective national vaccine rollout means a vaccine is made available to one living in urban Manila in about the same time to one recipient based in Sulu,” said the commissioner.
“An efficient vaccination system promotes the universal quest for everyone to be accorded the right to a standard of living adequate for one’s health and well-being, especially in the aspect of medical care.”


LGUs and private firms have helped lock in 17 million doses so far of the COVID-19 vaccine from AstraZeneca.
The Philippines has also secured 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech, and 30 million doses from the Serum Institute of India.

MANILA - The public is urged to continue following minimum health standards as vaccination against COVID-19 may take several years, the World Health Organization said Monday.
It is necessary to sustain performing hand hygiene, observing physical distancing, and wearing of face masks as these have been proven to be effective not just against the coronavirus but also in suppressing its new variants, said Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, WHO Representative to the Philippines.
""The vaccines are not going to help open the world right now. We will still need to follow all the behaviors we've been following over the last 1 year because the transmission is going to continue and we’re not going to be able to vaccinate everybody probably for another 2 years or more,"" he told ANC's Headstart.
""In that, we’re talking about nobody is absolutely safe until the whole world is safe.""

Government is urged to continue to monitor the pandemic ""very carefully and be proactive"" to prevent large-scale lockdowns that have economic consequences, Abeyasinghe said.
As for face to face classes, the WHO representative said the level of virus transmission must be taken into account.
""If the pandemic transmission is decreasing, there may be an opportunity for us to open up schools. Where you're seeing increased transmission in the community, countries which opened up schools have seen significantly higher proportion of infection among children. So this something that needs to be weighed and balance,"" he said.
""Another thing we need to factor in is congestion in schools, the access to hand hygiene.""
The WHO does not have a ""clear decision"" on requiring vaccination documents to be able to travel, according to Abeyasinghe.
The international body also has yet to confirm any positions or findings about the new COVID-19 variants which reportedly are more contagious and may lead to severe cases, he added.
""It’s not surprising that we’re seeing the emergence of new variants. The critical issue is to understand what is the capacity of these new variants,"" he said.
""These issues are being studied jointly with WHO and the respective countries seeing those variants. Data is very premature and it needs to be carefully evaluated.""
The Philippines has reported 17 cases of the UK variant of COVID-19, which is among the country's 525,618 confirmed coronavirus infections, as of Sunday.
Globally, nearly 103 million infections have so far been tallied by the US-based Johns Hopkins University, including over 2.2 million deaths.

In a pre-recorded video message to the UN convention that aired early Wednesday (Manila time), Duterte emphasized ""ensuring universal access"" to medicines and technology to combat COVID-19 ""is pivotal in the global pandemic recovery.""
""The world is in the race to find a safe and effective vaccine. When the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor withheld. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy,"" he said during the UN's 75th anniversary.
""The Philippines joins our partners in the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and the Non-Aligned Movement in raising our collective voice: the COVID-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good.""
Duterte earlier called out Western countries and companies for allegedly profiting from the coronavirus pandemic.

A worldwide race for a coronavirus vaccine is underway, with at least 9 pharmaceutical firms in the US and Europe in late-stage trials.
Duterte urged UN members to pool resources to ""empower"" the World Health Organization, which has been battered by the pandemic and criticisms from some countries, like the United States.
""We need a WHO that is quick to coordinate and quicker to respond. The Philippines will do its part in the pooling of global resources. Our health workers are among the best,"" he said.
BIGGEST TEST SINCE WWII
The President said the pandemic is the ""biggest test"" the world and the UN is facing since World War 2.
""We are at a crossroads. How we address COVID-19 will define our future,"" he said.
Duterte said coordination of plans and courses of action between member states is vital while each country fights the pandemic with its own strategy since ""COVID-19 knows no border.""He welcomed the launch of UN COVID-19 Response and Recovery Fund, which is UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' project designed to aid low and middle-income countries to overcome the health and development crisis caused by the pandemic and support those severely affected by the economic toll and social disruption it caused.

MANILA — The Department of Health on Wednesday said it still does not have a confirmed date for the arrival of the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines and when inoculations may begin.
Palace says Philippines ready to start COVID-19 vaccinations next week
“The COVAX Facility initially told us by 2nd or 3rd of February. Now this February 15 is an indicative date,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a virtual briefing.
The COVAX Facility is a global initiative, composed of groups including the World Health Organization, that aims for equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines around the world.
“Wala pa tayong confirmed dates as to when are we going to start.
Definitely 'pag dumating 'yung bakuna after 2 to 3 days we will start the deployment already. We will start the vaccination already makatapos dumating dito,” Vergeire said.
(We still do not have the confirmed dates as to when are we going to start. Definitely, when the vaccine arrives, after 2 to 3 days we will start deployment already. We will start the vaccination already after it arrives.)
The country will get some 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the COVAX Facility in the first quarter, including 117,000 doses of the Pfizer jabs, vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said.
The government has been preparing for the arrival of the vaccines to ensure that they are kept in good quality and in proper temperature levels while being transported to different storage facilities.

MANILA - In his second appearance at the United Nations, President Rodrigo Duterte renewed his call for universal and inclusive access to COVID-19 vaccines, as their development by year's end is near realization while the coronavirus pandemic still rages on.
Duterte, in a video message at UN early Friday morning (Manila time), said all countries should get access to coronavirus vaccines once these have been developed, deemed effective, and distributed to the public.
""The Philippines reiterates the call for the universal access of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and technologies. If any country is excluded by reason of poverty or strategic unimportance, this gross injustice will haunt the world for a long time,"" he said.
""We cannot let this happen. No one is safe unless everyone is safe.""
His renewed call for inclusive vaccine access comes after drugmakers Moderna, Pfizer Inc., and AstraZeneca declared their COVID-19 vaccines showed efficacy results 90 percent and above.
Moderna says its vaccine is 94.5% effective in preventing COVID-19

Duterte urged UN member states to boost the capacity of their health systems as the world waits for the full development and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.
""Our first priority is to strengthen the capacity of health systems. Without a cure and a vaccine, we can only delay the spread of the disease while we open our economies. Life-saving services and products must be made accessible to the most vulnerable,"" he said.
He affirmed the Philippines' support for the global scientific initiatives by the World Health Organization, such as the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, the COVAX Facility, and the COVID-19 Technology Access Pool (C-TAP). He assured the Philippines' participation in pooling of global funds and resources to combat COVID-19 worldwide.
""The end of this pandemic is still difficult to see, yet the broad outlines of the horizon are breaking through. It is never too early to think of a bouncing-back strategy,"" he said.
""Now is the time to further strengthen our networks of solidarity and cooperation...the time is now for greater collective courage, meaningful actions to see the end of this pandemic.""
In his first appearance at the UN, Duterte described the pandemic as the ""biggest test"" the world and the UN is facing since World War 2.

The Philippines earlier allowed its Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to issue emergency use authorization for COVID-19 vaccines and drugs. The emergency use authorization “shall be valid only within the duration of the declared public health emergency due to COVID-19,” said Duterte.Philippines allows emergency use of COVID-19 vaccines, drugs
As of posting, the Philippines has 435,413 confirmed cases of COVID-19. Of the total, 399,325 have recovered while 8,446 died, leaving at least 27,642 active cases in the country.
According to the Johns Hopkins University dashboard, at least 64.8 million people worldwide have been infected with COVID-19, with nearly 1.5 million fatalities, a year after the deadly disease first emerged in Wuhan, China.

The Philippines received 600,00 doses of the COVID19 vaccines from Bejing-based Sinovac Biotech on February 28 as the health departments aims to roll out the administration of the vaccine in 2-3 weeks. PCOO-OGMPA
MANILA (UPDATE) — Philippine General Hospital (PGH) head Gerardo Legaspi on Monday received the first authorized dose of COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines, just several hours after a batch of donated doses from the Chinese company Sinovac arrived in the country.
In a live feed of the vaccination via PTV, Legaspi received the CoronaVac jab from PGH nurse Chareluck Santos.
After being inoculated, he presented a certificate showing that he received the vaccine.

""Ang asawa ko po at anak, kinausap ko kahapon dahil hyper-allergic sila, malamang itong bakuna ang i-recommend ko sa kanila,"" Legaspi said during a briefing after he was vaccinated.
(I talked to my wife and child yesterday, and because they are hyper-allergic, I might recommend this for them.)
Meet Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, the first to be officially vaccinated against COVID-19 in PH
The vaccine developed by Sinovac is said to have only common vaccine side effects. No adverse or serious side effects or allergic reactions have been observed among those vaccinated with it.
Second to be vaccinated is Dr. Edsel Salvana, who is part of the Department of Health Technical Advisory Group and also a PGH doctor.
Next in line was Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo.

Legaspi and the other vaccine recipients were monitored for 30 minutes for possible side effects.
Also vaccinated at the PGH were Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos, Jr. and vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque was also seen being screened for the Sinovac vaccine. But the tight supply of the shots prevented him from getting inoculated.
""Ako po, willing mabakunahan. Kaya lang, kagaya ng sinabi ni [PGH Director] Dr. Gap Legaspi ay ubos na iyong 100 [doses] nila for the day ‘no. We will have to come back on another day,"" Roque told reporters in an online briefing.
(I am wiling to get vaccinated. But, as Dr. Gap Legaspi said, their 100-dose allocation for the day has been used up.)
During his speech before the vaccination, Galvez said that while there are other vaccines with higher efficacy rate, “There is no such best vaccine dahil ang pinaka-best vaccine ay yung effective at efficient na dumarating ng mas maaga.”
(There is no such best vaccine because the best vaccine is the one that is effective and efficient that arrived earlier.)
PGH spokesman Dr. Jonas Del Rosario, who was earlier reported to be the first to receive the shot, said he was not vaccinated after latest tests showed he had a high amount of antibodies after recovering from COVID-19 last year.
He said he expects more health workers to get inoculated after 90 percent of PGH workers said they preferred a different vaccine.The Philippines is the last Southeast Asian country to receive initial vaccine supplies, fueling concerns over recovery prospects for a consumption-driven economy that suffered its worst slump on record last year due to the lengthy coronavirus lockdowns.A total of 1,200 doses were sent to the PGH on Monday after the Chinese company’s vaccines arrived in the country on Sunday.
Sinovac has an efficacy rate of 65.3% to 91.2%, based on vaccinations in Indonesia and Turkey. But its efficacy rate among health workers exposed to COVID-19 in Brazil was only 50.4%.While this is above the World Health Organization benchmark of 50%, it is significantly lower than other vaccine frontrunners like Pfizer and Moderna with 95% efficacy.
The Philippines has issued emergency use authorization for Sinovac, Pfizer and AstraZeneca. Pfizer was supposed to be the first COVID-19 vaccine with an EUA to arrive in the Philippines, but it was delayed due to the indemnification agreement requirement.
There have been reports of smuggled COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines. Last year, members of the Presidential Security Group were inoculated using the vaccine candidate of another Chinese drugmaker, Sinopharm.

Galvez said he was personally instructed by President Rodrigo Duterte to be vaccinated at the PGH to address the low confidence of health workers towards Sinovac.
“Kahapon, binigyan niya (Duterte) ako ng utos na 'Magpabakuna ka para at least it will make them (health workers) feel na ang ating pamahalaan, ang lahat ng mga bakuna na inaangkat natin ay safe and effective',” said Galvez, a retired military general.
(Yesterday, he ordered me to be vaccinated so at least it will make health workers feel that our government is importing vaccines that are safe and effective.)
Health workers are first in line in the Philippines’ priority recipients of COVID-19 vaccines.
LIST: Sub-groups in COVID-19 vaccination priority
Surveys from different hospitals showed high confidence in the vaccines against the coronavirus.l But some reports, like that of PGH, showed a much lower rate of health workers willing to be vaccinated with Sinovac’s vaccine.
Galvez said that while efficacy rate in preventing COVID-19 may only be at 50%, there is 100% protection against severe illness and death.
Other hospitals that received vials of the Sinovac vaccine were military hospital V. Luna Medical Center; Dr. Jose N Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Tala, Caloocan; the Pasig City General Hospital; the Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame; and the Lung Center of the Philippines.Of the 600,000 donated Sinovac vaccines, 100,000 are supposed to be allocated for the Department of National Defense (DND).
In a statement, the DND said it will initially inoculate 14,520 individuals using 29,040 doses, and the remaining 70,960 doses will be given to the Armed Forces of the Philippines.
The government aims to vaccinate 50 to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year, depending on the supply of vaccines.
Expected to arrive next are doses from AstraZeneca through the COVAX Facility, which aims for equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
No definite arrival date yet of delayed AstraZeneca vaccine - Galvez
Besides the donated doses, the Philippines is also expected to procure vaccines from Sinovac.

The Philippines in March will get 1 million more Sinovac shots, and 3.5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine fro Britain's AstraZeneca, said Galvez.Doses that will not be used by health workers would go to essential government workers like barangay emergency response teams, and ""influencers"" like mayors who could boost vaccine confidence, he said.
The Philippines has seen a resurgence of COVID-19 cases in some areas like several cities in Metro Manila. Currently, there are a total of 578,381 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country, of which, 31,708 or 5.5 percent are active infections.
PH reports over 2,000 new COVID-19 cases for 5th straight day, as vaccination starts
Besides the increase in cases in some areas, the Philippines is also monitoring the possible spread of new COVID-19 variants of concern, some of which are said to be more transmissible.
The Philippines' first COVID-19 case was reported on Jan. 30 last year in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan City, China where the disease is believed to have first emerged.

To date, 11,500 San Juan residents have pre-registered for the vaccinations, which is why Zamora said the biggest challenge is how to restore public confidence in the coronavirus vaccines, amid hesitancy due to the controversy over anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia.

Zamora walked the media through the city’s main COVID-19 vaccination facility at the San Juan Gym, located beside the San Juan hospital.
Aside from the main vaccination facility at the ground floor, an observation center is also set up at the gym’s second floor where those vaccinated are required to stay for at least an hour for any immediate adverse reaction.
The city has earmarked an initial P50 million for the procurement of the COVID-19 vaccines.
Zamora said if cleared by his physician, he will be the first to receive inoculation to encourage more residents to have themselves vaccinated.

The SARS-CoV-2, the new strain of virus that causes COVID-19, was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan last year.
The Philippines recorded its first COVID-19 case last Jan. 30 in a Chinese woman who arrived from Wuhan. As of June 13, the country has logged 25,392 confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 5,706 recoveries and 1,074 deaths.

Esper also expressed appreciation for the DND’s support for the Philippine government’s decision to suspend the termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement, the agency said.
Earlier this month, the government suspended the abrogation of the VFA with the US “in light of political and other developments in the region.”

The termination of the VFA, a pact signed in 1998 to govern the conduct of American forces in the country, was initiated by the Philippines in February on orders of Duterte after the US visa of his ally and former chief implementer of the government's war on drugs, Sen. Ronald ""Bato"" Dela Rosa, was cancelled.
The abrogation would have taken effect 180 days after Manila served the notice to the US embassy.
Esper and Lorenzana also discussed the security situation in the South China Sea, counter-terrorism, and logistics cooperation, particularly on the capability upgrade of the Philippine military, the DND said.

A survey, meanwhile, would be conducted to determine the public’s brand of choice. The city also planned to launch an online system through the use of QR codes for the residents’ registration.

Ynares added she did not prefer any vaccine brand, and that the local government would not have any problems in handling the first vaccine to arrive in their city.“Siguro wala naman, lahat sila OK. Kasi naniniwala ako kay Presidente [na] he’s only after ’yung health ng bawat isa sa atin. Hindi naman niya tayo para ipahamak,” she said.

The cold storage facility will be suitable for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccines, which requires a storage temperature of -18 degrees to -20 degrees Celsius, and Oxford-AstraZeneca’s vaccines at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius.Another storage, however, will be needed for Pfizer’s vaccines, which should be kept at -70 degrees Celsius.
The mayor estimated rolling out COVID-19 vaccines in her city around the 3rd quarter this year.According to city health officers, about 200 to 250 COVID-19 vaccine teams composed of city health doctors, nurses, midwives, government hospital workers, barangay health workers, nutrition scholars and encoders would be tapped to lead the rollout.
Possible vaccination sites include barangay covered courts, chapels, national high schools, universities, malls, and clubhouses.
Dr. Concepcion Lat, Antipolo’s City Health Officer, said a site for Adverse Events Following Immunization Monitoring would also be set up for those who might exhibit unusual or severe side effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.Triage and screening process, meanwhile, will be vital to ensure that the individuals receiving the COVID-19 vaccine have no recent exposure to a COVID-19 patient, or are not COVID-19 suspects, Lat said during an orientation with local health workers.
Antipolo has also urged the national government to provide health supplies needed by health workers during the vaccine rollout, including personal protective equipment, gloves, and syringes, among others.The LGU is also planning the proper waste disposal of medical supplies especially once the vaccination program begins. — Angel Movido, ABS-CBN News",abscbn

MANILA - Returning Filipinos who have received a COVID-19 vaccine or have a negative swab test result will still undergo the mandatory 14-day quarantine upon arrival in the Philippines, the Bureau of Immigration said Sunday.
The Philippines earlier expanded its travel restrictions to 21 territories to prevent the entry of a more contagious coronavirus variant.

Several countries in the list, including the US and the UK, have begun their respective COVID-19 vaccination programs.
""Sa ngayon po, wala pa po tayong guidelines with regard to that (those already vaccinated). Even yung mga nagpapakita ng negative RT-PCR test, they would still have to undergo the quarantine period, (at) kahit yung mga nabakunahan ngayon,"" Immigration spokesperson Dana Sandoval told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.

Filipinos who had a layover in the 21 areas on which Manila imposed travel restrictions will be allowed to enter the Philippines but will also have to undergo quarantine, Sandoval said.
""Kung galing lang po sila doon sa 21 countries at nag-layover po, meaning di po sila lumabas ng airport, hindi sila cleared ng immigration dun at merely nag-transit po, pwede na po sila papasukin ng bansa. But they would still have to undergo po the regular procedures ng ating one-stop shop,"" she said.

Kasama sa paguusapan aniya ay kung anong pasilidad ang kakailanganin ng lungsod.“Siguro kailangan nila malalaking simbahan so maghahanap kami. Kung ano 'yung mga kinakailangan nilang facilities at kung saang area,” sabi ni Pabillo sa panayam sa TeleRadyo Biyernes ng umaga.
Paliwanag ni Pabillo, may pasilidad ang ibang simbahan tulad ng gym at hall na pwedeng magamit.
Maaari rin tumulong ang mga kawani ng simbahan sa pagbabantay sa vaccination sites.
“Itong inaalok namin sa Archdiocese of Manila lang ito. Siyempre, ang ibang mga dioceses may iba iba rin silang pag-uusap ng kanilang local officials,” sabi ni Pabillo.
Handa rin naman silang makipag-usap sa iba pang mga lungsod na nasa ilalim ng Archdiocese of Manila tungkol dito.
Nauna nang sinabi ng Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) na handa silang ialok ang mga pasilidad ng mga simbahan para gawing mga lugar para sa vaccination program ng bansa.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Wednesday threw his support behind the decision of Sec. Carlito Galvez Jr., to order the COVID-19 vaccine made by Sinovac Biotech, amid criticisms about China-made vaccine's efficacy.
Duterte, in his weekly public address, said he is not forcing local government officials from getting the same vaccine brand if they have the resources to buy from other pharmaceutical companies.
""Maraming local government units who opted to go on their own. Sila ang magbili, may pera sila, at sila ang mamili ng kanilang vaccine,"" he said during his weekly public address.
(Many local governments opted to go on their own. They will use their own money to choose and buy their own vaccines.)
""We are not forcing anybody to join the cause of the national government. Hindi namin pinipilit na sumali kayo sa ibibigay na bakuna ng national government,"" Duterte added.
(We are not forcing anybody to join the cause of the national government. We are not forcing you to join the vaccination program of the national government.)
Duterte claimed Sinovac's COVID-19 vaccine is just as good as those made by other manufacturers.
""The bakuna (vaccine) that Sec. Galvez is buying is as good as any other bakuna na naimbento ng mga Amerikano o ng mga Europeans (vaccine developed by the Americans or Europeans),"" he said.
""Hindi nagkulang ang Chinese, hindi sila nagkulang sa utak. Bright itong mga Intsik and they would not venture kung hindi sapat, if it is not safe, sure and secure... That is the guarantee,"" Duterte said.
(The Chinese are good. They are bright enough not to venture into something if it is not safe, sure and secure. That is the guarantee.""
However, the coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac only showed a ""general efficacy"" of 50.4 percent in a late-stage trial in Brazil, the company's local partners said on Tuesday.
Piecemeal disclosure from global studies of the vaccine, called CoronaVac, have added to concerns that immunizations developed by Chinese producers are not subject to the same public scrutiny as US and European alternatives.

According to data from Senator Sonny Angara's office, two doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Sinovac are priced at P3,629, making it the second most expensive vaccine next to Moderna, which is priced at P3,904 to P4,504 for two doses.
Meanwhile, two doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine only cost P610.
Most local government units, including Duterte's hometown Davao City, ordered the COVID-19 vaccine made by AstraZeneca.

RESPONSIBILITY
Duterte said he supports Galvez and whatever decision the latter makes is as good as his.
""Ako, kung ano ang piliin ni Sec. Galvez, would bind me. Parang ako na rin ang bumili ng bakuna. So hindi ako magbili ng bakuna na hindi tama,"" he said.
(I am bound by Sec. Galvez's choice. It's like I am the one who bought the vaccines, so I will not buy something that is not right.)
""Ultimately, actually, sa lahat ng ito, kung may bulilyaso, 'yung amin sa gobyerno na pinili at nine-negotiate ngayon, kung may bulilyaso, at the end of the day, akin talaga 'yang responsibilidad,"" Duterte added.
(Ultimately, actually, at the end of everything, of there will be a problem, at the end of the day, it will be my responsibility.)
Duterte also told local government officials that although they have the freedom to choose which brand of vaccine to buy, there are still laws to follow.
""I'm now addressing myself to the mayors, governors. You can choose any vaccine you like to buy. Wala kaming pakialam kung ano ang pipiliin ninyo. Hindi kami makiaalam sa lahat ng bagay in the purchase,"" he said.
(I'm now addressing myself to the mayors, governors. You can choose any vaccine you like to buy. We will not meddle in your choice. We will not interfere in the process of purchasing the vaccines.)
""Alam ninyo kasi may batas tayo na lahat ng medisina, whatever nature and whatever be its characteristics, magdaan talaga muna ng pagsilip sa gobyerno. Ang gobyerno kasi ang last eh. Ang gobyerno kasi ang babagsak dito, after sa bakuna ng iba tapos may babagsak na 5,000 Filipino, ililibing ako dito,"" Duterte added.
(We have laws that all medicines, whatever their nature or characteristics may be, it should first be checked by the government. The government will ultimately be affected. If 5,000 Filipinos suffer from the vaccines, I will be buried.)
Duterte also claimed that the Philippines is at the tail-end of the vaccine supply chain since other countries have already secured their own supply.
""Wala pa ang supply natin, ginagawa pa (They are still manufacturing the supply for us),"" he said.
Galvez earlier said the government will sign a supply deal for 20 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from British drug group AstraZeneca.

The government has also secured 30 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from the Serum Institute of India, and 25 million doses from Sinovac Biotech.The Philippines will also get 30 million doses from COVAX Facility, a global initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to the vaccines for poor nations, said Galvez.Authorities are also negotiating for vaccine deals with drug groups Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, he said.Some 13 million Filipinos are also set to get COVID-19 vaccines from the private sector and local governments, most of which have already signed agreements with AstraZeneca.

According to Duterte, the Davao Regional Medical Center in Davao del Norte is the go-to hospital of almost all patients from the Davao Region, and even neighboring provinces outside the region.
""Now itong Davao Regional Medical Center, it caters to Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, Davao Occidental, the ComValley, which is now known Davao de Oro, and it caters some people from itong boundary ng Cotabato na mas malayo ang Cotabato City to Davao City so dito na sila,"" Duterte said during his weekly public briefing.
(Now this Davao Regional Medical Center, it caters to Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, Davao Occidental, the ComValley, which is now known Davao de Oro, and it caters to some people from the boundary of Cotabato who lives nearer to Davao City than to Cotabato City so they go to the hospital here.)
""Malaki ho ang Davao, it used to be the biggest city. Until now, Davao City is the biggest city in the world, I think, hanggang ngayon, and the population is, it's the melting pot of Region 11,"" he added.
(Davao is big, it used to be the biggest city. Until Now, Davao City is the biggest city in the world, I think, until today, and the population is, it's the melting pot.)
Duterte also boasted that Davao City is so big that one wouldn't be able to travel from its southernmost part to its northernmost part in one day.
""The Davao Region is not only Davao City but Davao City is as big as a province, that's why it's called the biggest city in the world,"" he claimed.
""If you go to the south side, you will not be able to go to the north side by sunset. That's how big it is to travel from one place to the other,"" Duterte also claimed.
A quick Internet search showed that the land area of Davao City is around 2,444 square kilometers, which is less than half the area of Forth Worth in Dallas (5,279 square kilometers), Philadelphia (5,430 square kilometers) or Washington, D.C. - Baltimore area (5,500 square kilometers), the cities that are named as the 10th largest cities by various websites.According to Demographia's annual World Urban Areas, the largest city in the world by land area is New York City Metropolitan Area (12,093 square kilometers). By population, Tokyo is considered the biggest with 37.9 million residents, according to the United Nations 2018 estimates.The Philippines on Sunday received its first vaccine supply, courtesy of China's donation of 600,000 shots from Beijing-based drug maker Sinovac Biotech. The government will transport some of these doses to Cebu on March 3, and Davao on March 5, said Galvez.The country started its vaccination program with jabs from Beijing-based drug maker Sinovac Biotech on Monday, in hopes of an immediate return to normalcy as the country races to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19).FAST FACTS: The COVID-19 vaccination rollout in the Philippines

MANILA — President Rodrigo Duterte is getting impatient over delays in the supposed arrival this month of the country's first COVID-19 vaccines, Malacañang said on Friday, as the Philippines trailed some of its regional neighbors that have launched their inoculation drive.""Tatapatin ko kayo: si Presidente ang nagsalita na. Siya mismo naiinip na,"" said Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque.(I will be direct with you, the President has spoken. He is growing impatient.)
""Kinakailangan dumating na ang mga bakuna kaya naman siguro dahil nagsalita na ng ganyan ang Presidente, e gagalaw na nang mas mabilis ang lahat,"" he said in a televised interview.
(The vaccines need to arrive. Now that the President has spoken, everyone will move faster.)
The Philippines is negotiating supply agreements with seven manufacturers for 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, so it can inoculate 70 million adults, or two-thirds of its more than 108 million population.
Vaccine manufacturers want protection from future product liability claims before they deliver the shots, authorities have said.

Carlito Galvez, a former general in charge of the country's COVID-19 vaccinations strategy, has said the absence of an indemnification program has delayed delivery of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech shots through the vaccine-sharing COVAX Facility.
The government had planned to use those, which were due to arrive in mid-February, to kick off its vaccination campaign.

MANILA — The Zuellig Pharma Corporation on Tuesday said that it was increasing its cold chain capacity to handle more coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines for the country.
“We have ordered 10 additional ultra-low freezers, on top of the 14 already deployed through our network in anticipation of the storage and distribution demands of COVID-19 vaccines in the Philippines,” said Jannette Jakosalem, Zuellig's chief business officer.
Government officials earlier inspected cold chain facilities to be used to store COVID-19 vaccines, including those from Zuellig.
Distribution of vaccines around the country depends on the cold storage capacity for various COVID-19 vaccines with different temperature requirements.

Zuellig Pharma's chief executive and area director Maikel Kuijpers said the company would continue to work with the government to address the COVID-19 crisis.
“Zuellig Pharma has played an active role during the pandemic by undertaking urgent deliveries of influenza (flu) vaccines as well as conducting mass flu vaccination exercises. We are honored and excited to engage with the Philippine government to explore ways in which we can support measures to address this current crisis and help execute the national COVID-19 vaccination program,” Kuijpers said.
“Over our long history of supplying health care products during crises such as world wars, economic crises or natural disasters, we have learned best practices that we believe are applicable to the current COVID-19 pandemic, which I hope we can share,” he added.
The company's nationwide cold rooms, with temperatures of 2° to 8° Celsius, are located across various warehouses in Santa Rosa, Laguna, Sun Valley in Parañaque, Cebu and Davao, and can store up to 629 million vaccine doses, it said.
It also has walk-in freezers that can store up to 52 million doses at -15° to -25° Celsius. They are also increasing its ultra-cold freezer capacity to 24 freezers that can store over 7 million doses at temperatures of as low as -70° to -80° Celsius, and can further ramp up this capacity if needed.
Kuijpers noted about its COVID-19 digital care platform, eZVax, developed in partnership with Accenture and Microsoft, could serve as a centralized hub coordinating and linking both stakeholders and processes through the whole mass vaccination program.
""eZVax allows checking of eligibility, pre-screening, and scheduling of vaccination of patients including date, time, and location. It has administration support with recording of patient and vaccine details, scheduling of second dose when necessary, and generation of digital health passport or vaccination card. The platform will also generate centralised adverse event reporting,"" he said.
“Our system features powerful data and analytics tools that allow us to drive efficiencies through the process whilst providing real-time dashboards and status reports.”
Delivering an eventual COVID-19 vaccine to billions of people around the world will require a Herculean effort, according to industry insiders, with the biggest challenge posed by the need for cold storage and transport.

MANILA - Vaccination coverage dropped in some areas as parents now refuse to enroll their children in government-sponsored immunization programs amid a scare triggered by the Dengvaxia controversy, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Tuesday.
Immunization coverage in Central Luzon dropped to 57 percent from 87 percent, while there's an ""increasing number of parents who don't want their children to be injected with the measles vaccine"" in Davao City, Duque said at a Senate hearing on the halted dengue vaccination program.
""One of the most common reasons for refusal is the Dengvaxia has tainted the other innocent vaccines. Even for the benign deworming activity, where they will just swallow tablets, there [has] been palpable refusal from a lot of parents,"" Duque said.
In December, the Department of Health had to stop its dengue immunization program and pull out dengue vaccine Dengvaxia from the market after French drug maker Sanofi Pasteur admitted that the drug can cause ""severe dengue"" when given to children who had never contracted the mosquito-borne disease.

A study group from the University of the Philippines- Philippine General Hospital that examined the deaths of 14 children vaccinated with Dengvaxia said more research must be conducted to establish that the deaths were due to the dengue vaccine.
""Sa dami ng nabakunahan ng Dengvaxia, mayroong normal diseases na mangyayari with or without Dengvaxia. Out of the 14, mayroon dalawang (namatay) dahil sa leukemia,"" Dr. Juliet Sio Aguilar, who headed the expert panel that conducted the study, told senators.

Duque said some groups are intentionally spreading wrong information to instigate fear of other government vaccination programs.
""Certainly, there's an effort to create this hysteria or fear if not panic among parents... This is fanned unnecessarily by systemics that come from certain quarters,"" the official said.
The Health chief did not mention which group was responsible for the supposed disinformation.

Local governments and private companies should ""at least authorize to be able to negotiate,"" Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said during the Senate Committee of the Whole investigation on COVID-19 vaccines.

""Kailangan may pera ako niyan kasi bili kaagad tayo,"" he said in a briefing after he returned to Malacañang following a 3-day trip to his hometown Davao City.
The President said scientists around the world are working at breakneck speed to develop a cure against the illness, caused by the novel coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2.
""Many countries are on the verge of, malapit na sila sa vaccine, naghahabulan. Judging from the time COVID started up to now, I'm sure that they have made a lot of progress in finding the vaccine. Nakahanap na sila,"" he said.
Duterte cited US biotech firm Moderna whose first clinical tests of an experimental vaccine against COVID-19 showed promising results.
""Meron na silang tests na showing positive results. Meron nang vaccine but ang problema, it will be ready according to them by 2021 pa. January at the very, at the earliest,"" he said.
Duterte added in jest, ""So kung gano'n, huwag ka sanang mamatay hanggang January. Hintayin mo 'yong vaccine. 'Pag tinawag ka ng kamatayan, sasabihin mo, p***** *** ka, umalis ka diyan. May hinihintay ako na vaccine. Hindi ko pa panahon mamatay.""

The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company had said the vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, appeared to produce an immune response in 8 people who received it similar to that seen in people convalescing from the virus.
Moderna chief executive Stephane Bancel said the preliminary tests inspired confidence that mRNA-1273 has ""a high probability to provide protection"" against the virus.
Separate tests performed on mice showed that the vaccine prevented the virus from replicating in their lungs, according to the company.

“We encourage every member of the AFP to take part in this vaccination program. This is not only meant to protect us from the virus but also to encourage everyone, especially those who are still undecided to be inoculated,” Sobejana was quoted as saying.
Three military health officers who received the first shots during the vaccine drive said they did not experience any adverse effects.“Those who engage in health-related works are being prioritized by the Command based on the guidelines set forth by [Department of Health] to put health workers on top of the inoculation priority list followed by senior citizens, low-income individuals, and then military personnel,” the military explained.Lorenzana said more vaccines are expected to arrive in the country “in the next couple of weeks.”The Western Mindanao Command (WesMinCom) also started its vaccination drive on Tuesday at their gymnasium, with a military medical personnel getting the first dose.Lt.

MANILA — The Philippines is in talks to join a Beijing-based biotech firm's human trial for a potential coronavirus vaccine, the Department of Science and Technology said Thursday, as the world raced to find a cure to stop the contagion in its tracks.An inter-agency task force approved negotiations to collaborate for the vaccine trial of 4 Chinese groups and a UK firm. Further studies revealed that the out of the 5, the most advance trial is that of Sinovac Biotech, said DOST Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña.Nasdaq-listed Sinovac said in April that its novel coronavirus vaccine ""largely protected"" monkeys from infection during an animal trial.The vaccine, like most others, uses a chemically inactivated novel coronavirus pathogen to help the body build immunity against the real disease. It must complete 3 phases of trial for the drug to be approved for use.The Philippines is negotiating for a local firm to get license to manufacture the drug if it joins the clinical trials and these succeed, said Dela Peña.""Iyan ay isang paraan din para masanay na ang Filipino companies sa vaccine,"" he told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.(That is a way to train Filipino companies on vaccine.)""Sasali tayo sa tinatawag na phase 2 and 3, most likely phase 3... Iyong maramihan nang trial, libo na ito ang kailangang volunteers,"" he added.(We will join the phase 2 and 3, most likely phase 3, the mass trial that needs about a thousand volunteers.)
Phase 3 testing of the vaccine will need human volunteers who were never infected with the disease as well as those with symptoms. Sinovac is looking abroad for test subjects because China now does not have enough reported COVID-19 cases, said spokeswoman Yang Guang.Joining the trial will let the Philippines get shots of the vaccine and expedite the approval of its use locally, said Dela Peña.'Don't waste a minute': Chinese firm readies mass vaccine production
Sinovac said it was ready to make 100 million doses per year to combat the virus, which surfaced in central China late last year before spreading across the globe and killing more than 400,000 people.
Thousands of shots of the vaccine have already been produced and packaged in a white and orange case emblazoned with the name ""Coronavac"".
While the drug has a long way to go before it is approved, the company must show that it can produce it on a large scale and submit batches to be controlled by the authorities.

During the health department’s town hall meeting on the COVID-19 vaccine deployment plan, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said while everyone has the choice to freely choose their COVID-19 vaccines, the country is still under a state of public health emergency.
“Ang napag-usapan, kung kayo po ay tatanggi, we will have to put you at the bottom of the list and we will give it to the next person in line as part of our priority. Hindi po natin ipipilit, very simple consent actually kaya nga lang po, mawawala ang chance niyo,” Vergeire explained, noting that the DOH understands the reason why Filipinos want to choose their vaccines.
“You would go to the bottom of the line and the next time na puwede na kayo uli magpabakuna ay yan po kapag pagdating ng susunod ng delivery at kapag tapos na po ang sektor na kabilang po kayo,” she added.
(If you refuse to be vaccinated… We will not force you. That’s very simple, but you will lose your chance to be vaccinated. You could only be vaccinated once the next batch of deliveries arrive and after your sector.)
Vergeire’s statement came as criticism mounted over the government’s suggestion to the public to just accept whatever vaccine brand is available during the inoculation drive.
The health official also said Filipinos who will refuse inoculation cannot demand to be included on the priority list if the next batch of vaccines is delivered in the country.
“Kaya lang hindi po namin kayo puwede ilagay na… dumating yung another vaccine, kayo na ang priority, hindi po, hindi po ganun ang mangyayari. Uunahin natin yung iba pa pong priority population natin,” she said.
“Hindi namin sinasabi na diretsahan na hindi ka puwede mamili kasi may informed consent naman po kayo, you will have to give us the consent kung gusto niyo yung bakuna or hindi.”
Recent surveys revealed public hesitancy to join the government's vaccination drive.
A Pulse Asia survey conducted last year showed that nearly half or 47 percent of Filipinos will not have themselves vaccinated against COVID-19 due to safety concerns.
A study by the OCTA Group released on Jan. 5, on the other hand, showed that only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents were willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19.

‘Isipin ang kapakanan ng komunidad’
Dr. Jaime Montoya, executive director of the Philippine Council for Health Research and Development, said Filipinos should think of vaccination as a means to protect oneself and others from COVID-19, which has already killed over 9,000 in the country.
“When you accept a vaccine for whatever reason, you are taking responsibility not only for yourself but for your family, the society and the country. Kapag ikaw ay tumanggap ng bakuna, hindi mo lang pinoproteksyonan ang sarili mo, ang iyong mahal sa buhay, iyong pamilya at ang bansa,” Montoya said.
(If you get vaccinated, you do not only protect yourself, but also the people around you including your loved ones and family members, eventually, the country.)
The public should also take into consideration the public health crisis, and being vaccinated against the novel coronavirus would help bring some normalcy, he said.
“Karapatan po natin yun (choosing vaccines), pero sana isipin natin na nakasalalay dito ang malaking kapakanan, hindi lang pang kapakanan ng sarili kundi kapakanan ng ating mga komunidad para tayoy bumalik na to some degree of normalcy.”
(It is our right to choose but we have to think about the welfare of others aside from ourselves. This would at least help our communities to attain some degree of normalcy.)
The Philippines has secured 25 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech, and 30 million doses from the Serum Institute of India.

Mabilis at marami agad sapagkat ito ang makapagbibigay sa atin in the long run ng proteksiyon,” Dr. Maria Consorcia Quizon, a member of the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) for COVID-19 vaccines, said in an interview on TeleRadyo.(The most important thing that experts say is to be expedient, to speed up vaccinating many people because this will provide us protection in the long run.)

The Philippines on Monday began its vaccination program, inoculating mostly health workers using jabs donated by China’s Sinovac Biotech. A shipment of AstraZeneca vaccines, meanwhile, arrived in the Philippines on Thursday through the vaccine-sharing platform COVAX Facility.“That is what we have at the moment. Kahit lumitaw na sa Pilipinas ay may variant, ang mas nakakarami pa rin ay 'yung naunang COVID so makakaprotekta pa rin sa atin,"" she said.
(This is what we have at the moment. Even if there is a presence of a variant in the Philippines, majority is the first COVID so the vaccines can still protect us.)
Quizon said vaccine brands being rolled out around the world help protect patients and their communities from COVID-19, regardless of its efficacy rate.
None of the vaccines can say that its efficacy is 100 percent, she added, and brands whose rating is not that high can still be protective.The OCTA Research Group earlier said that the efficacy of the AstraZeneca vaccine decreases from 70 percent to 10 percent in cases of the South African COVID-19 variant.
AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine may be ‘ineffective’ if PH fails to contain South African variant: expert
There is no vaccine that currently addresses this particular variant and the other mutations. Quizon said the vaccines that have been developed by various firms around the world were intended to address the first strain.
She emphasized that COVID-19 vaccines provide protection against the disease developing into a more severe form, helping prevent death.“Wala pa talagang makakapagsabi na one is better than the other,” she said.“Sa vaccines na meron tayo good for naunang coronavirus kaya di natin masabi kung talagang totally effective itong version na ito for that variant. Pero inaasahan natin na sooner or later magdadagdag sila o magte-tweak sila ng vaccine na 'yun para matugunan din o malabanan din itong variant na ito.”

He also reported 31 newly-reported cases of the UK variant. PH logs 52 more cases of S. African COVID-19 variant, 42 other mutations

The 75-year-old Duterte, who has underlying health issues, belongs to the groups vulnerable of developing severe symptoms of the respiratory disease.Photos from the vaccination drives of other countries showed that people typically received the jabs on their upper arm.Other world leaders like US President Joe Biden, Indonesian Pres. Joko Widodo, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong got vaccinated in public.Duterte is ""extremely popular,"" said public health expert Dr. Tony Leachon, a former adviser of a government task force against COVID-19.
""If he would be able to show to the public his inoculation with whatever vaccine he chooses, I'm certain vaccine hesitancy rate will go up,"" Leachon told ABS-CBN News.""Sobrang popular ni Pangulo, so makakatulong sana to boost ‘yung confidence ng ating mga kababayan kung makita siya [magpabakuna],"" Vice President Leni Robredo earlier said.(The President is very popular, so it will help boost the confidence of our compatriots if they see him being vaccinated.)

“I call on parents and caregivers of children below five years old to bring them to the nearest health center for vaccination against polio. This Saturday and Sunday, fixed vaccination posts in communities will be open and our roving teams will continue to look for unvaccinated children,” he said.
Duque said children should get vaccinated even if they had prior immunization, stressing that full vaccination is the “best way” to prevent the transmission of the disease.
ALAMIN: Libreng oral polio vaccine, kailangan pa rin ba kahit may injection na ang bata?
The synchronized polio vaccination campaign started last Oct. 14 in Lanao del Sur, Marawi City, Davao del Sur, Davao City, and Metro Manila. It will run until Oct. 27.
The campaign will be expanded to the whole of Mindanao on Nov. 25 and will conclude with another round in January 2020.
For areas excluded from the campaign, parents may still bring their children to local health facilities to get vaccinated, according to Duque.
The DOH in September confirmed the reemergence of polio in the Philippines, 19 years after the World Health Organization declared the country polio-free.Polio is a highly contagious disease caused when the polio virus invades the nervous system.
Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiff neck and sudden onset of floppy arms or legs. Severe polio cases can also lead to permanent paralysis or even death.Aside from immunization, the DOH also recommended the practice of proper hygiene to prevent the disease’s transmission.

MANILA — Half of the 10,000 COVID-19 vaccines that will be received by the Presidential Security Group through a compassionate special permit (CSP) will be given to the wives and close contacts of the soldiers, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.Asked why the PSG was allowed to receive as donation as much as 10,000 doses, FDA Director General Eric Domingo said there are 2,000 members of the PSG who are guarding President Rodrigo Duterte while in Malacañang, Davao and “everywhere he goes.”
“’Yung kalahati for the actual PSG members and the other half would be for close contacts of the PSG members meaning, of course, ’yung asawa. Syempre ’pag pag-uwi nya sa bahay ’yun ’yung kasama n’ya. So they included that,” Domingo told reporters during a video call.
(Half of that for actual PSG members and the other half would be for close contacts of the PSG members meaning, of course, the wives. Of course, when they go home they are with their wives so they included that.)
He said the 10,000 doses are enough for 5,000 people.
READ: PSG gets go signal to use COVID-19 shots months after some members got unauthorized jabs
Because the FDA does not guarantee the safety of vaccines under CSP, he said the PSG hospital is responsible for those who will receive the jabs.
Even the close contacts will receive the vaccines through the PSG Hospital.
Domingo said he specifically instructed the hospital, which requested for the compassionate special permit on January 18, to make a monthly report of those who received the vaccines. He said the report should detail any adverse event or side effect experienced by the vaccine recipients.
“Ang sabi ko sa kanila ’wag antaying maubos ang bakuna kundi buwan buwan magreport sa atin,” he said.
(I told them not to wait for the vaccine to run out but instead report monthly to us.)
Asked why the PSG did not wait for the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines vetted by the FDA since there are already two brands with emergency use authorization, Domingo said: “I cannot answer that for the PSG.”
However, he said it might be because under the priority sector groupings, the PSG will have to wait awhile before they are vaccinated through the national immunization program.“Kaya siguro sila naka-secure ng donation para hindi na makapila, makabawas sa pila. ’Yun lang ang aking opinion on it,” he said, adding that he also does not know why the PSG chose Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company, in particular.
(That’s probably why they secured a donation so they don’t have to fall in line, to not add to the queue. That’s just my opinion on it.)
Domingo said a compassionate special permit is regularly given to specialty groups and hospitals to allow the use of experimental drugs for particular individuals.
He said the PSG explained that it needed the vaccines because its members’ job is to protect the president.“And, of course, as part of the personal security of the president hindi naman sila nakakasunod sa social distancing protocols,” Domingo said. “And since we know that the health of the president is a national security issue we don’t want him getting sick and those around him hindi dapat magkasakit we decided to grant the special permit for the PSG.”
(And of course as part of the personal security of the President they cannot observe social distancing protocols…And since we know that the health of the president is a national security issue we don’t want him getting sick and those around him can’t get sick, we decided to grant the special permit for the PSG.)
Last year, the PSG said a handful of PSG personnel were already vaccinated despite the Philippines not yet having an approved COVID-19 vaccine.READ: Duterte orders PSG to 'shut up' on smuggled vaccine if called in Congress
Domingo said the granting of the CSP for Sinopharm will not affect the investigation on the said unauthorized vaccination since it will only be applied for the future use of the COVID-19 vaccines.",abscbn

In a statement, the Department of Health (DOH) said the girl's samples were sent to the government's Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Japan, and came out positive for the virus.
The DOH said it is coordinating with the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao's Ministry of Health to ""maximize immunization coverage and intensify polio vaccination efforts in Basilan.""
Duque urged parents to avail of the free polio vaccine given by the government in health centers.
During a previous immunization drive from Oct. 14 to 27, the DOH covered 96 percent of its target in Metro Manila, 92 percent in Davao del Sur, and 85 percent in Lanao del Sur.
Last September, the DOH confirmed the return of polio in the Philippines 19 years after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the country free from the disease.
Polio is a ""highly infectious viral disease, which mainly affects young children,"" according to the WHO. Severe polio cases may cause paralysis and death.
Children are recommended to receive 3 OPV doses and one shot of inactivated polio vaccine to be fully protected from the disease.

MANILA (UPDATE) - President Rodrigo Duterte might be immunized with a Russian COVID-19 vaccine by May of next year at the earliest, Malacañang said Thursday as the Philippines gears up for its clinical trial beginning this year.
The 75-year-old Duterte, who volunteered to be among the first to be inoculated in public, might be immunized with the Russian vaccine by May 1, 2021, if the drug is proven safe and effective by March next year, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said.
""Inaasahan natin na pupwedeng magpabakuna ang ating Presidente dito po sa Russian na bakuna sa Mayo 1, 2021,"" Roque said.
(We expect that the President can be immunized with the Russian vaccine by May 1, 2021.)
""It's not a metaphorical statement. He's willing to undergo it,"" he added.
Duterte, however, would need the approval of the Presidential Security Group before he gets the vaccine shot.
Presidential Security Group commander Col. Jesus Durante said Wednesday they would allow Duterte to be immunized as long as the vaccine gets approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Department of Health.
The Philippines and Russia are planning to run phase 3 clinical trials of Moscow's coronavirus vaccine from October this year to March next year, Roque said, noting that the drug might be registered with the local FDA by April next year.
Phase 3 clinical trials, according to the website of the FDA, involve ""300 to 3,000 volunteers who have the disease or condition.""
It is meant to test the efficacy and monitoring of adverse reactions of the drug.

""Pre-qualification of any vaccine includes the rigorous review and assessment of all the required safety and efficacy data,"" he said.
In Berlin, a spokesman for the German health ministry told newspaper group RND that ""there is no known data on the quality, efficacy and safety of the Russian vaccine,"" adding that ""patient safety is of the highest priority.""

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte is facing a ""dilemma"" on coronavirus vaccine clinical trials, Malacañang said Tuesday after the chief executive volunteered to be immunized with Russia's newly developed drug.
Duterte on Monday night welcomed Moscow's offer to supply Manila with COVID-19 vaccines, saying he would volunteer to be inoculated in public to show that the drug from Russia is safe.
The President made the statement weeks after he said that the Philippines' first COVID-19 vaccine might come from China. Russia has just announced that the first COVID-19 vaccine is ready for registration in just a few days.
""Ang dilemma ni Presidente noong sinabi niya na siya 'yung mangunguna na kumuha ng vaccine, ang tanong niya: kung magpa-vaccine ako sa Russia, puwede pa ba ako magpa-vaccine sa China? Puwede pa ba ako magpa-vaccine sa England at sa Amerika?"" Duterte's spokesperson Harry Roque said in a Palace press briefing.
(The President's dilemma when he volunteered to be the first to try the vaccine is: If I get vaccinated under Russia's program, can I still try the one from China? Can I still try the one from England and America?)
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, according to Roque, told the President he might not be able to do so.

The 75-year-old Philippine leader, according to Roque, is willing to risk his life with the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials to ensure its safety for the Filipino public.

MANILA - The Philippines' vaccine czar on Tuesday said the country’s supply of vaccines from British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca are not affected by issues of the European Union.President Rodrigo Duterte had accused the EU of holding up exports of COVID-19 vaccines to other countries, particularly from AstraZeneca, after the bloc announced that it was placing export controls of COVID-19 vaccines to protect its own supplies.

Vaccine czar and National Task Force on COVID-19 chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. noted that the Philippines would not have a problem in securing supplies of AstraZeneca vaccines, as the jabs would be manufactured in Thailand.

“'Yun po ang realidad na talagang sa ngayon, nakikita natin na may pulitika ang EU at UK, considering nakita natin na
ang British government is needing the vaccine very much because of the UK variant,” Galvez said on Tuesday's public briefing.
(That's the reality, that currently, we see there's politics in EU and UK, and that the British government also needs the vaccine very much because of the UK variant.)
“Nakita natin na sila they are haggling for supply, pero sa atin po, wala pong problema dahil ang ating suplay ay galing sa plant ng Thailand at saka mayroon tayong another plant sa Serum Institute of India na pwede tayong magkaroon ng tie-up. And possibly, dun po ma-resolve 'yung logistical requirement po natin,” he said.
(We know that they are haggling for supply, but for us, we don't have a problem since our supply will be coming from Thailand and another plant at the Serum Institute of India, which can have a tie-up. And possibly, the logistical requirement may be resolved there.)
Galvez said the NTF is even set to conduct a virtual inspection of AstraZeneca’s manufacturing plant in Thailand on Wednesday.
The drugmaker said last week it would fall short of delivering promised vaccines to the EU, igniting a backlash from the bloc.
The EU is now looking into a scheme to monitor and authorize export of vaccines, potentially blocking them if its own supply is not met.

MANILA — The public should wait for a formal assessment by Filipino experts before speculating on news reports that the COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech is just 50 percent effective, an official leading the immunization effort said on Wednesday.
Sinovac's vaccine was just 50.4 percent effective at preventing symptomatic infections in a Brazilian trial, researchers said on Tuesday, barely enough for regulatory approval.

The Philippines has secured 25 million jabs of the Sinovac vaccine, the first 50,000 doses of which will arrive in the country in February, Malacañang had said.
In China, Sinovac's emergency use is authorized for the elderly and people who are at risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms, said Galvez, a former military general who is also the country's inoculation czar.

A suspected case of acute flaccid paralysis is also awaiting confirmation, it added.
""A single confirmed polio case of vaccine-derived polio virus type 2 or two positive environmental samples that are genetically linked isolated in two different locations is considered an epidemic in a polio-free country,"" the agency said.
The DOH said there is ""no cure for polio"" and that ""it can only be prevented with multiple doses of polio vaccines that have long been proven safe and effective.""
Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier warned that the country was at ""high risk for poliovirus transmission"" as there had been a drop in oral polio vaccine (OPV) coverage in the past years.Amid Dengvaxia scare: Vaccination coverage drops 30 pct in some areas, says Duque
“In 2018, the vaccine coverage for the third dose of OPV was 66 percent. This figure is below the 95 percent target required to ensure that the whole population is protected against polio,” he said.
The decrease in polio immunization was traced back to the vaccine scare linked to the controversy over anti-dengue virus Dengvaxia, said to have ill effects if given to those who have not had dengue.
The DOH urged parents to have their children, especially those under the age of 5, to be vaccinated at the synchronized oral polio immunization program it would launch next month.
""It is the only way to stop the polio outbreak and to protect your child against this paralyzing disease,"" it said.
""Aside from immunization, we remind the public to practice good personal hygiene, wash their hands regularly, use toilets, drink safe water, and cook food thoroughly.""

MANILA — The Philippines’ total COVID-19 cases jumped to 427,797 on Saturday after the Department of Health (DOH) reported 1,893 new cases, a day after the country, with the help of private companies, inked the first vaccine deal to address the pandemic.
This is the 19th straight day that the daily tally did not exceed 2,000, but it does not include data from 11 laboratories that failed to submit results to the COVID-19 Data Repository System on Friday.
Davao City led areas in the country with the most number of new infections after logging 200 additional cases, followed by Negros Occidental with 123, Samar (Western Samar) with 84, province of Pampanga with 60, and Quezon City with 57.
Davao City has been among the areas being monitored by the government due to the continued rise in COVID-19 cases and high hospital occupancy.
The number of recovered patients increased to 388,062 as the DOH logged 474 more recoveries. The total recoveries account for 90.7 percent of the total recorded cases.
The virus, which first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, has claimed 79 more lives. The death toll stood at 8,333.
A total of 31,402 or 7.3 percent of the total number of cases are considered active infections. The health department said 93 percent of patients currently ill are asymptomatic or exhibiting mild symptoms, while 4.4 percent are critically ill.
Of the 27,748 people who were tested as of Friday noon, 1,553 or 5.6 percent were confirmed positive for the disease, data showed.
A total of 14 duplicates were removed from the total tally, said the DOH. Of these, 10 were tagged as recovered cases while 1 death was removed.
A total of 18 cases initially tagged as recoveries were also found to be deaths after validation.

More than 61.6 million people globally have contracted COVID-19, according to a running tally from US-based Johns Hopkins University, with the US, India, Brazil, France and Russia having the highest number of cumulative cases.
Since the pandemic began, over 1.4 million people have died while 39.4 million have recovered.

MANILA — The COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac will be the sole option for inoculation among Filipinos until the middle of the year, Malacañang said on Tuesday.The first batch of the Sinovac vaccine will arrive in the Philippines in February, while doses from Western drug makers will only be available by June.
""Pagdating po ng bakuna hanggang Hunyo, wala po talagang pilian 'yan dahil iisa lang po ang bakuna na magiging available. Iyon nga po iyong galing sa Tsina,"" Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque told reporters in an online briefing.
(When the vaccine arrives until June, there will really be no choice because only one vaccine will be available. That's the one from China.)

However, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said earlier Tuesday that the Pfizer vaccine might arrive earlier than Sinovac because its rollout would be supervised by the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that aims to ensure equitable access to the drug.
All vaccines that the local Food and Drug Administration will authorize for emergency use would have ""equal footing,"" said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.
""Ito po ay magiging ligtas saka magiging epektibo para sa ating mga kababayan,"" she said in Roque's briefing.(This will be safe and effective for our compatriots.)
""Hindi po natin kailangan na mamili po tayo ng bakuna. Kung ano po iyong mauunang bakuna, atin pong tanggapin iyan,"" Vergeire said.

MANILA - Theoretically, it should work.
A health expert has this to say following an announcement from Malacañang that President Rodrigo Duterte will take COVID-19 shots in the rear.
""Any muscle should be fine. Any big muscle. Whether it's the arm or the butt, it should work,"" Dr. Edsel Salvaña, member of the technical advisory group that advises the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), told ANC.
However, he noted that those who have been inoculated in the US got it in the arm or deltoid.
""Theoretically, you can use it on the butt. But unless there's some reason you have little muscle on the arm, the arm is fine,"" he said.
Butt shot? Duterte to get COVID-19 shots in private, Palace reiterates
Salvaña, also the director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of the Philippines - National Institutes of Health, said the vaccines were developed "" in such a way you want to put it in an area where the body can recognize them and have a good immune response.""
""There are other routes, such as subcutaneous, never intravenous, where you can ensure the body has adequate response,"" he said.
In a report published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it said that deltoid is generally used for routine intramuscular vaccine administration in adults.
""The buttocks should not be routinely used as a vaccination site for infants and children; and, to avoid injury to the sciatic nerves, they are generally not used in adults,"" it said.
The national public health institute said the central region of the buttocks should be avoided for all injections.
""The site selected should be well into the upper, outer mass of the gluteus maximus and away from the central region of the buttocks,"" it said.
In a press briefing Tuesday, presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the chief executive would get the COVID-19 jabs in private.
""Sabi nga niya dahil sa puwet siya magpapasaksak, hindi pupuwedeng public,"" he told reporters.
(He said he would get the vaccine shots on his buttocks, so it cannot be in public.)
The 75-year-old Duterte, who has underlying health issues, belongs to the groups vulnerable of developing severe symptoms of the respiratory disease.

George Calvelo, ABS-CBN NewsMANILA — The Philippines has signed an indemnity deal required to get COVID-19 vaccines from US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and United Kingdom's AstraZeneca, an official leading the inoculation effort said on Wednesday.Authorities submitted the agreement to the COVAX Facility, a global initiative that seeks to ensure equitable access to the vaccines, said Carlito Galvez Jr, chief implementer of the National Task Force against COVID-19 in a public briefing.
Under the indemnity deal, the national government will be responsible and shoulder the cost for adverse effects on those inoculated, NTF deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said.
""Nakapagpirma na po at naisumite na po natin ang mga requirements. Kasama na po dito ang indemnification agreements para sa Pfizer at AstraZeneca. Napirmahan na po namin iyon,"" he said in a public briefing.(We have signed and submitted the requirements. These include the indemnification agreements for Pfizer and AstraZeneca.

""Binibigyan po natin sila ng tinatawag na guarantee na iyong gagawin po natin na immunization ay prepared na prepared po ang Pilipinas, kaya po nating i-handle pati iyong tinatawag nating mga adverse effect,"" he added.(We are giving them a guarantee that we are very prepared for the immunization we will launch in the Philippines, that we can handle even the adverse effects.)
The processing of some documents earlier snagged the arrival of an initial batch of 117,000 Pfizer doses from the COVAX Facility this month, Dizon earlier said. He did not say if the documents include the indemnity agreement.
Such a deal is standard requirement for vaccine manufacturers, Dizon said.
""Ito po kasing mga bakunang ito ay hindi pa natatapos ang proseso ng product registration sa buong mundo,"" said Dizon.
(These vaccines have not yet completed product registration around the world.)
Most vaccines are on the third stage of clinical trials and will be used on emergency basis, he said.Vaccine makers want ""reassurance"" after French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi was sued in the Philippines over its dengue vaccine, which allegedly caused severe symptoms of the mosquito-borne disease in some recipients, said Galvez.

MANILA — Malacañang said on Monday there was ""nothing wrong"" with President Rodrigo Duterte's threat to scrap a defense deal with the United States if it fails to supply the Philippines with vaccines against the novel coronavirus.The President is the ""chief architect of our foreign policy,"" said his spokesman Harry Roque.""Hindi po natin puwedeng ipagkait sa ating Pangulo iyang ganyang desisyon,"" he said in an online press briefing.(We cannot stop the President from making that decision.)
Roque then brought up Duterte's absolute pardon in September for convicted US Marine Lance Cpl. Joseph Scott Pemberton, who killed a Filipino transgender woman in 2014 in Olongapo City, north of the capital Manila.

""Siguro, kinailangan gawin ng Presidente iyon para masigurado na tayo'y makakuha ng bakuna. Pero hindi 'ata naging sapat iyon para tayo'y mabigyan ng bakuna. Kaya, ang opinyon ko lamang, ngayon sinabi ng Presidente na pati VFA, kakanselahin niya kung hindi tayo mabigyan ng bakuna,"" Roque said.
(Perhaps the President needed to do that so we could get vaccines. But perhaps it was not enough. So, in my opinion, the President said now that he would cancel the VFA if we don't get vaccines.)
""Wala pong masama d'yan. Hindi po iyan blackmail. Iyan po ay ibig sabihin ng indipendienteng panglabas na polisya... Hindi po tayo sunod-sunuran, hindi po tayo didiktahan ng kahit sino,"" Roque added.
(There is nothing wrong with that. That is not blackmail. That is the meaning of independent foreign policy. We will not simply obey and be dictated upon by anyone.)
Duterte over the weekend said he would push through with the termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), unless Washington gives vaccines against the new coronavirus.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson said ""there could be a more diplomatic or at least a better way of asking a longtime ally to help us avail of the vaccines.""Duterte should be 'more diplomatic', not threatening US for COVID-19 vaccines: Lacson
The VFA provides the legal framework for which US troops can operate on a rotational basis in the Philippines, and experts say without it, their other bilateral defense agreements cannot be implemented.
Duterte pulled the plug on the VFA on Feb. 11 in an angry response to the revocation of a US visa held by former police chief-turned-senator Ronald Dela Rosa who led his war on drugs. The termination of the VFA was supposed to take effect in August.RELATED VIDEO

But in June, the government said it had suspended plans to cancel the VFA, which is important to Washington's moves to counter Beijing's rising regional power. The postponement of the abrogation was made anew in November.

It has a lower efficacy rate of 50.4 percent when used on health care workers exposed to COVID-19, he added.

This came 5 days after President Rodrigo Duterte revealed that soldiers have already been vaccinated, and the Presidential Security Group announced its members took the vaccines to protect the President.
“General Gilbert Gapay has ordered the conduct of a through investigation on the factual circumstances surrounding this incident,” said the statement, referring to the Armed Forces Chief of Staff.
READ: COVID-19 vaccines used by PSG were 'smuggled', says defense chief
In the government’s vaccination priority list, the military is only the fifth recipient, after frontline health workers, senior citizens, and poor communities.
Moreover, receiving an unlicensed vaccine could well be a violation of the law.
Republic Act 9711 states that “the manufacture, importation, exportation, sale, offering for sale, distribution, transfer, non-consumer use, promotion, advertising, or sponsorship of any health product that is adulterated, unregistered or misbranded” is prohibited, and violators may face anywhere from 1 to 10 years in jail.
Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana himself has described the vaccines as “smuggled.”
Prior to announcing the launch of an investigation, the AFP defended the PSG’s position on the matter several times, and has maintained the same stance.
“We stand by the previous statement of PSG Commander (Brig. Gen.) Jesus Durante that the President’s close-in security had themselves inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine to greatly reduce the possibility of being the source and carrier of this virus and consequently infect the President, whose good health and well-being are the PSG's primordial concern,” it said.
Government to this day has remained mum about the source of the vaccine. In describing the vaccination, Duterte named SinoPharm, a vaccine developed by a state-owned pharmaceutical company in China.
The AFP has distanced the AFP chief from the issue, saying: “We maintain our previous declaration that the Chief-of-Staff of the AFP was not part of or privy about the circumstances involving the procurement of these vaccines, its source, and the administration thereof to PSG troopers.”
Sinopharm does not have regulatory approval yet to distribute or administer vaccines in the Philippines.
Dr. Tony Leachon, former adviser of the government's pandemic task force, cited that it could set a bad precedent in the government's massive vaccination program next year.
""First, it's a violation of FDA (Food and Drug Administration) rules in terms of trying to bring in unregistered products even as donation,"" said Leachon.
""No. 2, it could actually sabotage the national vaccination program considering there's a grand plan for this one,"" he told ANC's ""Matters of Fact.""",abscbn

This as laboratories across the globe scrambled to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, which has sickened 5.2 million people worldwide and killed more than 338,000 since it first emerged from the Chinese city of Wuhan in December.In its Resolution No. 39 dated May 22, 2020, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases approved the participation of the Philippines in clinical trials of four collaborating organizations.These are the following: Adimmune Corporation (Taiwan)Academia Sinica (Taiwan)Chinese Academy of Science - Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health (China)SinoPharma- Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and Beijing Institute (China)
According to the IATF, the organizations will be provided with requirements for COVID-19 vaccine target product profiles from the World Health Organization; pre-qualification process for WHO approvals; and the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) updated guidelines on clinical trials.
""Pursuant to the foregoing, the FDA is directed to advise on the process to facilitate the issuance of permit for the conduct of clinical trial in the Philippines,"" the IATF said.
It said that researchers involved in the clinical trials will ""identify together"" study sites. Once clinical trials are finished, these will form part of the requirements for the vaccine registration process by the FDA for issuance of the certificate of product registration for marker release in the country.
A DOST-led sub-technical working group was also formed and directed to coordinate with the WHO, the Department of Health, FDA, and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine ""for matters relating to such clinical trials.""
The IATF also said it supports the DOST's plans to establish research centers that can ""initiate and strengthen"" vaccine development in the Philippines.The plans include the establishment of a virology institute in New Clark City, Tarlac and the reactivation of the Pharmaceutical Development Unit at DOST's Industrial Technology and Development Institute as the Tuklas Lunas Center for Pharmaceuticals Development.
The resolution was signed by IATF chairperson and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and IATF co-chair Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles.
The Philippines earlier started its participation in the World Health Organization’s clinical trials, which involves the testing of off-label drugs that have shown some evidence of effectivity against COVID-19.
As of May 16, more than 100 COVID-19 patients in Metro Manila and Davao City have been enrolled in the WHO's Solidarity Trial, according to Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.

Companies must have a 2021 business permit and must be up-to-date with their tax payments, including those paying in installments, to get free vaccine, Binay said.
Firms that have purchased vaccines for their employees will no longer be included, she added.
""Getting vaccinated is our best hope of fighting the coronavirus. It is a chance to regain mobility, and jumpstart the economy. We do not have to live in fear of infecting our families and loved ones each time we come home from work,” she said in a statement.
“We will use the number of employees declared by the businesses in their business permit applications as basis for the number of employees who will be vaccinated for free. This is our way of helping our economic frontliners.""
Makati has allotted P1 billion for the purchase of COVID-19 vaccines and has so far secured 1 million doses of AstraZeneca's product.
The first batch of the COVID-19 vaccines will arrive in February and will immediately be administered to the city’s frontliners while the rest of the inoculation will arrive by the third quarter, Binay said.
“Makati is 100 percent ready. Our logistics and pre-vaccination and post-vaccination monitoring systems are in place. We are just waiting for the vaccines to arrive. The challenge for now is convincing people to get vaccinated,"" she said.
""We have to improve our information dissemination drives and make people understand that the vaccines are good, they are safe, and they will be well taken care of — no matter what.""
The city will cover medical expenses and hospital bills of those who experience any adverse effects linked to the vaccine, Binay said.
“For non-residents, it will be covered by PhilHealth and the ‘Malasakit Financial Assistance’ from the Department of Health. In Makati, our #ProudMakatizens will get free medical and health assistance through our Yellow Card program,” she said.
Local governments earlier set aside funds for procurement of vaccines in a bid to augment national government's supply as it aims to inoculate 70 million people against the new coronavirus to achieve herd immunity.

But Lim said that China, which has a population of more than 1.3 billion, will likely prioritize its citizens before giving the vaccine to other countries.“Uunahin nila yung citizens nila,” Lim said in an interview with Teleradyo.
The MAP official added that the Philippines should look at other countries’ efforts to develop a vaccine.
“We should not put our eggs in one basket, so to speak.”Lim also said that while he understands the need to put Metro Manila back under modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) because of the surge in COVID-19 cases, he hopes that the country will not be forced to go back to the even stricter ECQ.He said that under the MECQ that will be in effect until Aug. 18, the economy is estimated to lose around P12 billion per day.

(It is unjust to require small companies to shoulder the responsibilities of the government, especilly when they are paying for so many already.)
""Unang-una, hindi naman lahat tayo gustong magpa-vaccine… 'yung iba nga natatakot magpa-vaccine,"" he said.
(In the first place, not everyone wants to be vaccinated... There are some who are scared to get a shot.)
Micro, small and medium enterprises make up 99 percent of businesses in the country, according to data from the Department of Trade and Industry.
Health experts earlier said that at least 60 percent of the population needs to be inoculated against COVID-19 to develop herd immunity against the highly-contagious virus.
The ECOP chief urged the government to prioritize the jumpstarting of the country’s economy rather than continuously ""experimenting"" on programs adding to the already heavy burden of the people.
""Marami pa ring kompanya ang hindi makapag-decide kung magtutuloy sila o magsasara,"" he said.
(A lot of companies remain undecided if they will continue to operate or just close shop.)
""Kailangan siguro medyo bilis-bilisan natin ang recovery dahil kapag hindi… marami ang mamamatay, magugutom,"" he said.
(I think we need to speed up our recovery because if we fail to do that... A lot of people will die and will experience hunger.)
One major factor that is slowing down economic recovery according to Ortiz-Luis, is the wrong focus of the government, including the automation of payment schemes in the transport sector.
""Pinasok 'yung Beep (card), pinasok 'yung RFID… sinasabi na namin, 'yang lahat ng 'yan saka na gawin 'yan. I-mobilize muna 'yung mass transportation,"" he said.
(They implemented the Beep card, the RFID... What we are saying is that all those things should be done later. They should first mobilize mass transportation.)
""Dapat 'yan, lahat nung eksperimento na 'yan, pati 'yung modernization ng jeep na 'yan… dapat 'yan back burner 'yan. Tapusin muna 'yang COVID... Huwag nilang isabay at ikatwiran 'yung COVID para magawa 'yun,"" he said.
(All those experiments, including the jeepney modernization... should be in the back burner. Let's get past COVID first... They should not use COVID as a reason to implement those policies.)

MANILA - The initial batch of around 2.6 million doses of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine secured for private sector's use is expected to arrive by the second quarter, a presidential adviser said Friday.Sec. Joey Concepcion, founder of Go Negosyo and Presidential Adviser for Entrepreneurship, said the first batch of vaccines for 23 companies may arrive by May or June. The remaining balance will arrive around the third quarter.

(That's free but the employee can buy for his family from the company.)
He clarified that this is not mandatory as families have the option to wait for the free supply of vaccines coming from their respective local government units.Some companies may extend the free vaccines to their employees’ immediate family while others could offer it through salary deduction.
AstraZeneca, he said, is about $10 for two doses.

MANILA - The operator of the country's energy grid called on government on Wednesday to allow private companies to procure COVID-19 vaccines for employees to support the bounce-back of businesses and the economy.
Anthony Almeda, president and CEO of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), appealed to lawmakers to pass a law encouraging the private sector to provide vaccinations to its employees.
“Vaccination, as well as mass testing, is focally critical in the fight against COVID-19... We need to jumpstart the economy now, but we need to ensure that we stack the odds against infections in the workplace,” said Almeda.
He noted that a vaccination program for the private sector would provide a semblance of normal activity in businesses, leading to faster economic recovery.

MANILA — Vaccines against COVID-19 that have been approved for emergency use cannot be sold and bought commercially, the Philippines' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reminded the public Tuesday as the country prepares for the arrival in the coming days of its initial vaccine supplies.
“Bawal po 'yan at 'wag kayong bibili dahil wala pa pong produkto (COVID-19 vaccine) sa buong mundo na may marketing authorization - ibig sabihin na fully developed na na maaring ibenta sa publiko,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a Laging Handa briefing.
(That’s not allowed and you should not buy because there is still no product in the world that has a marketing authorization - meaning it has been fully developed and can be sold to the public.)

Rodriguez Memorial Hospital in Caloocan City on February 9, 2021. The screening process includes counseling for people who are undecided to take the vaccine. Jonathan Cellona, ABS-CBN News
Domingo issued the warning after the Healthcare Professionals Alliance against COVID-19 called out private companies purchasing vaccines and allegedly selling it to individuals in advance.Currently, all COVID-19 vaccines are still under development, which is why they are only given an emergency use authorization to help fight the pandemic.
Domingo said he and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III met with health workers on Monday evening to discuss the matter.
“The DOH and FDA will be coming up with a statement to be very clear na ang bakuna ay maaari lang ma-access (that vaccines can only be accessed) through the government vaccination program,” said Domingo.
While the national government is allowed to designate local government units and private companies to be part of the vaccination program, they still have to follow the guidelines of the Department of Health, he added.
“At syempre po, pinangako ni Pangulo na libre ang bakuna at hindi babayaran itong mga ito.”
(And of course, the President said the vaccine should be free and should not be paid for by Filipinos.)
Domingo said the FDA, meanwhile, is working closely with the Philippine National Police, the Bureau of Customs and the National Bureau of Investigation to make sure that fake vaccines will not enter the Philippines.
“Pag dumating ang genuine o authentic vaccines, ito rin ang time na maaring may sumabay na fake na vaccines. We have to be very very careful. Binabantayan naman po,” he said.
(When the genuine or authentic vaccines arrive, this is also the time that fake vaccines might spread. We have to be very, very careful. We’re closely monitoring it.)
He said only vaccines used in the national vaccination program are authentic and those sold outside are most likely fake.

Up to around 70 million individuals are being eyed for coverage of the vaccination program to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus.

What to know about their COVID-19 vaccines,"Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News",Dec 30 2020 10:27 PM,"MANILA — Chinese companies Sinovac and Sinopharm have been making headlines lately because of their respective COVID-19 vaccines.
And while they’re both leading Chinese vaccine makers and their names sound alike — beginning with the same Latin-derived prefix sino used to refer to China — they are different from each other.
Filipinos first heard about both companies mid-year when the government revealed that it approved collaborations with other countries for vaccine clinical trials.
READ: To acquire COVID-19 vaccine, best for Philippines to participate in clinical trials
Both have also consistently been on the top of the list of vaccine frontrunners the World Health Organization has been monitoring. As the country to be the first to detect the COVID-19 virus, China’s biopharmaceutical companies have been able to get ahead of the vaccine race.However, both Sinovac and Sinopharm have also faced controversy — Sinovac for its bribery case and Sinopharm for supposedly being illegally used by the Presidential Security Group (PSG) of President Rodrigo Duterte.
So besides that, how does one tell the two companies apart? Here’s how they’re different:
OWNERSHIP
Sinopharm or the China National Pharmaceutical Group Corp. is a state-owned enterprise in China. According to its website (reference: https://www.sinopharm.com/en/1398.html), the healthcare group has 128,000 employees and over 1,100 subsidiaries. It claims to be the world’s 6th largest vaccine manufacturer, producing all vaccines for China’s National Vaccination Program. Besides developing vaccines, it also distributes drugs and medical devices.
On the other hand, Sinovac is a private firm that has developed vaccines for influenza and hepatitis. According to a Time article (reference: https://time.com/5872081/sinovac-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-coronavac/), Sinovac was the only vaccine developer to reach Phase 1 clinical trials during the SARS outbreak in 2002 to 2003. It was that work that allowed the company to get a head start on their COVID-19 vaccine.
COVID-19 VACCINES
Both Sinopharm and Sinovac are working on vaccines using the inactivated or killed COVID-19 virus. Inactivated virus vaccines have long been used for inoculation. While other companies such as Moderna and Pfizer are using more modern technologies such as RNA vaccines, inactivated virus vaccines are tried and tested. However, it is said to be more difficult to manufacture, among other limitations.
Sinopharm has two vaccines in development, one developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and another by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products. Both the Wuhan and the Beijing vaccines use the inactivated virus cultivated in vero cells or kidney epithelial cells from the African Green Monkey.
Sinopharm announced on Wednesday that its Beijing vaccine was 79% effective.

Meanwhile, Sinovac previously said its vaccine was 50% effective, which the Department of Science and Technology said was “acceptable.”
READ: 'Acceptable' for Chinese COVID-19 vaccine to have 50-percent efficacy- DOST
Although using an inactivated virus vaccine has limitations, one benefit for developing countries is that it does not require very low temperatures for storage.
CONTROVERSY
Recently, both companies figured in controversies. Sinovac’s bribery case several years ago was mentioned in a Washington Post article.
The report revealed that Sinovac CEO admitted to paying a Chinese official to expedite the company’s vaccine certifications. The CEO argued that he could not turn down the official who asked for the bribe money.
The Philippines’ Department of Health assured Filipinos that such concerns will also be tackled by the ethics review board while the Food and Drug Administration said it will not tolerate corruption.
READ: FDA on Sinovac’s history of bribery: ‘Huwag nilang subukang manuhol’
Meanwhile, Sinopharm is said to be the vaccine used by the PSG despite the fact that no vaccine has been given regulatory approval in the Philippines.
Under the FDA law, the importation, sale and administering of unregistered vaccines should result in a penalty of a fine or imprisonment but health officials say they do not have information yet to hold anyone accountable.
LIMITED USE
Both Sinopharm and Sinovac have been approved for limited use in China. Sinopharm’s vaccines are also being used in the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain (Beijing vaccine).
PH APPLICATIONS
Currently, Sinovac is still pursuing its application for clinical trials in the Philippines. As part of the company’s Phase 3 trials, Filipinos will be able to see if the vaccine is safe and effective.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/overseas/08/05/20/scientists-are-optimistic-about-new-vaccine-studies-from-novavax,Scientists are optimistic about new vaccine studies from Novavax,"Carl Zimmer and Katie Thomas, The New York TImes",Aug 05 2020 07:29 AM,"Novavax, the little-known Maryland company that received a $1.6 billion deal from the federal government for its experimental coronavirus vaccine, announced encouraging results in two preliminary studies on Tuesday.
These scientists raced to find a COVID-19 drug. Then the virus found them.
US awards $1.6 billion to Novavax for COVID-19 vaccine
In one study, 56 volunteers produced a high level of antibodies against the virus without any dangerous side effects. In the other, researchers found that the vaccine strongly protected monkeys from coronavirus infections.
Although it’s not possible to directly compare the data from clinical trials of different coronavirus vaccines, John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine who was not involved in the studies, said the Novavax results were the most impressive he had seen so far.
“This is the first one I’m looking at and saying, ‘Yeah, I’d take that,’” Moore said.
Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University who was not involved in the studies, called them “encouraging preliminary results,” but cautioned that it won’t be possible to say whether the vaccine is safe and effective until Novavax conducts a large-scale study — known as Phase 3 — comparing people who get vaccinated to people who get a placebo.
The studies are being submitted to scientific journals to be reviewed for publication, said Dr. Gregory Glenn, the president of research and development at Novavax.
The company has said that if its vaccine is shown to be effective, it can produce 100 million doses by the beginning of next year, or enough to give to 50 million people if administered in two doses. Under its deal with the federal government, the company will also receive money to undertake large-scale manufacturing of millions more doses if the vaccine is shown to work.
Novavax’s vaccine is one of more than two dozen products to have entered the first round of safety tests in people, known as Phase 1 trials. Five other coronavirus vaccines are already in Phase 3 trials, in which thousands of people are tested to see if a vaccine works.
But Novavax, which has never brought a vaccine to market in its 33-year history, uses a formula that’s different from all the other vaccines that have produced results in humans so far.
Its vaccines contain a coronavirus protein that prompts a response from the immune system. Protein-based vaccines have a longer track record than some of the newer approaches used by competing coronavirus vaccines, such as those based on viral genes or so-called adenoviruses.
Protein-based vaccines are licensed for diseases such as hepatitis B and shingles. Novavax successfully completed a Phase 3 trial for a protein-based vaccine for influenza earlier this year and has done research on other diseases, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome.
Novavax’s technology turns moth cells into factories for a coronavirus protein called spike, which studs the surface of coronaviruses. Its vaccine combines several of the spike proteins in a nanoparticle.
To improve the performance of the vaccine, Novavax mixed the spike proteins with a compound called an adjuvant. Studies on mice had previously shown that the adjuvant stimulates immune cells so that they develop a potent response to the virus.
The researchers gave the protein and adjuvant to monkeys in different combinations of doses. The monkeys began making high levels of antibodies that could specifically block the coronavirus.
When the monkeys were infected, some versions of the vaccine left them with no trace of the vaccine in their lungs or noses.
“That’s pretty remarkable,” said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University. She noted that the Novavax vaccine provided stronger protection for monkeys than have other coronavirus vaccines, such as Moderna’s messenger RNA vaccine.
In May, Novavax started a Phase 1 human trial on 134 volunteers. Some of the people who received the vaccine experienced tenderness at the spot where they got injected. But the researchers found no serious side effects.
The researchers extracted serum from the vaccinated volunteers and mixed it with coronaviruses and cells. This showed that the volunteers produced high levels of antibodies that prevented the viruses from infecting cells. The vaccine produced more antibodies in the volunteers than in patients who had recovered from COVID-19 on their own.
“There’s no way to know yet what level leads to protection,” said Matt Frieman, a virologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and a co-author of the Phase 1 study. “But all of these pieces point to it being quite effective.”
Volunteers who only received the spike protein in their vaccine did not make a lot of antibodies, the researchers found. “The adjuvant is critical,” Glenn of Novavax said.
Moore said that the volunteers’ strong response to the vaccine “does not surprise me in the slightest.” In June, he and his Weill Cornell colleague P.J. Klasse predicted protein-based vaccines would produce a strong antibody response in a review they published in the Journal of Virology.
Although Novavax is the first company to share clinical results on the immune response of a protein vaccine, it is not the only one testing this technology. Three other protein-based vaccines for COVID-19 — from Clover Biopharmaceuticals, the University of Queensland and Vaxine — are also in Phase 1 trials.
The World Health Organization lists more than 50 protein-based coronavirus vaccines in preclinical trials. One of them is being developed by Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, a partnership that last month was granted $2.1 billion from the federal government for 100 million doses. Sanofi expects to start its Phase 1 trial next month.
Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline snag biggest coronavirus vaccine deal yet
Sanofi and Novavax both manufacture their vaccines inside the cells of the fall armyworm moth, which allows them to be produced more quickly than older methods that use mammal cells. This technique is one reason Novavax’s vaccine candidate has gotten so much attention — in addition to its deal with the U.S. government, the company has also secured up to $388 million from the nonprofit Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which seeks to make vaccines available outside of the United States. Sanofi’s Flublok vaccine, which is already on the market, uses this technology.
Immunologists have been debating the importance of antibodies for fighting the coronavirus. It’s possible that another part of the immune system, T cells, is also needed to fend off the virus. Moore speculated that the best vaccine against COVID-19 might marshal both types of responses.
A protein vaccine could provide strong antibody protection, while another vaccine — perhaps one based on messenger RNA or an adenovirus — could enlist T cells.
“If these first-generation vaccines are safe but they’re just not potent enough, then you would certainly want to look at combining them,” Moore said.",abscbn

MANILA - Procurement laws in the country and the ""tedious"" process of closing vaccine deals have slowed down the arrival of the doses in the country, COVID-19 vaccine czar Carlito Galvez on Monday said.Under the law, local government units are not allowed to directly procure vaccines from pharmaceutical companies as they must first secure ""the explicit approval of the President,"" Galvez told lawmakers during the Senate Committee of the Whole investigation on COVID-19 vaccines.
""It needs an advance of more or less 50 percent of the cost because it is an investment cost [but] they are not authorized to have the advanced market commitment,"" he said.
""Congress should pass a law authorizing for the advance market commitment of the local government,"" he said, as he answered Sen. Pia Cayetano query on why regional peers were able to procure ahead of the Philippines.
""Nauna ang Indonesia (Indonesia got it first) because Sinovac nagkaroon ng clinical trial sa Indonesia... They have the privilege of getting it first,"" Galvez said.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson said the vaccine task force should step up to speed up the process of approving vaccines in the country.
""Kung sa ease of doing business pa lang bagsak na agad,"" Lacson said.
(If we talk about the ease of doing business, we already failed.)
""'Yung incompetence, like the coronavirus, is infectious if you hang around incompetent people. Mahahawa ka (You will get infected),"" he said.
Lacson earlier blamed Health Secretary Francisco Duque III for allegedly botching the Philippines' initial deal to ship Pfizer vaccines to the country as early as January.
Galvez denied that there was a lapse with the Pfizer deal, saying some 40 million vaccines from the American pharmaceutical giant are set to arrive in the country later this year.

The facility, which was mainly used for food storage, could accommodate up to 28 million doses of the COVID19 vaccine in cold storage. George Calvelo, ABS-CBN News
MANILA - Local government units (LGUs) and private companies that have entered into tripartite agreements for procurement of COVID-19 vaccines were told to observe national government-set vaccine cold storage standards and not just resort to their own refrigeration measures.
National Task Force on COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Sec. Carlito Galvez, Jr. told senators during hearing on Friday that the the cold storage chain has to remain intact to prevent wastage of the vaccines.
“We are firming up the supply agreement with the pharmaceutical companies… so that the supply agreement will ensure that the handover of the vaccine from the airport will not break the chain of the required temperature,” Galvez said.
“Before the vaccines will be coming here, we will make sure that even the LGUs we have established it (vaccine cold storage facility) should even be accredited as pharma-grade,” he added.
Health Sec. Francisco Duque III meanwhile said his department is engaging the association of cold storage facility providers and pharma-grade third party logistics providers.
“Hindi naman po pwedeng basta-basta lang na cold storage facility, may standards po, so naka-set na po standards sa amin pong supply chain management office,” he said.
Duque said breaking the cold storage chain can result in spoiling or weakened efficacy of the vaccine.
Zuellig Pharma Philippines, a top pharma-grade logistics provider, also explained to senators that vaccines cannot be kept in just “any freezer”.
“Our recommendation is to use the pharma-grade…. it provides redundancy. You cannot afford that your freezer will lose power, you cannot afford that the vaccine is mixed with food or it will get contaminated,” Zuellig Pharma Philippines chief business officer Jannette Jakosalem said.
Certified pharma-grade cold storage facilities are checked periodically by state regulators, she added.
Several COVID-19 vaccines currently under development and pending completion of Phase-3 clinical trials have different cold storage requirements to maintain efficacy.
For example, US-based Pfizer’s vaccine needs to be stored at -70 degrees Celsius, while China's CoronaVac can be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius.RELATED VIDEO

Vergeire said AstraZeneca can now apply for regulatory approval for the distribution of their COVID-19 clinical trials with the FDA and the Health Technology Assessment Council.
Joey Concepcion, Presidential Adviser on Entrepreneurship, said Monday that the business sector is set to buy a second batch of vaccines from AstraZeneca.
Vergeire said vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. is in close coordination with the business sector for additional support.
The health official said the purchase of vaccines by private companies for the priority sectors and their employees is important, especially since workers are at risk of contracting COVID-19 because of their daily exposure.International media recently reported that AstraZeneca is working with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute to create a combination vaccine.
Gamaleya is another vaccine developer applying for clinical trials in the Philippines. However, its application has not yet moved forward because of incomplete documents.
Vergeire said there should not be any problem with the new development. She said it will not affect Gamaleya’s existing application since it refers only to Sputnik V.
“Also, if they are going to go through this partnership and come in the country, then we need to have it undergo the regulatory process,” she said.
The Philippines has logged 449,400 confirmed COVID-19 cases, as of Dec. 13, of which, 21,980 are active infections, 8,733 resulted in deaths, and 418,687 have recovered.

MANILA - The Philippine travel industry should restart even if the country is still waiting for the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, an official of the country's largest airline said on Wednesday.While advanced countries are already rolling out vaccination programs against COVID-19 this December, the government has said that the earliest it may start inoculating Filipinos was around March or April next year.
""I think while everyone is really hoping for the vaccine, I think we cannot afford to wait for the vaccine to get here before we start confidently flying again and restarting because of the impact of travel and tourism to the economy,"" said Candice Iyog, vice president at Cebu Pacific Air.
The operator of the Mactan Cebu International Airport also said that a vaccination program was ""not critical"" to restarting the industry.
Andrew Harrison, chief executive advisor of GMR Megawide Cebu Airport Corporation (GMCAC), said the travel industry can restart even if the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccination program gets delayed.
""I don't think that will be detrimental,"" said Harrison during a webinar organized by Cebu Pacific.
""It will be a value for some people but it's not a key criteria to ensure the resurgence of travel,"" Harrison said.
He added that it was more important to set up a simpler and easier system for letting people know which destinations they can go to, and what requirements they need.""Our hotline is swamped with people calling us, asking us what are the various requirements. And so clearly, people find it complex and they're not sure how to access this information readily.""

The Department of Tourism said its survey showed that 60 percent of Filipinos are willing to travel around the country despite the absence of a vaccine.
Meanwhile, the DOT said it supports the creation of a ""COVID-19 passport"" which was suggested by Cebu Pacific Air president Lance Gokongwei.
""The DOT recognizes that a COVID-19 passport is vital to reviving international travel as it will restore the trust and confidence of people to travel to other countries once more while assuring receiving countries that their inbound tourists are vaccinated,"" said Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat.
Tourism Undersecretary Benito Bengzon said there are already talks among industry players about the proposed passport.
""There have been initial discussions and even IATA (International Air Transport Association) has a proposal. We're looking at the different options but I think what is clear is we would want travel to be safer, we want it to be more convenient. We will explore all possible ways of making it easier for the traveling public to move around,"" he said.
Currently, seven areas in the Philippines have already reopened to domestic tourists, specifically, Boracay, El Nido, Baguio, Ilocos Sur, Ilocos Norte, Lapu-Lapu City, and Coron in Siargao.
DOT said it's already working on opening more tourist sites in the coming year.

""May I just address myself to every government worker...do not delay or do not hinder, do not obstruct the smooth flow na nakikita ninyo ngayon, from the time of the arrival, to the time of clearance,"" he said.
""Ang trabaho lang ninyo sa Customs is magtingin. You have no business na buksan-buksan 'yan. You are not allowed to do that. I am not allowing anybody, anybody there sa airport na magbukas bukas,"" Duterte warned airport and Bureau of Customs employees.

Vergeire said the WHO will announce the trial sites and other details this week.
As for the pharmaceutical companies dealing separately with the Philippines, Vergeire said the vaccine from Chinese company Sinovac is moving forward, following an expert panel’s approval.
She said the panel will meet with the ethics review board to discuss if the company’s application for Phase 3 clinical trials can undergo processing by the Food and Drug Administration.
While most vaccine developers plan to just market their vaccines to the Philippines, some like Sinovac are interested in holding large-scale clinical tests in the country.
Vergeire said Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, one of those interested in holding clinical trials, is already in touch with a local research organization.
“Yung sa Gamaleya yung contract research organization (CRO) nakikipagusap na sila so that the CRO would be the ones to represent them here in the country,” she said.

MANILA - As the Philippines received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccines last Sunday, President Rodrigo Duterte provided a somber forecast on when the country could expect to go back to normal life.
""Early in the first, maybe first or second quarter of year '23, 2023, baka, tulong ng Diyos (maybe with the help of God),” Duterte said when asked about the when the Philippines could return to normalcy.Small business owners, eager for the economy and their earnings to return to normal, were confused by the forecast.
Isabel Sabio runs a canteen in Quezon City. She was forced to cut her staff in half because of weak sales during the pandemic.Even now, she only earns enough to pay her staff, her rent, and her other expenses.“Tiyaga lang kasi hinihintay namin maging normal,” Sabio said.(We carry on because we're waiting for things to go back to normal.)
When Sabio heard the President only expects things to return to normal in 2023, she balked.""Parang ang tagal naman. Di ba may vaccine na ngayon? Parang ang ine-expect ko na malapit na. Eh bakit ang tagal pa?,"" Sabio said.(That seems too distant. Isn't there already a vaccine? I'm expecting that it will be soon. Why will it take that long?)
Melda Serrano, who owns an agricultural store in Manila, also said 2023 was too far away a target for a return to normalcy.""Ay, masyado pong mahaba kung ganyan,"" Serrano said.
(That's too long.)
Serrano been getting by with online sales, but she was still forced to reduce the salaries of her workers.""Dapat po by this year ma-ano na po, para makaahon ahon ang ekonomiya ng Pilipinas.”(They should do it this year so that the Philippine economy can recover.)
Gilbert Sangalang, who runs a sounds and lights store in Manila, meanwhile gives a more generous interpretation of Duterte's statement.""Sa ngayon kasi, medyo bukas na halos lahat diba? Baka 2022 OK na yan, 23 mas OK na tayo. Baka sinasabi ng Pangulo, yun na yung pinaka da best natin, 23.”(Right now, almost everything is open, right? Maybe 2022 it's going to be OK. 2023 will be more OK. Maybe what the President is saying is that the best will be in 2023.)
Sangalang was forced to lay off workers and plead with his landlord for an extension on his rent.He also believes the vaccination program should speed up the return to normalcy.“Malaking tulong yan. Wala pa ngang bakuna, excited na tayo dumating yung mga yon eh. Ngayong dumating na, kailangan magpaturok, kailangan natin para bumalik yung dati,"" Sangalang said.(That's a big help. We were already excited when the vaccines had yet to arrive. Now that they're here, we need to get jabbed, we need this to go back to how things were before.)
An economist meanwhile has criticized Duterte's 2023 target, saying the President was ""setting the bar too low"" and warned that the Chief Executive's statement will also damage and delay the country's economic recovery.
Last year, the Philippines suffered its worst economic contraction since the end of World War 2. Economists expect the recession to extend to the first three months of 2021.
The Philippines is the last country in Southeast Asia to receive COVID-19 vaccines.A shipment of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines donated by China arrived on Sunday.Another shipment from British drugmaker AstraZeneca was supposed to arrive last Monday, but the delivery was postponed indefinitely, officials said.

MANILA — The Food and Drug Administration on Friday said the country’s vaccine expert panel recently received and is now studying the application of United Kingdom-based drug maker AstraZeneca to hold COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines.
“The vaccine expert panel is now evaluating several applications or several that signified interest (in running clinical trials in the country),” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said during a virtual briefing.
“Recently we accepted an application from AstraZeneca,” he added, after mentioning the other vaccine developers also interested in clinical trials in the Philippines such as Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, China’s Clover Biopharmaceuticals and European firm Janssen Pharmaceutical.Video from DOH
AstraZeneca is a British pharmaceutical company that partnered with Oxford University in developing a COVID-19 vaccine.Recent reports said the vaccine showed encouraging immune response among the elderly. It is one of the several vaccines that have already reached the Phase 3 process for vaccine development.
Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire during the same briefing told media that she and Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the Philippines’ designated vaccine czar and chief implementer of the country's national policy against COVID-19, met with AstraZeneca recently.
“They have that intention,” she said. “Sa ganyan magandang indikasyon 'yan kasi gusto ng Philippine government na talagang mai-try out muna sa ating mga Pilipino bago natin umpisahan ang pagbabakuna sa ating kababayan,” she said.
(That is a good indication because the Philippine government wants to have vaccines tested first among Filipinos before it is distributed to many.)
Domingo said only Chinese company Sinovac has finished the pre-evaluation process of the vaccine expert panel and is now officially lodged with the FDA.
“Mukhang konting documentation na lang 'yung kulang (ng Sinovac) para ma-complete ang requirements ng ating regulatory reviewers and of course the ethics boards and the FDA,” he said. “Hopefully this will all be resolved soon.”
(It seems there are only a few documents remaining to complete the requirements of our regulatory reviewers and of course the ethics boards and the FDA. Hopefully this will all be resolved soon.)
If Sinovac is able to pass the FDA process, it may be the first company to hold COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials in the Philippines. There is still no definite date for the World Health Organization’s multi-country clinical trials, which will test several vaccines against COVID-19.
Vergeire previously explained that it is better to have clinical trials in the country to check if a vaccine is safe and effective for Filipinos. She said vaccines may have different effects on different races.

FILE / Mark Demayo, ABS-CBN NewsMANILA - European companies operating in the Philippines are putting expansion plans on hold, with some withdrawing altogether new investments, a study released Thursday showed as the coronavirus pandemic impact operations.
According to the Business Impact Survey done by the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines (ECCP) and the European Union, the COVID-19 pandemic affected investment strategies and decisions at varying degrees with 29 percent of the companies surveyed putting on hold additional investments.
At least 28.2 percent are delaying investment decisions, 10.9 percent are cancelling or withdrawing initial investment decisions, 10.5 percent modifying investment strategies, and 3.4 percent considering relocation of some economic activities.It said only 1.3 percent are increasing investments in the Philippines while 16.8 percent will have no changes in its current strategies.
Travel restrictions, reduced demand and business cash flow are among the key concerns for companies surveyed with majority expressing dissatisfaction over current measures done to curb the spread of the virus and the government's economic stimulus program.Metro Manila and Calabarzon, with the rest of Luzon, were placed under strict quarantine after cases of COVID-19 rapidly rose in March.
Metro Manila, home to roughly a tenth of the Philippines' 100 million population, accounts for a third of the country's gross domestic product while neighboring Southern Tagalog region serves as home to several economic zones and industrial plants.
The Philippines fell into recession following a steep contraction in second quarter GDP due to the impact of COVID-19 and resulting lockdowns.Metro Manila, Rizal, Bulacan, Cavite and Laguna are back under modified enhanced community quarantine until Aug. 18 following an appeal from medical frontliners for ""breathing space"" due to a spike in COVID-19 cases.
ECCP said the ""economy cannot afford"" extending further the MECQ in Metro Manila and other provinces, citing a rise in unemployment.
""Our economy cannot afford it anymore… Business, they need to grow, people they (need) work. As I said, 17.7 percent is the unemployment rate, so people are jobless. They don’t have savings anymore so we have no choice,” said ECCP president Nabil Francis.
It is important for the economy to restart, Nabil said as the strategy cannot be based on the hope of getting a vaccine while people remain in confinement.
The Business Impact Survey was done from May 22 to July 22 and collected responses from 203 companies.Almost half of the respondents represent large businesses, while 52.2 percent come from micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, it said.",abscbn

MANILA (UPDATE) - The Philippines has a financing plan to purchase at least 40 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines once it becomes available to be administered for free to the poorest 20 million Filipinos, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said Friday.
The Department of Health can procure the approved vaccines with the help of the Philippine International Trading Corp and financed by the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines, Dominguez said in a televised address.
The PITC, under the Department of Trade and Industry, is engaged in trading and bulk importation of essential goods for the government including medicines, among others.
Vaccines being developed across the world could be approved before December, he said. Purchased vaccines will be turned over to the DOH, he added.

""May financing plan kami dyan. Ang estimate we will need to vaccinate for free for a minimum of 20 million people...The financing is available for this program,"" Dominguez said.
(We have a financing plan for that. Our estimate is that we will need to vaccinate for free for a minimum of 20 million people)
""Poorest of the poor muna (first), lowest 20 million of our country,"" he added.
If the 20 million poorest Filipinos need 2 shots each, estimated at $10 (P500) per dose, that would be $400 million or ""roughly P20 billion,"" Dominguez said.
Landbank and the DBP are capable of financing that P20 billion, which is payable in 2 to 3 years, he said.
At P500 per dose, a vaccine shot inclusive of service and transport could cost about P1,200, he said.
Dominguez said the economy ""is actually beginning to recover,"" after contracting in the first quarter. Third quarter numbers are expected to be released on Aug. 6.
""It’s already picking up now And we’re going to be seeing a pickup in business activity as we go on,"" he said.
The economy is ""not short on money,"" the Peso is the ""strongest in Asia"" and inflation is also within target, he said.

MANILA - Vaccine rollout in various Asian nations will pave the way for the faster rebound of the aviation sector which was badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic, AirAsia group CEO Tony Fernandes said Monday.The rollout of vaccines in Malaysia, the progress in Indonesia, Singapore, China, Australia as well as the scheduled inoculation in Thailand and the Philippines are keys to ""a global travel reboot in the near future,"" Fernandes said in a statement.
“After a year of uncertainty, it’s great to see that this extremely challenging chapter is finally coming to a close,"" he said.
“Never before has there been such a restricted global travel environment. After a year of strict cost containment including exiting Japan and reducing our stake in India, finally, there is light at the end of this very long tunnel,"" he added.
For AirAsia, the downtime, which grounded many planes worldwide, was used to accelerate digital initiatives such as its super app, logistics, e-commerce, fintech and other innovations including facial recognition, it said in a statement.
Fernandes said he remains optimistic about reaching its fundraising target of RM2.5 billion (P30 billion). AirAsia Group Berhad raised RM250 million last week, it said.
Its local arm, AirAsia Philippines earlier announced it would lay off at least 12 percent of its workers or over 200 employees.
Domestic and international carriers have retrenched workers, reduced operations and implemented various cost-cutting measures to stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MANILA - San Miguel Corp said Tuesday it is spending almost P1 billion to vaccinate all of its 70,000 employees against COVID-19 for free.
The company said it has secured COVID-19 vaccines from various sources and is currently preparing employees for vaccination with its “Ligtas Lahat” task force, in coordination with the government.
Receiving the vaccines is voluntary, but SMC President Ramon Ang said he hopes that all of their eligible employees will sign up for vaccination.
“Our program...aims to create a safe and healthy workplace so that we can further contribute to our country’s economic recovery,” Ang, said.
The government is allowing the private sector to procure its own vaccines against COVID-19. Procurement of vaccines will be free from taxes and duties until Dec. 31, 2023.

""The development program will begin immediately, with the target of introducing the vaccine in 2022, subject to regulatory approval,"" a joint statement said.
GSK will also support the manufacture this year of up to 100 million doses of CureVac's first generation COVID-19 vaccine, it added.

A more contagious COVID-19 variant first spotted in Britain has spread across the globe, according to the World Health Organization.
Another variant, detected initially in South Africa, has raised greater alarm among researchers over its possible impact on immunity.
The coronavirus has killed more than 2.2 million people since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019, according to an AFP tally based on official sources.
More than 100 million vaccines have meanwhile been given around the world but none of the world's 29 poorest countries has formally started mass inoculations.
Separately on Wednesday, GSK revealed that net profits soared by almost a quarter last year on the back of divestments.
Profit after taxation jumped 24 percent to £5.7 billion ($7.8 billion, 6.5 billion euros) in 2020 from a year earlier, GSK said in a results statement.
Revenues however rose by just one percent to £34 billion, with vaccine sales hit as governments prioritized COVID-19 vaccines -- and more disruption expected in 2021.
""For our vaccines business, we now anticipate further disruption during the first half of the year, given governments' prioritization of COVID-19 vaccination programs and the resurgence in late 2020 of the pandemic,"" GSK noted.
""This is expected to impact adult and adolescent immunizations, including (shingles vaccine) Shingrix, notably in the United States.""

Shamil Zhumatov, Reuters/File
MEXICO CITY - Mexico on Tuesday approved Russia's Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine for emergency use in the country, one of the worst hit by the pandemic, following the release of positive trial results.
The move is a boost to the Latin American nation's efforts to keep its immunization program on track in the face of limited supplies from other manufacturers.
Regulatory agency Cofepris ""has just granted authorization for the emergency use of the Sputnik V vaccine,"" deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a news conference.
The shot -- named after the Soviet-era satellite -- faced criticism last year when it was approved in Russia before large-scale clinical trials.
But analysis of data from 20,000 Phase 3 trial participants, published Tuesday in medical journal The Lancet, suggests that the 2-dose vaccination offers more than 90 percent efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19.Russia's Sputnik V vaccine 91.6% effective, says study
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said last week after talking to President Vladimir Putin by telephone that Russia had agreed to provide 24 million doses of Sputnik V.
Mexico has more than 1.8 million known coronavirus cases and nearly 160,000 deaths -- the world's third-highest fatality toll after the United States and Brazil.
The country began mass immunization on Dec. 24 but so far has only used the vaccine developed by US drugs giant Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech.
Mexico's COVID-19 death toll surpasses India, becomes world's third highest
It has also authorized the shot developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, and has a deal to produce the vaccine in collaboration with Argentina.
Sputnik V is registered in more than a dozen other countries including former Soviet republics and allies such as Venezuela and Iran, as well as South Korea, Argentina, Algeria, Tunisia and Pakistan.

MANILA — At least 2 senators on Friday denied that a legislative probe into the country's COVID-19 inoculation drive favors any vaccine brand, contrary to insinuations by President Rodrigo Duterte.The Senate has ""nothing but good intentions in conducting the hearings,"" said the chamber's leader, Senate President Vicente Sotto III.""We, the members oft the Senate, do not favor any particular brand of vaccines, but we favor any vaccine that is correctly priced, properly procured and distributed,"" he said in an opening statement in the third hearing on the country's COVID-19 vaccination plan.
Some senators earlier questioned the procurement of the vaccine from China's Sinovac, which was reportedly pricier and less efficient than other brands.On Monday, Duterte offered to buy Pfizer vaccines for the Senate as he scored some of its members for pushing the government to buy jabs from the US-based pharmaceutical giant.""Kaya nakakalungkot po ang akusasyon ng Malakanyang na kaya daw tayo mausisa ay dahil may pinapaboran daw tayong brand ng bakuna,"" said Sen. Risa Hontiveros during Friday's probe.(Malacañang's accusation that we are probing because we are favoring a vaccine brand is saddening.)

Hontiveros, who Duterte singled out in his Monday speech, said the hearing should find out the vaccines' efficacy rate, their price, accessibility, and complete data.""Hindi namin kailangan na maging medrep ang alin mang bahagi ng gobyerno. We just need to trust that you will guard the health of Filipinos by bringing only the best and the safest vaccines here,"" said the lawmaker.(We don't need any part of the government to be a medical representative.)
The Philippines aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of its population, this year.

According to Logunov, tests they have done on both animals and humans showed that their proposed COVID-19 vaccine does not cause any side effects.
He said they have tested the vaccine on various animals including mice, hamsters, rabbits and primates, and there was ""no damage inflicted on their lungs.""
He also said that after receiving the vaccine, 100 percent of those who participated in the trials had virus neutralizing antibodies, which proves the efficacy of the vaccine.
Russia has developed 'first' coronavirus vaccine: Putin
Russia said Saturday that it has produced the first batch of its coronavirus vaccine, after President Vladimir Putin announced it had been first in the world to approve a vaccine.
Putin's announcement about the vaccine was met with caution from scientists and the World Health Organization who said it still needed a rigorous safety review.
Putin said the vaccine was safe and that one of his own daughters had been inoculated, though clinical trials were not yet complete and final stage testing involving more than 2,000 people only started this week.
Western scientists were skeptical, with some warning that moving too quickly on a vaccine could be dangerous, but Russia denounced criticism as an attempt to undermine Moscow's research.
The Russian vaccine is called ""Sputnik V"" after the Soviet-era satellite that was the first launched into space in 1957.

The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 787,00 people and sickened 22.4 million since it emerged in China last December, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University.
The Philippines, which is struggling to contain the virus, has accepted Russia's offer to participate in production of the vaccine.
The Philippines and Russia are planning to start phase 3 clinical trials of Moscow's coronavirus vaccine by October, Malacañang said Thursday.
The tests will run until March of next year and will be done simultaneously in Manila and Moscow, Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said.
Phase 3 clinical trials, according to the website of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), involves ""300 to 3,000 volunteers who have the disease or condition,"" and aims to test the efficacy and monitoring of adverse reactions to the drug.
The novel coronavirus has so far sickened 178,022 people in the country. The tally includes 2,883 deaths, 114,114 recoveries and 61,025 active cases.
Philippines reports 4,339 new coronavirus cases; total now 178,022

MANILA - The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is finalizing AstraZeneca's application for emergency use authorization (EUA) of its COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines, with a ""very favorable"" evaluation forwarded by experts, an official said Wednesday.FDA Director General Eric Domingo said their experts and regulatory panel have submitted their recommendations on the vaccine.
“Aayusin ko lamang po at titingnan ang ating mga tinatawag na kondisyon para makita natin at ma-finalize na. Pero very favorable naman po ang tingin ko dito sa ating mga evaluation po ng mga experts natin,” said Domingo.
(I will take a look at it and see if they complied with our conditions before finalizing it. But I think the evaluation of our experts is very favorable.)
The Philippines has secured 17 million doses of AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccines with the help of the private sector and local government units.

The first initial dosages is expected to arrive in the country by mid-year.
The issuance of an EUA will allow its use in the Philippines under an expedited review period.Aside from AstraZeneca, the country was also able to secure 30 million vaccines from the Serum Institute of India and 25 million doses from China’s Sinovac.

In an interview on TeleRadyo, Domingo said Sinovac and Russia’s Sputnik V have already submitted data for clinical trials and that their respective COVID-19 vaccines are currently undergoing experts’ evaluation.
“Wala nang pending application for clinical trials sa FDA. 'Yung tatlong nag-apply, na-approve na natin 'yan—yung sa Janssen o company ng Johnson & Johnson, 'yung Clover Pharmaceuticals at saka 'yung Sinovac. Maari na silang mag-umpisa ng kanilang clinical trials,” he said.(There are no other pending application for clinical trials in the FDA. The other three that applied were already approved—Janssen or the company of Johnson & Johnson, the Clover Pharmaceutical and Sinovac. They can now start their clinical trials.)
The FDA stressed that even if other countries are now using COVID-19 vaccines, it is important that they go through clinical trials especially is they are still under emergency use.
He explained that data from clinical trials of these vaccines are not yet complete and that they would have to recruit new participants.
“Usually, 'yung clinical trials natin nagkakaroon ng sanga-sanga 'yan. Halimbawa, susubukan sa matatandang-matatanda, tapos ngayon magsta-start na rin naman sa buong mundo clinical trials sa younger population kasi as of now, wala pang bakuna for children.

MANILA—The price point of Sinovac vaccines that the Department of Health previously showed to the Senate was from a news report the DOH found in a Google search, Health Secretary Francisco Duque told senators Friday.Senators query PH government's preference for China vaccine after new efficacy data
Sen. Panfilo Lacson, meanwhile, did not agree with Duque’s methodology, suggesting there should have been a more thorough study of the pricing than just using a Reuters report.
In Senate hearings held in November 2020, the China-made vaccine was projected to be priced at P3,629.50 for 2 doses, according to data from Sen. Sonny Angara's office last December 9.That was cheaper only to Moderna — tabbed to be about P3,904 and P4,504 for 2 doses — among brands presented to the Senate.
That rate caused public backlash after it was discovered that other countries bought Sinovac jabs cheaper.The DOH submitted the figure to the Senate committee on finance chaired by Angara.On Friday, Lacson asked how Duque came up with the rate.
“I was told, Mr. Chairman, ito iyong ginoogle nila at lumabas nga itong sa Reuters,” Duque said.“Nakalagay po rito, ‘Sinovac coronavirus vaccine offered by Chinese city for emergency use costs $60’. Tapos nag-compute po for VAT so mga P300 plus and another iyon pong in-assume nila na inflation, medical inflation, of about another 10%. So lumabas pong P3,629.50.”Speaking to Sen. Francis Pangilinan, Duque said: “Galing po, for the record, from the published Google price ng Sinovac at $60 . . . Indicative lang po ito for budget planning purposes na iyan po ay ginamit.”
Duque said his department relied on publications, such as Financial Straits, although no such media organization exists.“Sa Financial Straits, tsaka sa ibang publication lumabas po ito. Nagdadag lang po ng VAT (value added tax) na 12 percent kaya nagtaas, plus inflation rate . . . So lumabas P3,629,” Duque said.The DOH’s Public Health Services Office and the Supply Chain Management Office came up with the computation, Duque said.Lacson reprimanded the DOH for sourcing their pricing from news reports.2020 most difficult year in history of DOH — Duque
“Maybe this would serve as a lesson for future submission na dapat bago tayo mag-submit, accurate at validated iyong data . . . Du’n medyo nag-start ang controversy, especially sa infographic ng Bangkok Post,” Lacson told Duque.The backlash on the earlier pricing forced vaccine czar Carlito Galvez to issue a clarification, saying the country procured Sinovac vaccines at a price between those of the Indian prices and Indonesian prices.

The Reuters report posted October 15, 2020, said the Chinese city of Jiaxing was offering Sinovac Biotech’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine to essential workers and other high-risk groups as part of a national program for about $60.
Jiaxing’s center for disease control and prevention said in a statement on WeChat at the time that two doses of the vaccine candidate, called CoronaVac, will cost 200 yuan ($29.75) per dose and that vaccinations for key groups including medical professionals have begun.
In the same report, Reuters said Bio Farma, a state-owned firm in Indonesia which had reached a deal for at least 40 million doses from Sinovac, said that week the vaccine will cost around 200,000 rupiah ($13.60) per dose when it becomes available in the southeast Asian country.

City health authorities are also negotiating with other manufacturers to increase its vaccine supply. Its local cold storage facility can handle temperatures of -22 degree Celsius.
During the interview, Gatchalian said he expected that vaccine hesitancy and validation of those eligible for inoculation were among the challenges in the rollout.
He said they would use the city's contact tracing system, ValTrace, in validating eligible recipients. They will also hire additional nurses who will administer the vaccines, he added.

MANILA — The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Thursday it might clear a coronavirus vaccine candidate for emergency use in January at the earliest.
With President Rodrigo Duterte's authorization, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) in 21 to 28 days after the application of a vaccine maker, said the agency's Director General Eric Domingo. The regulatory body is normally required to verify a drug for 6 months before allowing its use.
Applicants should have an equivalent EUA from the country where they were developed, the World Health Organization, or a ""stringent"" regulatory authority, said Domingo.
""Maaari pong by first few weeks of January, mayroon na rin po tayong maibigay na emergency use authorization,"" he told reporters.
""Baka mapaaga nang kaunti, baka magkaroon ng chance na mga March, magkaroon na ng bakuna dito sa Pilipinas,"" added.
(It is possible that by the first few weeks of January, we can already issue an emergency use authorization. Perhaps in March, there may already be a vaccine here in the Philippines.)

China is already allowing the use of its COVID-19 vaccines Sinovac and Sinopharm. The UK on Wednesday approved the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, while the US is expected to do the same for Moderna and Pfizer.
These 4 vaccine brands might be the first to apply for emergency use in the Philippines, said Domingo.

Dr. Rontgene Solante, head of San Lazaro Hospital’s Adult Infectious Diseases and Tropical Medicine Department, said the vaccine would undergo rigorous evaluation before public use.
""Hindi rin natin masasabi na may shortcut dahil (We could not also say there was a shortcut because) if they are being approved by their [counterpart] Food and Drug Administration or regulatory offices doon sa mga bansa nila (from their originating country), then that would stand as enough evidence that these vaccines are good,"" he told Teleradyo.
Solante said the Sinovac-made jab would undergo another examination by the Philippines' panel of vaccine experts before its use for inoculations in the country.
He noted that many were speaking ill of the COVID-19 shots before it was being assessed, which could affect public confidence in vaccines.
""We need to trust our regulatory bodies and the process which the regulatory bodies are doing just to evaluate these vaccines,"" Solante said.
Philippines secures 25 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from China's Sinovac
The Philippines has secured 25 million COVID-19 vaccine doses from Sinovac, Malacañang had said. Of this number, some 50,000 doses are expected to arrive in February and will be given to health care workers.
EXPLAINER: What we know about China-made vaccines
In a late-stage trial in Brazil, Sinovac's anti-coronavirus vaccine showed a general efficacy of less than 60 percent. Philippine officials earlier said this was ""acceptable.""
Indonesia had already given the vaccine emergency use approval based on interim data showing it was 65 percent effective.

MANILA – At least three senators on Monday said they believe vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. is ""clear"" of any wrongdoing in his duty to procure COVID-19 vaccines for the government's inoculation program amid concerns over the choice of vaccines and alleged overpricing.
Senate President Tito Sotto, chairman of Senate committee of the whole which tackled the government's inoculation roadmap, said he is confident transactions entered into by Galvez's team would be aboveboard.
Asked if Galvez and other vaccine officials can be categorized as ""off-the-hook"" against any possible lapses or perceived overpricing of the vaccine, Sotto said: ""Yes. Safeguards are in place... They had nothing to do with the original proposed prices that never was.""
The panel is currently drafting its report, in aid of legislation.
Galvez, he said, also assured the Senate of giving them regular updates over the matter.
""We will be updated every step of the way,"" Sotto said.
Sen. Panfilo Lacson, who earlier criticized Galvez because of the Sinovac deal, also cleared the vaccine czar of any possible wrongdoing.
Galvez defends purchase of Sinovac vaccine
""As shared by many senators, I have no reason to doubt Sec. Galvez’s integrity, although some unverified reports that some shenanigans working behind the scene might have fed the DOH the unreasonably high price of the Sinovac vaccine could lend credence to the attempt to dupe the Filipino taxpayers even during a pandemic,"" Lacson said.
The price point of Sinovac vaccines that the Department of Health previously showed to the Senate was from a news report the DOH found in a Google search, Health Secretary Francisco Duque admitted last week.
You just googled it? Lacson tells Duque vaccine pricing data must be ‘validated’
Meanwhile, Sen. Risa Hontiveros, who belongs to the minority bloc, also agreed with Lacson and Sotto's assessment of Galvez.
""I share the observations regarding Sec. Galvez. So, in large part pag i-average out natin yung performance nila... nasagot naman niya yung aming mga tanong, at nag-iwan ng isang commitment na aming panghahawakan sa pag-rollout ng vaccination program,"" Hontiveros said.
Galvez had earlier denied reports of ""kickbacks"" on the government's vaccine procurement deals, saying such accusations are ""hurtful.""

MANILA— National Task Force on COVID-19 chief implementer and peace adviser Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.’s appointment as COVID-19 vaccine czar will not cause any changes in the government’s vaccine plan, the Department of Health (DOH) said Wednesday, amid criticism the position should have been given to a medical expert.
Instead, Galvez will fast-track the procurement and rollout of coronavirus vaccines once it becomes available, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a virtual press briefing.
“We will not change anything in our processes just because he was assigned as vaccine czar. All the processes would still be continued,” she said in Filipino.

The health ministry supports the appointment of the former military chief, who will lead the country in the purchase, negotiation, production and distribution of vaccines against the disease, Vergeire said.
“He was placed in that role so we will have a more expeditious and more efficient manner of doing all of these things that we need for the vaccines that will be brought here,” she said.
Malacañang earlier explained Galvez's new appointment, saying a vaccine czar needs ""managerial skills.""
Why is COVID-19 vaccine czar an ex-general? 'Managerial skills' needed, says Palace
Vergeire stressed they had already formed a vaccine expert panel from the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), a technical advisory group from the DOH and vaccinologists from different scientific institutions to ensure the vaccines would be safe and effective.
“This would be still be a whole-of-government, a whole-of-society approach. Secretary Galvez will not be working alone. We will help him. We will support him. The whole government will,” she said.
As of Tuesday, the Philippines has recorded 387,161 coronavirus infections with 7,318 fatalities. The tally includes 348,967 recoveries and 30,876 active cases.

MANILA — The health department on Friday said it was open to Russia’s plan of setting up a COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing and distributing hub in the Philippines, as the development could give country a medical advantage.“This will provide us with that advantage. Hindi lang dito sa pandemyang ito but in the coming years na magkakaroon tayo ng pangangailangan ulit na ganito,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a virtual briefing.(This will provide us with that advantage.

“Hindi lang yung fill and finish na manufacturing plant meron talagang planta ng bakuna (It’s not just about a fill and finish manufacturing plant but there are also talks of an actual manufacturing plant for vaccines),” she said.
The DOH previously said the country was also considering repackaging the vaccines or taking on the fill-and-finish process since the Philippines does not have a factory yet for vaccines.
Despite the Philippines’ eagerness to set up its own vaccine plant, Vergeire said they made sure to inform the Russian government “that everything has to go through the regulatory processes.""
Back in April, the World Health Organization advised the Philippines to prepare for the arrival of the COVID-19 vaccines. This included having laboratories that can test the quality and safety of vaccines.

MANILA - Armed with the hopes of a coronavirus vaccine by December, President Rodrigo Duterte on Friday said he expects life in the country to return to normal by the end of the year even as the country continues to battle the pandemic.
Duterte, in an address taped Thursday and aired Friday morning, rejected calls to adapt to a ""new normal"" or a life upended by the virus, saying the Philippines could return to the way things were before the pandemic disrupted the world.
""I promise you by the grace of God, I hope by December we would be back to normal. Huwag ninyo ‘yang new normal, new normal kasi sabi ko nga noon pag-umpisa natin hintayin lang natin ‘yung vaccine,"" the President said.
(Don't mind the new normal because as I told you from the start, we'll wait for the vaccine.)
""We are not going back to a new normal. It’s going to be normal again,"" he added.
COVID-19, which has infected over 17 million people worldwide and plunged several nations into recession, was first reported in a Chinese province in December last year and has since become a global health and economic crisis.
The pandemic forced the first contraction of the Philippine economy since 1998 at 0.2 percent in March or while most of the country was on strict lockdown.
In April, government data showed that unemployment soared to 17.7 percent which translates to some 7.3 million jobless Filipinos.
Jobless Filipinos balloon to 7.3 million in April as unemployment soars in lockdown
As the pandemic continues to threaten the life and livelihood of Filipinos, Duterte is pinning his hopes on China, which he said could be the source of Manila's first COVID-19 vaccine.
""Ang una nga makuha siguro natin from China,"" Duterte said, noting that China's Sinopharm and Sinovac have reported progress in their inactive vaccines.
(The first ones we could get would probably be from China.)
Chinese firms are responsible for 2 of the 3 most advanced coronavirus vaccines that had entered Phase 3 trials, or large-scale testing on humans -- the last step before regulatory approval.
China says to prioritize Philippines for COVID-19 vaccineCOVID-19 IMMUNIZATION PLAN
Should a COVID-19 vaccine be made available soon, President Duterte said the government would prioritize the ""poorest of the poor.""
""Ang mauna, 'yung walang-wala at saka of course those in the hospitals, ‘yung mga sick or dying. Ang una talaga 'yung mga tao sa listahan na tumatanggap ng assistance sa gobyerno,” he said.
(We will prioritize the poorest of the poor, and those who are sick and dying in hospitals. The priority is really those who accept aid from the government.)
The government could provide free immunization for 20 million of the poorest people in the country, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III said as the Philippines could initially purchase at least 40 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines with the help of the Philippine International Trading Corp, and financed by the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines.
""May financing plan kami dyan. Ang estimate we will need to vaccinate for free for a minimum of 20 million people...The financing is available for this program,"" Dominguez said.
(We have a financing plan for that. Our estimate is that we will need to vaccinate for free for a minimum of 20 million people)
Philippines can fund free COVID-19 vaccines for 20M poor Filipinos: Dominguez
The President said he would leave the distribution of the vaccines to the military-- which he hailed as the ""backbone"" of his administration along with the police.
Soldiers, police officers, and middle-income earners would also be eligible for free COVID-19 immunization, the President said.

He, however, apologized to well-off Filipinos, saying they should purchase their own vaccines and rejected immunizing drug offenders, who he labeled as ""dogs.""
""Itong mga mayaman, huwag na ninyo akong isipin kasi hindi ako nag-iisip sa inyo. Sorry na lang,"" he said.
(To the rich, don't think of me because I don't think of you. I'm sorry.)
The President revealed the government's immunization plan just as the Philippines reported on Thursday 3,954 new COVID-19 cases, the highest single-day tally since the country recorded its first COVID-19 case back in January.
The record-high new cases pushed the country's cumulative total of COVID-19 infections to 89,374, of which, 22,327 are active.

Ubial said it was standard practice in the government that procured medicines should have a shelf life of at least 18 months, and not 16 as alleged by Cruz.
Cruz said the controversy over the P3.4 billion dengue vaccination program is ""just the tip of the iceberg.""
TIMELINE: The Philippines' dengue vaccine program
He questioned the timing of the roll-out of the vaccination program in January 2016, just a few months before the May 2016 presidential election.""Ano ang naging basehan sa pagpili ng beneficiaries ng programa at bakit ito ginawa sa gitna ng eleksyon? Wala namang urgency ang pagbabakuna. Wala namang epidemic. Hindi nga nakaka-prevent ito,"" he said.
""Bakit mo gagawin sa summer vacation? Bakit mo mamadaliin bago mag-eleksyon?""
He also questioned the DOH's implementation of the program, noting that there was no ""full disclosure"" to frontline health workers and parents of the children to be vaccinated.
""Ang minumungkahi ng WHO (World Health Organization) dapat ito ay localized at kasama ang ibang intervention—may vector control po ito. It’s dengue, a vector-borne disease. You cannot have immunization and expect ma-reduce mo yung transmission. Dapat may vector control intervention,"" he said.

LONDON - It slowly dawned on May Parsons that she faced a gargantuan task because the whole world will be watching her do what she has been doing best in the last three years as a peer vaccinator.
It was the moment when the UK took a huge step towards a return to normality. At 6:31 a.m., on a cold December morning, a 90-year-old Coventry grandmother became the first person in the world to have the Pfizer/BioNtech coronavirus vaccine and the inoculation was administered by the British-Filipina matron of Respiratory Wards at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust.
‘Fantastic moment’: Filipino nurse injects historic COVID-19 vaccine to British grandma
“It has given me lots of pride to be able to showcase what Filipinos can achieve, and in terms of the care of the Filipinos-- what we give to the patients and our community. It has given me the opportunity to show how proud I am of the values that we have as Filipinos and the quality of the care that we give. And for me to be chosen, it also showcases the value of hard work,"" Parsons told ABS-CBN News Europe.
She added: “I have been doing this for a long time. Never once in my life did I think that this was going to be the pinnacle of my career to be showcased as the first Filipino-British nurse to administer the vaccine in the pandemic. It just goes to show that hard work really pays off.”
She is part of the Peer Vaccination Programme in her Trust, which advocates the flu jab for everyone during winter season, particularly for NHS staff or peers. For three years running, Parsons had the most vaccine that has been given by a vaccinator. This year she performed 140 jabs in one day gaining her the moniker “prolific jabber.”

Although her team was being prepared for months for the vaccine roll-out, it was only four days before the actual vaccination that she was told that she was the one doing the historic first jab.
Parsons believes she was put there because of the impact of Filipino nurses to the NHS, which to this day account for over 18,000 stronghold workers and the second biggest foreign workers in the National Health Service.
“There are a lot of Filipinos that are holding up the NHS. I think the impact that we have is substantive,” said the mother-of-two who has been a nurse for 24 years and working for 17 years in the same NHS Trust.
She added: “When I was asked if I was happy to do it. It just told me that they valued my contribution. They valued the hard work that I put in. They valued the integrity in the work that I give to my patients and staff.”
FINDING HER CALLING
Parsons grew up in Pasay City and studied at the Baclaran Elementary School Central and went to Arellano University in high school. She wanted to be a cardiac surgeon when her mother developed high blood pressure. But when she was admitted at the University of Sto. Tomas to study nursing, she found her calling.
She graduated in year 2000 and worked at the UST Hospital until she found an opportunity in the UK in 2003.
“I fell in love with the nursing (profession). I thought if I’m going to be a surgeon it’s going to be the best way to interact with your patient and how you can be best for them. Actually, I love this now. I don’t want to be a surgeon anymore.”

An OFW child, whose mother worked in the Middle East for over 20 years, Parsons is a hands-on mother by choice, juggling work and family life while also pursuing a master’s degree in Global Healthcare Leadership at Coventry University.
“Not being with my mom when I was growing up, I thought I want to raise my kids with me, even when I don’t go to sleep. I passed so many opportunities for me to progress because my kids were my priority,” she explained.
Now that COVID cases continue to rise in the UK despite the roll-out of vaccine, she has this to say: “Please don’t be complacent. Don’t think that because there’s vaccine now, you can do whatever you want. Please follow the rules. The government is advising us to stay at home for a reason: that is to avoid cross-contamination.”
She added: ""The frontline where I am, the amount of death is devastating. It’s so soul-breaking and heart-breaking. You will not even imagine how it feels until you are there. So follow the rules.”
While the world is fighting the pandemic, she also wants to leave an inspiring message to those wanting a career in the medical field.
“Pursue your career, pursue dreams, work hard. It does pay off in the end,” she said.

MANILA - President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night reiterated the need for a vaccine for the Philippines to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic, even as he said the potential vaccine from China or Russia will not be for free.
""As I have stated, time and again, repeatedly, the only salvation available to humankind at this time of life, if you are stricken with the virus, the answer is always vaccine,"" Duterte said in a televised public address late Monday.
Duterte also thanked Russia and China anew for expressing their willingness to supply the Philippines with vaccines once these become available.
""I would like to thank Russia, President Putin, and China, President Xi Jinping, for offering to provide us with the vaccine as soon as it is possible for distribution to the public,"" he said.
""I cannot overemphasize my debt of gratitude. But remember that this is not for free, for after all , they did not develop the vaccine without great expense, and also the human effort involved,"" Duterte added.

The Russian government earlier green-lighted its Sputnik V vaccine, claiming to be the world's first against the new coronavirus.
President Vladimir Putin said the vaccine ""passed all the needed checks,"" and that his daughter was among those inoculated.
But the speed with which the vaccine got regulatory approval had experts worried that Russia skipped important steps in vaccine development for the sake of global acclaim.

The Russian vaccine was issued a certificate of registration despite a trial reportedly involving only 76 people, according to an article in sciencemag.org and other news reports. It's among 165 candidate vaccines listed by the WHO as of July 31, and was still in an early phase of development.
In his public address last week, Duterte confirmed willingness to participate in the Russian immunization program.

Ang ating body has to fight. Minsan, na-overwhelm, natatalo siya. That's why you fight for your life inside,"" he said.

However, no vaccine has yet been fully developed against COVID-19, as of June 22, Monday. Most are still in trial stages.
There is also no certainty the preventive medicine will be ready by next year, an expert earlier said.
The World Health Organization's Philippines office has also said that a vaccine against COVID-19 can take at least over a year to develop.

Most companies, including those in China, Japan, the US, and the United Kingdom, are still doing human trials to develop a vaccine against COVID-19.
China National Biotec Group (CNBG) earlier said its experimental coronavirus vaccine has triggered antibodies in clinical trials and the company plans late-stage human trials in foreign countries.

MANILA - More than purchasing vaccines, a proper vaccination program is needed to ensure effectivity of the drug, a former health secretary said Tuesday, as the government plans the rollout of the massive immunization program against COVID-19.
""First of all, I'd like to make a statement that it's not the vaccine that saves lives, it's the vaccination program,"" Dr. Paulyn Ubial told ANC.
""It's a whole lot of other things aside from the vaccine itself that has to work in unison, in consonance with each other so that we get people vaccinated.""
Ubial, who now leads the molecular laboratory of the Philippine Red Cross (PRC), stressed it was important for health authorities to identify which vaccine should be used in the program.
""Number 2 is to educate the people so they are not afraid and we address the issue of vaccine hesitancy, which is really a major issue in this country,"" she said.
The public health expert also noted that those who would handle the logistics of the COVID-19 vaccine such as cold chain would already be prepared.
Ubial said the PRC was working with the Department of Health (DOH) to assist the rolling out of the vaccines to stem the virus, which has infected over 478,000 people in the country.

Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said the measles outbreaks show the importance of vaccines despite a health scare over the controversial Dengvaxia anti-dengue vaccine.""Dapat huwag mawala ang ating tiwala at paniniwala sa ating bakuna ng DOH.

For former health undersecretary Susan Mercado, fighting measles outbreaks in the country is complicated by a number of factors including the present Dengvaxia scare, a shortage in skilled health workers and even cultural sensitivities in parts of the country.""You have to educate the mothers so that they understand why they need to get their kids vaccinated. This Dengvaxia controversy simply does not help,"" she said in an ABS-CBN interview.In December, the Department of Health stopped its dengue immunization program and pull out Dengvaxia from the market after French drug maker Sanofi Pasteur acknowledged that the drug can cause ""severe dengue"" when given to children who had never contracted the mosquito-borne disease.

1 MEASLES CASE EQUALS OUTBREAK
Measles is an infectious disease that can cause death among infants as young as 3 months. Its complications include severe diarrhea, pneumonia and blindness.Measles can be spread by droplets, a cough can transmit the illness quickly to an unvaccinated child. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 90% of the people close to a person with measles who are not immune will be infected.Children are given their first measles shot at 9 months because mothers still have antibodies and gives those antibodies to the child, Mercado said. The second shot is given at 12 months.""Normally, the child is protected from birth until about 9 months when the antibodies go down. So you need the vaccine. If the mother had no antibodies, was never vaccinated, then you have very young children who are at risk from measles. So it is important to get those shots,"" she said.""If you get both shots, you get full immunity [from measles] for life. It’s lifelong protection unlike BCG (for tuberculosis), which needs to be repeated, and hepatitis.""
Mercado said that after the measles vaccine was introduced, cases of measles in developed countries dropped by 99% due to immunization programs.Health authorities always declare an outbreak of measles even with just one confirmed case because the illness is very infectious. One case of measles in an area with low immunization rates can spell disaster.""Just one case of measles gives you reason to be alarmed dahil mabilis siyang kumalat at pwede siyang makapatay ng bata (it spreads fast and can kill kids). Some people think 7 kids [with measles] is not a big thing. For me it is. It's a preventable disease. Dapat wala (There should be none),"" Mercado said.""All you need for an outbreak is a sick patient – patient zero - and a susceptible pool. If you have one sick patient in a community where no one has had vaccination, then an outbreak is likely to occur. But if the sick patient is in a group that has high vaccination, then the illness will not spread,"" she added.MEASLES IN DISNEYLAND
In 2014, US health authorities declared a measles outbreak after 147 people were diagnosed with the illness in several US states.
Investigators said the measles virus which originated from the Disneyland Resort Theme Parks in California shared the same genetic characteristics as the type most commonly found in the Philippines.US measles outbreak over
Mercado, who was working at the World Health Organization at the time, said the US measles outbreak caused genuine concern since the US had already declared itself measles-free in 2000.The outbreak also alarmed developing countries. At least 500 measles cases were diagnosed in January 2017 in European countries where immunization rates have dropped.WHO warns of measles outbreak across Europe
Data from the Department of Health in 2014 also showed that almost all Philippine provinces had one case of measles for the year. As a result, health authorities rolled out a supplemental measles vaccination campaign nationwide for all children between 6 months and 59 months.
As a result, the number of lab-confirmed and epi-linked measles cases went down dramatically in 2015.
Mercado said one way to prevent measles outbreaks is to map out ""pockets of low vaccination rates.""
""If you have pockets of low vaccination rates, that’s where you go. You have to map it. Dapat babalikan at liligawan. (You have to go there and woo them). Dapat ang LGU nakakaintindi, ayaw din naman nila na maraming nagkakasakit (the local government unit must be understanding. They don't want their people to get sick),"" she said.BAD INFO, CULTURAL SENSITIVITY
One challenge in the fight against measles outbreaks is simply bad information.In 2015, the government's immunization campaign in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was delayed due to resistance from parents.DOH-ARMM Sec. Dr. Kadil Sinolinding Jr. said parents refused to have their kids vaccinated after 300 kids were rushed to hospitals due to vomiting and stomach ache after taking deworming tablets.
Why immunization campaign in ARMM is delayed
During the Senate hearing on Dengvaxia, Duque said some groups are intentionally spreading wrong information to instigate fear of other government vaccination programs.
""Certainly, there's an effort to create this hysteria or fear if not panic among parents... This is fanned unnecessarily by systemics that come from certain quarters,"" he said.Amid Dengvaxia scare: Vaccination coverage drops 30 pct in some areas, says Duque
Another challenge in the fight against measles outbreaks is cultural sensitivities in some parts of the country.Mercado said there are groups that simply do not like vaccines. For example, she said some Aetas do not want to go to barangay health centers “kasi kapag pumunta ka sa hospital, ibig sabihin mamamatay ka na.""
(For Aetas, when you go to a hospital, it means you are at the point of death.)
""Tapos ayaw nilang magpa-swero (they don't want to have an IV), so what we had to do was put the IV drip on ourselves to show that we were okay. It is something they have never seen...The cultural part is very important,"" she added.
In the measles outbreak in Zamboanga, she said the DOH had to tap Tausug and Badjao nursing students to go to those areas with suspected measles cases because people have to know the language.""As you go down, the information has to be very localized. At the end of the day, it is still about the mother allowing the vaccination of the child,"" she said.Another issue complicating the measles problem is migration. Areas where there are a lot of transients also need to monitor for possible measles cases, Mercado said.WANTED: HEALTH WORKERS
Complicating the problem further, she said, is the lack of health workers that can carry out vaccination or supplemental immunization activities.In Zamboanga City, she said health authorities had to immunize 120,000 children starting February 19 after diagnosing 287 suspected measles cases ""and they only had 100 workers.""
To solve the problem, the Red Cross asked 3 nursing schools to mobilize another 100 to 200 workers to help with the immunization program.""It’s a problem when we don’t have enough appropriate health care workers distributed in the right places. We need to have more. Pwedeng may supply pero kulang nang tao. (You could have enough supply but lack workers.) Unless you fix that problem, you could have health facilities with not enough people staffing,"" Mercado said, adding that the problem of lack of health workers is not unique to the Philippines.""All countries have that problem. Health is a very human resource intensive industry,"" she said.However, the health expert also noted that at least 1,725 children in Zamboanga failed to receive vaccines after their parents refused ""because of Dengvaxia, or because they simply don't want immunizations.""This, she said, shows the complex mix of challenges that need solving to completely eliminate measles outbreaks in the Philippines.More than just supplying health workers and vaccines, Philippine health authorities must also convince people that vaccines are good for them.""You have to look at each area and pinpoint what the problem is because it is a system problem. In problem solving for an outbreak, it is like an investigation. What caused this and what do you do next? There’s really no general answer. It can be many different things - lack of syringes, outpost delivery, transport, etc.""
""There’s the supply side: the need for health workers and the stock of vaccines. But there's also the campaign, the demand side. Mothers have to want the vaccines and get their kids immunized... It's a no-brainer. It's a preventable disease that has a solution that is doable, affordable, safe, effective,"" she added. ",abscbn

Handout photo.
MANILA -- The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) on Thursday appealed for more recovered patients to donate their blood plasma for an experimental but promising “treatment of last resort” for COVID-19.
At least 60 patients volunteered but only 19 actually donated blood for the convalescent plasma therapy following a strict screening process, said Dr. Jonas Del Rosario, the hospital’s spokesman.
Anti-bodies harnessed from blood plasma, the liquid part of the blood which was extracted from these patients, were later infused in 9 patients, 6 of whom were now either stable or recovering from the respiratory disease, he said.
“We take advantage of those anti-bodies, which, we believe, would neutralize the organism,” he told an online press conference.

'Our heroes': COVID-19 survivors donate blood plasma, raise hopes for treatment
At least 693 patients have recovered from the disease in the Philippines, where the death toll was at 446 as of Wednesday.
This means that there are more prospective donors that could help those, who are still sick, defeat the virus through passive immunization.
Del Rosario acknowledged that many recovered patients were discouraged from coming forward because of the “fear and anxiety of being discriminated.” He cited cases where donors asked the PGH to protect their identities.
“They now have an opportunity to rise above the stigma of the disease and be a hero by giving the plasma and hopefully, be able to extend the life of someone who’s battling the disease,” he said.
“They have the gift of life in their blood.”
COVID-19 survivor Zubiri donates blood plasma
The PGH has made convalescent plasma therapy available to at least 6 severely or critically ill COVID-19 patients as scientists worldwide continue to develop a cure and a vaccine for the disease.
Three other patients from 2 hospitals received blood plasma from donors who had gone to the PGH.
Of the 6 PGH patients, 1 is now out of intensive care while 3 were “stable and improving.” Two others succumbed to COVID-19.
“There’s no guarantee because in effect, these patients are critically ill. Some of them are really using this plasma therapy as a treatment of last resort,” he said.
The treatment requires consent from patients under the category of “compassionate use.” Plasma is then infused within 21 days from the onset of COVID-19
PGH requires at least 2 weeks of full recovery from donors, as shown by a negative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, the recognized gold standard diagnostic.
They have to weigh at least 50 kilograms and preferably below 60 years ago and without pre-existing medical conditions such as hypertension or diabetes.
“It’s not only enough that you want top donate, but you have to be fit to donate,” said Del Rosario.
If clinical trials later prove that the blood plasma treatment to be efficacious, it could be given to patients with a moderate case of COVID1-9, including those who show no symptoms , he said.
Recovered patients who want to donate blood plasma may call the PGH hotline (155-200) and 09178053207.",abscbn

During the Black Death in the 1300s, one out of every three Europeans perished. The plague was controlled when people quarantined themselves and burned the corpses. After that, they went outdoors again and gathered in big ceremonies.
It was the crowding effect of the Industrial Revolution in the 1700s that caused the rapid spread of TB. Up to 30% of adults in London acquired the disease. Half of the deaths in the English city of Bristol was caused by TB. It was a dreaded airborne disease. I recall that even in my youth, TB was said only in whispers.
Antibiotics, first used for a TB patient in 1949, have made TB less common and made people less and less scared of it. Vaccines have been a great help, too. Even though 1.5 million worldwide still died of TB in 2018, a sick person in the room did not make us scramble for surgical masks. We did not quarantine anyone who was in the same elevator as a TB patient. We knew we had defense and we could get cured.
In 1918, the so-called Spanish flu lasted 36 months and killed “possibly as high as 100 million.” Scientists believe that the flu virus became deadlier because World War l conditions were conducive to bacterial growth.
Today, the same H1N1 virus can be prevented by flu shots. Those who still get it may spend a few days in a hospital but many can get cured at home with good rest, plenty of fluids, and some over-the-counter medicines. Even during recent flu epidemics, we did not close cities down.
With modern medicine, it has been proven that humankind eventually defeats even a mega killer disease. And also slays paranoia.
Before the beginning of the 20th century, when infections and diseases were hard to control, the life expectancy of males was 46 years old. It was 48 years for women. Today, life expectancy is 78.8 years old.
Antibiotics only became commercially available after 1945. Before antibiotics, 90% of children with bacterial meningitis died. Strep throat was considered a fatal disease. A small cut on the skin would get infected and cause death. Every pregnant woman feared the likely event of death after childbirth.
Smallpox and malaria killed more people than all the wars combined. Vaccines have wiped smallpox off the face of the earth. Malaria has already been eradicated in 111 countries.
All I’m saying is that an anti-COVID vaccine and new early warning and early response systems will soon give us the confidence to reopen the malls. We will troop back to cinemas because extra big sights and sounds are not possible at home. We will book flights because humans have been nomadic for 99 percent of our history.
If the not-so-great men of politics will re-channel their war budgets to medicine and health care, the great men and women of science will be better prepared even when a new nasty virus comes along.
They will make sure we will no longer be interrupted if we want to operate factories and run offices, meet in cafes, shoot movies. We will converge in concerts, and sports events, holy masses, and prayer rallies because we crave the energy in large gatherings. We are social animals. We like the herd. Once more, we will clink our glasses, kiss, hug, and take groufie shots.
Nothing will stop humans from being humans.

MANILA—The Food and Drug Administration of the Philippines approved on Friday Clover Biopharmaceuticals’ application for its COVID-19 vaccine trial in the Philippines.
“The FDA also approved the clinical trial for the vaccine developed by Clover Biopharmaceuticals AUS Pty Ltd. today, 08 January 2021,” it said in a statement.
Clover Biopharmaceuticals AUS Pty Ltd. or Clover Australia is the Australian subsidiary of Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Clover Biopharmaceuticals is a global biotechnology company “founded by a team of world-class scientists returning to China.” (Reference: https://www.cloverbiopharma.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=lists&catid=34)
The FDA approval makes Clover the second vaccine developer to get the green light for clinical trials in the country.
The FDA approved the application of Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen last December 28.
“The FDA is currently awaiting response to clarifications for the proposed study on the Sinovac Life Sciences vaccine before issuing a decision on the application,” FDA Director General Eric Domingo said in the statement, referring to the third company that applied for clinical trials in the country.
The FDA said it continues to accept clinical trial applications.
Clinical trials are meant to check the safety and efficacy of vaccines on a larger group of people. Many of those interested in running clinical trials in other countries, such as the Philippines, are already on their Phase 3 trials, involving a large number of participants.
Currently, the World Health Organization lists Clover Biopharmaceuticals as undergoing Phase 2 or 3 clinical trials.
According to the WHO’s draft vaccine landscape document, Clover is working on a protein sub-unit vaccine, which only use one part — such as the spike protein — of the virus to induce an immune response.
A December news release from the company alleged “positive” results for its Phase 1 study.
Besides the 3 mentioned companies seeking independent clinical trials, the WHO is also set to test vaccines in the Philippines.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/28/20/vaccine-efficacy-rate,The efficacy rate and what it really means,"Edson Guido, ABS-CBN Data Analytics",Dec 28 2020 03:42 PM,"A man works in the packaging facility of Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac Biotech, developing an experimental coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine, during a government-organized media tour in Beijing, China, Sept. 24, 2020. Thomas Peter, Reuters/File
The 50% efficacy rate of the Sinovac vaccine from China has made headlines recently.
For the Philippines' Department of Science and Technology, the 50% efficacy is ""acceptable"" given that is the minimum requirement set by the World Health Organization. The Department of Health also agreed, reassuring Filipinos that the Chinese vaccine indeed meets international standards.
Still, many have expressed concern as the reported efficacy of Sinovac lags behind the 95% efficacy rate of Pfizer and the 94% of Moderna's.
Where are we in the COVID-19 vaccine race?
So, what does 50% actually mean? How does it translate to real life? Let’s do the math.
For instance, 50,000 participants in a clinical trial were split evenly between the vaccine and placebo groups. Of the 300 COVID-19 cases that were found, 200 were in the placebo group and only 100 were in the vaccine group. Mathematically, the efficacy rate is then equivalent to a 50% risk reduction. In this particular example, getting a vaccine reduced the infection risk to half of those unvaccinated.
So here is what the efficacy rate means — and what it doesn’t mean.
A 50% efficacy rate indicates that a person is 50% less likely to become infected relative to someone who didn’t get the vaccine.
This does not mean that half of those who took the vaccine won’t get COVID-19 and the other half will. The efficacy rate is always relative to the risk of those who are exposed to the virus.
Because of this, it's important to know the infection risk for those who didn't get the vaccine. If we use the positivity rate of 5% as a proxy (the positivity rate of the Philippines in the last two weeks), then the risk of getting COVID-19 for those who took a vaccine of 50% efficacy is reduced to 2.5%. That is how the math works.
Testing statistics on December 26:- 14,291 tests, less than 15,000 for the 2nd straight day ⬇️
- 805 positives reported by labs
- 6.0% daily positivity rate ⚠️
- 8.4% cumulative positivity rate
- 24 testing backlogs- 529,787 positives (Dec 26)
- 469,886 confirmed (Dec 27) https://t.co/DOgtMk1mQT pic.twitter.com/qfB2UlD6aq — Edson (@EdsonCGuido) December 27, 2020
However, it’s important to note that the efficacy rates were derived from clinical trials that happened under a controlled environment. These conditions may or may not be met in the real world. Hence, it’s possible that there will be a difference between the reported efficacy rates and the effectiveness of the vaccines.
Pfizer and Moderna vaccines need to be stored in lower temperatures to maintain their efficacy and the cold chain infrastructure will be a logistical challenge in some areas. Furthermore, with most COVID-19 vaccines requiring two doses, previous studies have shown that not everyone comes back for the second dose. These are just some of the hurdles that may potentially change efficacy rates in the real world.
To sum, a 50% efficacy rate doesn’t mean that the vaccine only works half of the time. Rather, this rate means the vaccine halved the chances of people who got the vaccine from becoming sick relative to those who didn’t get the vaccine.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/08/21/house-approves-on-final-reading-proposed-law-on-mandatory-immunization,House approves on final reading proposed law on mandatory immunization,"RG Cruz, ABS-CBN News",Feb 08 2021 08:09 PM,"MANILA - Voting 206-1-1, the House of Representatives on Monday approved on final reading a bill providing for a mandatory immunization program.
Under House Bill 8558, the country’s efforts towards disease prevention will be enhanced by expanding the mandatory immunization program for all life stages.
The list of mandatory vaccine preventable diseases include tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, measles, mumps, rubella or German measles, hepatitis b, human influenza type b, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, human papilloma virus and booster for measles, and rubella tetanus.
The proposed law mandates the provision of the vaccine in government hospitals or facilities, any public school or community under its school-based or community-based immunization program, and in any private health facility.
The office of House Health Committee Chair Rep. Angelina “Helen” Tan said in a statement that the bill will repeal Republic Act 10152, otherwise known as the “Mandatory Infants and Children Immunization Act of 2011”, including the list of diseases covered by the national immunization program.
The measure will also include other types of vaccine-preventable diseases as may be determined by the Secretary of Health upon the recommendation of the National Immunization Technical and Advisory Group (NITAG) and after a separate or joint public hearing conducted by the health panels of Congress.
The bill, principally authored by Tan, mandates the Department of Health (DOH) to conduct massive and continuing education and information campaigns on the importance of giving basic immunization in light of the controversy surrounding the dengue vaccine that had somehow tainted the credibility of the government’s immunization program.
“The timing for the approval of this significant health measure cannot be more perfect as the country is looking forward toward the introduction of COVID-19 vaccine, which is likely to become available in the country anytime soon. I am certain that this health legislation will pave the way for a more relevant, responsive, and reinvigorated immunization program that all Filipinos so badly needs at this point,” Tan said.
The bill will be sent to the Senate for action.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/04/01/20/coronavirus-philippines-government-readies-luzon-for-life-after-lockdown,Life after lockdown: Gov't readies Luzon for 'new normal' after quarantine,"Arianne Merez, ABS-CBN News",Apr 01 2020 04:53 PM,"MANILA - Millions in the Philippines will need to adapt to a ""new normal"" at the end of a lockdown to defeat the coronavirus pandemic, government officials said Tuesday as they prepared measures for a post-quarantine scenario.
Luzon, home to roughly half of the Philippines' 100-million population, was placed under a month-long quarantine on March 17 as people were told to stay at home to control the spread of the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19).Other provinces outside the main northern island group have also restricted movement to contain the outbreak.
""It's far from over dahil habang wala pa ngang vaccine ito, ito na nga 'yung sinasabi nating new normal (while there is no vaccine yet, this is what we call the new normal),"" Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said Wednesday.
Officials have yet to say whether the lifting of the lockdown will push through as scheduled on April 13 as it leaves the assessment to a technical working group led by the Department of Health.
The National Economic and Development Authority, meanwhile, is leading efforts ""to revive consumer and business confidence even sooner,"" said Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto Pernia.
Millions of poor families for the meantime are dependent on relief aid while waiting for a cash subsidy from the national government.

Among options being considered by the government is a barangay or village-based quarantine to pave the way for a gradual lifting of the lockdown.
Under such scenario, the reopening of essential businesses such as those involved in the supply chain of food products, medical products, and other necessities will be prioritized, according to Trade Secretary Ramon Lopez.
""Gradual muna, importante mabalik 'yung mga negosyo na kailangan magtuloy para po may hanapbuhay ang ating mga kababayan, again following the new norm, 'yung social distancing,"" he said.
(It should be gradual. It's important for businesses to resume operations so that people can go to work, again following the new norm, social distancing.)

Once businesses are allowed to resume, Lopez said companies must adopt a ""new culture,"" which includes physical distancing and avoiding mass gatherings.
Marketing, construction and public transportation should also resume with safeguards to prevent the spread of COVID-19, said Presidential Adviser on Entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion.
""The goal really is while we have to be guarded against the virus, we have to start reviving the economy. We might kill the virus but we might die because the economy is floundering. That's the biggest challenge we're facing right now,"" Concepcion said.
QUARANTINE FACILITIES

More Filipinos are expected to be tested for COVID-19 in the coming days after the health department announced that it could now run 1,000 tests a day from the previous daily average of 300.
With more cases of the disease expected to be confirmed in the coming days, Nograles said the government is preparing a system of segregation to isolate patients who will test positive for COVID-19 and patients under investigation (PUIs).
The government is turning its convention centers into ""fully-functional"" quarantine facilities. It is also looking at ships and hotels as alternative quarantine sites, as more hospitals become overwhelmed with the rising number of COVID-19 cases.
In 10 days, the Philippine International Convention Center, World Trade Center, and the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex will be converted into quarantine facilities.Each region, meanwhile, has prepared a hotel that could be dedicated as an exclusive COVID-19 quarantine facility.
Nograles explained that the government is planning to allot hospitals for COVID-19 patients who are in a severe or critical state to ensure adequate medical treatment.
Those who will test positive for the disease but will exhibit mild symptoms, meanwhile, will be isolated ""as a group"" to avoid overcrowding in hospitals, he said.
""We have to make sure that the hospital bed capacity is intact...We have to prioritize severe and critical patients,"" Nograles added.
Patients under investigation or those who have symptoms of the disease but are still waiting for their test results have to be isolated in a facility fit for ""single-room occupancy,"" Nograles said.
As for persons under monitoring, or those who were exposed to COVID-19 patients but are still asymptomatic, the Cabinet official said the government is also looking for a way to isolate them from the public.
""Ang gusto lang po natin ma-manage ay 'yung hindi siya kakalat ng ganoon ka-widespread at lahat ng mahahawa ng COVID-19 ay naaalagaan natin at mas madami tayong recovery kaysa death,"" Nograles said.
(We want to manage the spread of the disease. We want to ensure that everyone who gets infected with COVID-19 will be taken care of. We want more recoveries than deaths.)
TRANSITION
But even if the government sets up massive quarantine facilities and lifts the lockdown, Filipinos still need to be wary of the possibility of getting infected with COVID-19 since there is no available vaccine or cure for the disease yet.
""Kahit mag-transition na tayo doon sa new normal, kailangan naka-implement pa 'yung mga social distancing measures. Kailangan maingat pa rin tayo dahil habang nandiyan pa yung threat ng COVID-19 at wala pa pong vaccine, kailangan lagi po tayong mag-iingat,"" Nograles said.
(Even as we transition to the new normal, we have to still implement social distancing measures. We need to be careful because as long as the COVID-19 threat is there and there is no vaccine, we always need to be careful.)
For now, government policy is erring on the side of caution as it depends on science to guide its next move.
""It will be based on science. It will be based on numbers. It will be based on facts and figures and it would totally depend on the cooperation of everybody,"" Nograles said.",abscbn
https://news.abs-cbn.com/blogs/business/12/14/20/covid-19-is-not-going-away-even-with-a-vaccine,COVID-19 is not going away,Aneth Ng-Lim,Dec 14 2020 10:12 AM,"News of successful COVID-19 vaccine trials came one after another, and with the governments around the world now releasing their stamps of approval, it seems we have finally turned a corner in this global pandemic.
I can’t help but wonder if this is why nearly all the shopping malls are attracting huge crowds these days. Could the optimism from these developments embolden the Filipinos to leave their homes and resume their pre-pandemic lives?
I was initially blaming the 12.12 sale but the truth is even before this red-letter date, social media chat groups were reporting shoppers failing to observe physical distancing. When you see the number of people packed in confined spaces, I can understand why social distancing is not followed. But aren’t we still under community quarantine with crowd control protocols to ensure physical distancing is always possible?
If you are one of those eager to line up for the vaccine as soon as it reaches Philippine shores, please consider what medical experts are also saying.
The Washington Post (WP) spoke to experts in epidemiology, disaster planning and vaccine development and they all say that even after vaccines are deployed, COVID-19 will likely remain for decades to come. “Experts call such diseases endemic — stubbornly resisting efforts to stamp them out. Think measles, HIV, chickenpox,” says the WP report featured in its dedicated section for Coronavirus coverage.
Things are not going to get better overnight, but in the long haul, the situation should improve. This will need several things to happen such as more people getting infected, people’s bodies adapting to the virus, and immunity to COVID-19 spreading by natural means and medical intervention.
Sarah Cobey, an epidemiologist and evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, who was interviewed in the same WP report raised a key question that should all be top of our mind: “This virus is here to stay. The question is, how do we live with it safely?”
Here are 10 things you can do to protect yourself, your loved ones living with you, and to arrest the spread of the virus (and still squeeze in some holiday shopping and pre-COVID 19 life activities):
#1 Wear a mask.Yes, it’s uncomfortable. Breathing is constricted. And if you have to wear it all day at work, you can feel suffocated. But I recommend reading stories of patients who were infected with COVID-19, or watching YouTube videos of the same topic and that should make you realize wearing a mask is a small price to pay to keep breathing.
#2 Add on a face shield.
Wearing a face shield on top of a face mask is just like the two-factor authentication now required by banks if you want to access your account. You need your log-in password plus a one-time PIN. It can be a hassle but it keeps your money safe from fraudsters.
Face masks can get dislodged or maybe you want a few seconds break from wearing it. The face shield can keep you safe if these happen. And even if they don’t, covering your eyes and mouth – two confirmed entry points for the virus – is always the safest for you.
#3 Avoid contact as much as you can.
Crossing the street? Avoid pressing the crosswalk button and just wait for the traffic signal to change. Entering stores? Wait for the guard to open the doors or pick entry points with automated doors. Going down the escalator? Try to keep your balance without holding on to the rails.#4 No to confined spaces.
Good air circulation will help ensure you don’t get infected and this is something lacking in confined spaces. If you are just going up one to two to three floors, better to take the stairs than be stuck inside an elevator box. Waiting for an appointment and the lobby area is small? Offer to wait outside and have them call you when they are ready for you.
#5 Always carry sanitizers.
A small spray bottle of sanitizer or alcohol can help you keep your sanity if you do end up in contact with a public door handle, use a public bathroom, or must ride an elevator to go up 15 floors. ATM machines are another red flag but we all need cash so be ready to spray away. Or you can always ask the bank personnel to sanitize for you before use.
#6 Keep it under 30 minutes.
With so few interactions with family and friends, when we do see them, we get so excited that time flies by. But the medical recommendation is to limit physical meetings to 30 minutes or less. This holds true for work meetings, and personal errands as well. Anything that requires you to stay longer than this is a warning sign that you are endangering yourself, and everyone around you.
#7 Keep your 1-meter distance, or more if you can.
Some places have distancing guidelines that are helpful to know where you should stay and where the others around you should stand. But not all areas have the same floor stickers or markings so try to measure at home what your 1 meter is like and remember it visually. It’s usually more than an arm’s length so when you can see someone crossing that line you know you have to step back.
#8 Discover digital payments.
If you haven’t discovered it yet, it’s time to switch to digital banking and digital payments. Paper bills and coins can cause the virus to spread faster as these change hands many times in a day. Choose a digital partner based on your bank of account so the onboarding will be easier for you. Always check the fees – I’ve been using digital banking for some time now and have avoided paying cash in and cash out fees. The trick is to choose the right channels to cash in and cash in (some outlets are free, and some are not) and to do it in the right amounts.
#9 Shop online.
12.12 sales proved to me again that shopping online can be a smarter move for your wallet. For the same brand, I learned that their physical stores did not offer the sales available in their online shop – and that’s a 20% discount! Many offer free shipping too so you save on transportation, plus the cost of your disposable face mask by staying home and letting your fingers do the buying.
#10 Organize virtual get-togethers.
Nine out of 10, people say they leave their homes because they need to see other people and mingle with humanity. Why not try virtual get-togethers for now? Chances are you are not the only one missing your family and friends and your invitation will be welcomed.The WP report pointed out that “living long-term with the virus also means addressing the mental health effects.” Depression and anxiety are problems facing not only medical front liners, but also teachers, students, and all sectors badly hit by the pandemic and the ensuing lockdown. “The psychological recovery is going to be as important as economic and logistical parts of this.”

A Filipina Harvard scientist is among a team of international scientists that cracked the code in newborn immunity.
Filipino-American vaccine scientist Joann Diray Arce is part of the team that successfully studied the blood from a number of baby subjects.
For the first time, the international research team mapped the pathway in the newborn's life in their first week of life. This is a breakthrough in understanding how to protect babies from infection and optimize the function of vaccines in early life.
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2017, 5.4 million deaths, or roughly 47 percent of all under-five deaths, occur during the first 28-days of life.This translates to 7000 newborn deaths every day worldwide with 34,000 of deaths in the Philippines in the year 2015 alone.

https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/08/18/coa-state-childrens-hospitals-dengvaxia-procurement-violated-regulations,COA: State children's hospital's Dengvaxia procurement violated regulations,"Adrian Ayalin, ABS-CBN News",May 08 2018 05:35 PM,"MANILA - The Commission on Audit (COA) has told the Philippine Children’s Medical Center (PCMC) to strictly adhere to government procurement requirements after the controversial purchase of P3-billion worth of anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia during the Aquino administration was found to have violated state regulations.In its annual audit report on the PCMC, the COA noted that the hospital's purchase of the vaccine for the Department of Health (DOH), then under the administration of Health Secretary Janette Garin, was not in accordance with existing rules.
“The procurement of dengue tetravalent vaccine amounting to P3 billion [was] not in accordance with the implementing rules and regulations of Executive Order No. 49., the revised implementing rules and regulations of Republic Act No. 9184 (Government Procurement Reform Act) and the memorandum of agreement by and between the DOH and PCMC,” the COA said.
The report was released as Garin, former President Benigno Aquino III, former Budget Secretary Butch Abad, and former Executive Secretary Paquito Ochoa faced several charges over the nationwide dengue immunization program initiated in April 2016.The charges followed French drug maker Sanofi Pasteur's warning in November that Dengvaxia may cause severe dengue symptoms on those inoculated who had never contracted the mosquito-borne disease.The COA noted that the issuance of the exemption recommended by the Formulary Executive Council (FEC), which should have been submitted to the National Center for Pharmaceutical Access and Management (NCPAM), was instead submitted to Garin.The COA said the PCMC reasoned that Garin also had the authority as the then health secretary to exempt the vaccine from guidelines under the 1993 executive order.“Management informed that the exemption from EO 49 for the dengue vaccine was recommended by the FEC and approved by the DOH secretary, who exercises administrative supervision and control over the NCPAM,” the COA said.
The audit agency also said that the shelf life of the vaccines as indicated in the purchase order did not conform with the provisions of the terms of reference for the procurement process.The PCMC had created a technical working group for the procurement, which required a shelf life of 18 to 24 months upon delivery, but the purchase order only had a 1-year expiration period for the drug.“On the shelf life of the dengue vaccine per purchase order, management argued that the statement in the PO (purchase order) that all deliveries shall have at least one year expiration period is a mere inadvertence,” the COA said.
The COA, however, admitted that their annual audit report on the dengue vaccines may be moot and academic, but it is for future procurement to be made by PCMC.
“The inclusion in this AAR (annual audit report) of the said audit observations is to ensure that implementation of future projects/programs/transactions of similar nature be dealt with proper caution and the due observance of laws/rules/regulations governing the transactions,” the COA said.
The PCMC, headed by Dr. Julius Lecciones, had said during the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee inquiry on deaths supposedly related to Dengvaxia that he was only instructed by Garin to procure the vaccines.
The committee found Aquino, Garin, Abad, and Lecciones liable for alleged violation of several laws.

The former officials earlier insisted that the increasing number of dengue cases justified their purchase of the vaccine when there were no conclusive studies yet on the risks it posed.
More than 830,000 school children were immunized under the state vaccination program, which was terminated in December following Sanofi's advisory on Dengvaxia's risks.Philippines suspends dengue vaccine program after Sanofi warns of risks

MANILA, Philippines -- (UPDATED) Deputy Speaker Mikee Romero of 1-Pacman partylist on Tuesday filed a resolution that will give elite Filipino athletes priority in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.
Speaking at the Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA) Forum on Tuesday morning, Romero said Filipino athletes -- particularly those who will compete in Olympic qualifiers in the coming months -- must be treated as frontliners.
""Today, I'm doing a House resolution to prioritize the Philippine athletes, especially itong mga lumalaban sa SEA Games as well as the Tokyo Olympics … na dapat bigyan sila ng vaccination,"" said Romero, also the head of the country's polo federation and owner of the NorthPort franchise in the PBA.
According to Romero, the vaccines should be available by March, with medical frontliners as well as members of the military and the police among those first in line to receive the jabs.
However, he wants the elite athletes who will represent the country in international events this year to also be among those prioritized.
""I'll put a resolution today, making our athletes as part of those frontliners, para mauna sila, ma-prioritize silang mabigyan ng mga vaccine,"" he said, stressing that these are the athletes who will compete in the Tokyo Olympics and the Southeast Asian Games later this year.
""Ang athletes natin, especially ang elite athletes, give so much pride to our country, and in fact lumalaban din sila,"" he explained. ""So kumbaga, kailangang tawagin din silang frontliner because of their sacrifices sa bansa natin.""
He filed House Resolution No. 1507 on Tuesday afternoon, which urges the Inter-Agency Task Force and appropriate government agencies ""to classify national athletes who are vying for a slot in the upcoming Tokyo Olympics and Southeast Asian Games as frontliners, to prioritize their vaccination against COVID-19.""
""It is imperative that our national athletes should be classified as frontliners, in order to prioritize their vaccination against COVID-19 in the soonest possible time, to ensure that they will be allowed to participate in the qualifying stages,"" said Romero in his resolution, noting that qualifying events will be held as early as April.

In the PSA Forum, Romero said he will coordinate with the Philippine Sports Commission and the Philippine Olympic Committee on how to vaccinate the elite athletes, some of whom are currently training at the Inspire Sports Facility in Calamba, Laguna.
Others, like weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, are training abroad ahead of their qualifying tournaments.Four Filipino athletes have already qualified to the Tokyo Games -- boxers Irish Magno and Eumir Marcial, pole vaulter EJ Obiena, and gymnast Carlos Yulo.

It was supposed to be a hectic week in domestic sports.The Season 82 finals in UAAP women’s volleyball would have been underway, as other university competitions wound down. The PBA, celebrating its 45th season, would have been at the midpoint of its centerpiece conference, the Philippine Cup. The top junior athletes throughout the country would have been a day away from participating in the annual Palarong Pambansa in Marikina.Throughout the country, athletic events would have gone on as they have had for months, years, decades.
Until the novel coronavirus 2019 pandemic happened.
“It’s safe to say nobody really expected it to be of this magnitude,” said UAAP executive director Rebo Saguisag.
Ramon “Tats” Suzara, chief organizer of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, said he doesn’t think anybody in the sports world — internationally and locally — was prepared.“This is very unique,” Suzara said. “Kasi sa mga regulations ng sports federation merong (measures) ‘in case of typhoon, earthquake’ but it never mentioned about pandemic. So I think they will make amendments now.”
The health crisis was so fluid that, in a matter of weeks leagues and sports bodies, which stopped competitions outright, are now looking toward a grimmer scenario if they haven’t decided on it already — stopping any form of organized sports activity for the rest of the year.
PSC cancels sports events, assures support for national athletes
The Philippine Sports Commission on Wednesday officially became the first national sports institution to announce shutting down its events.
“Bago nag-lockdown, tiningnan namin ang mga nagkansela ng kompetisyon sa buong mundo. Reason will really say na we have to cancel our events up to December,” said PSC chairman William “Butch” Ramirez.
Leagues, meanwhile, remain optimistic that they wouldn’t have to make such a drastic decision, but still they wouldn’t hesitate to go that route if needed.PBA commissioner Willie Marcial said, “We’re playing it by ear.”
If government eases community restrictions and there’s a clear directive that the PBA can resume activities, he would reopen team practices first, Marcial said. The league played one game in its new season — San Miguel Beer vs. Magnolia on March 8 — before altogether folding the Philippine Cup.Even with the lockdown in Metro Manila extended to May 15, Marcial said a June or July opening for a two-conference season can be worked on, or September for one conference.
“Kung papayagan pa (ng gobyerno) at kung may vaccine, pero kailan pa darating sa’tin ’yon?” said Marcial, who added that he knows vaccines won’t be available until later this year, the earliest.“Kung hindi pa rin pe-pwede, ika-cancel na natin ang 45th season. No choice tayo. ’Yun ang masakit, pero wala naman tayo magagawa.”
PBA: Pagkansela ng 45th season posible ba? Kung magtagal ang pandemic pwede, ani kume
After terminating Season 82 in response to the so-called enhanced community quarantine in Luzon, Saguisag said “Plan A” is to get the league going in September, still around the same time the UAAP typically launches its season, though a January 2021 opening is possible, too, he said.
“But really we don’t know what’s going to happen. We’re dependent on what the government will say,” Saguisag said.
COVID-19’s potency isn’t lost on sports officials, who are aware that massive crowds go hand in hand with athletic events, the same kind of environment in which the virus thrives but the government bent on flattening the curve can’t allow to happen.
Ramirez said his office recognized that, amid the extended inactivity and in these dire times, the health of athletes and coaches goes beyond their physical bodies.
“We’ve instructed our sports psychologists and doctors to set up an online sports guidance counselling sa mga atleta sa kani-kaniyang probinsya regarding their fears and anxiety,” the PSC chief said.
Given that the disease presents so many unknowns, stakeholders, if it were up to them, would rather wait for a vaccine to arrive before returning to action.“Walang vaccine, walang solusyon talaga sa coronavirus,” Ramirez said.“Wala munang assembly of people more than 10 (people), so how can you play, have a sports event? Magkakahawa ang mga athlete.”
DOH: COVID-19 cases in PH breach 8,000-mark; recoveries now at 1,023
As of Wednesday, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the Philippines is at 8,212, according to the Department of Health, with 254 new cases.
Thus far, there have been 558 deaths and 1,023 recoveries overall.
Like Ramirez and Marcial, Saguisag acknowledged nobody would want to gamble on people’s lives.
“Kung ako, personally, we may not be returning for a while,” Saguisag said.
“The consequence just far outweighs the benefit. To gather that many people, it will accelerate the spread.”

Tolentino said Tuesday that he expects the Philippine delegation to Tokyo to be composed of 100 persons at the maximum, and that it will be ""very doable"" for the POC to procure vaccines for all of them.""Tuloy lang ang mga atleta, huwag manghihinaan ng loob,"" Tolentino said at the first Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA) Forum session of the year.""And, of course, with the vaccine in sight, kaya ngang mag-procure ng POC ng vaccine kung tutuusin for those Olympic-bound.

The Philippines currently has four qualifiers to the Tokyo Olympics -- pole vaulter EJ Obiena, gymnast Carlos Yulo, and boxers Eumir Marcial and Irish Magno. Sports officials are projecting that at least 11 more Filipino athletes can secure berths in the Summer Games.
Counting the athletes' coaches and national sports officials, Tolentino believes the Philippine delegation to Tokyo will reach 100 persons.
""Doable, kayang-kaya,"" the congressman said of providing vaccines for all of them.The budget should not be an issue, according to Tolentino, even if they procure vaccines for all national athletes and coaches, and not just those who are heading to the Tokyo Olympics.
""Kung Sinovac na P2,900, that's only P2.9 (million),"" he said. ""We're talking of 1,000 (pesos). If we're talking of 10,000 athletes, that's only P10 (million). Very doable 'yun. Hindi pinag-uusapan ang pambayad.""
""Definitely, kung para sa athletes 'yun, there will be some sponsors on this,"" he added. ""Kaya ng POC and other stakeholders, kayang-kaya. Kasi ang pinakamahal nga niyan, P2,900. Pero iba P1,000, 'yung iba P500, 'yung iba P600. So definitely, kaya.""
The bigger concern is the supply of the vaccine, he admitted. At the moment, the national government has yet to announce which brand of vaccine will be procured. Several local government units, however, have already set their own budgets to purchase doses of the vaccine.
This will help in providing vaccines for national athletes, said Tolentino.
""Like what other LGUs pronounced, like Makati -- if you're living in Makati, free lahat 'yung vaccine mo. So kung meron tayong 300 athletes na taga roon, definitely covered na 'yun,"" he pointed out.In case the national government cannot provide the vaccine in time, Tolentino said they are ready to work with the private sector, including Joey Concepcion of RFM Corporation and the Ayala Corporation.
""Pwede tayong maki-usap na pwede kaming sumulat, ang POC, na can we get a portion for the (athletes),"" said Tolentino. ""Not only for Tokyo-bound but for the qualifiers. It's a matter of 200 pieces, 'di naman lalampas sa ganoon.""""And 200 pieces, kinompute ko na kanina, it's only how much, 'di ba? Doable,"" he stressed.Related video:",abscbn

Naredo, ABS-CBN News",Feb 03 2021 05:17 PM,"MANILA, Philippines -- Alaska veteran Sonny Thoss is willing to return to the PBA, but only once a vaccine for COVID-19 is available.
This, according to Alaska team governor Dickie Bachmann, who revealed that Thoss is still open to a comeback after retiring in September 2020.
""There are some players that are willing to play 'pag may vaccine,"" Bachmann said in a press conference recently. ""One example is Sonny Thoss. He's just waiting for a vaccine so he can play again.""
This is an about-face for Thoss, who initially decided to retire after 15 seasons in the PBA last September. The 39-year-old big man had reportedly opted against renewing his contract with Alaska, which expired in August 2020.
Thoss spent his entire career with the Aces after being drafted fifth overall in 2004.
The PBA has partnered with the Philippine Red Cross to procure vaccines for its teams.
In an appearance on ""Coaches Unfiltered,"" Alaska coach Jeff Cariaso acknowledged that while Thoss has not yet retired officially, he is ""in limbo.""
""Sonny will most likely not play again because I don't think the vaccine will be here on time,"" he admitted. ""Until that's really clear, and we get the go-signal from our team doctor soon, I don't anticipate seeing Sonny.""
""So unfortunately, he won't probably be with us again, at least for this conference,"" he added.
But Cariaso is still hopeful that Thoss will be able to suit up for Alaska at some point, especially as they want to give him a ""proper sendoff.""Thoss had been the Aces' pillar of strength throughout his career, and he helped them win three championships. He was the Finals MVP of Alaska's most recent title in the 2013 PBA Commissioner's Cup.
""We want to give him the proper sendoff, that's just one more conference,"" said Cariaso. ""(The last conference) didn't work out the way we wanted to. So we'll see.""

“Inatasan ako ng board na kumuha ng vaccine through Red Cross. Sa mga teams, halos lahat ng teams, at baka kasama families,” Marcial said in a press briefing.

“So ganoon ang gagawin natin, so susulat ako sa Red Cross, kay Senator (Richard) Gordon na x amount of vaccine ang ire-request.”
Marcial said by reaching out to the Red Cross the league could get AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines, but previous reports said the nonprofit group has only been engaged in talks with AstraZeneca and Pfizer.

A vaccine would go a long way in ensuring the PBA doesn’t play a truncated season the way it did in 2020 and that the 12 clubs don’t bleed any more money.Marcial added that COVID-19 shots were needed, too, if PBA teams want to participate in the East Asia Super League.Last August, the PBA held discussions with EASL organizers, after it signed a 10-year deal with FIBA to run an annual league for the top professional clubs in East Asia and the Philippines.
PBA teams have regularly participated in EASL competitions since it was founded in 2016, with NLEX, San Miguel Beer, Blackwater, and TNT Tropang Giga among the squads to have played in the Terrific 12 tournament as part of their preseason preparations.
But EASL events will have a new format now that it has partnered with FIBA Asia.In October 2021, it will launch a new competition, where the region's top 8 teams will compete in a home-and-away group stage. It will culminate in a final 4 in February to determine the champion, runner-up, and third-place team.
With the pandemic, the 2 leagues' plans could change.
According to Marcial, he has spoken to PBA team representatives and they agreed a vaccine must be in play first before they go ahead with competition.“Naka-hold muna the decision to join East Asia hanggang wala pang vaccine,” Marcial said.
“Kapag andiyan na ang vaccine, mag-uusap ulit kami with East Asia. Hindi namin kino-close 'yung door.”RELATED VIDEO

Naredo, ABS-CBN News",Jan 14 2021 06:08 PM,"PSC Commissioner Ramon Fernandez watches a PBA game in 2018. PBA Media Bureau.
MANILA, Philippines -- Ramon Fernandez, the newly-appointed chef de mission to the 2021 Southeast Asian Games, vowed to do his best to work around the pandemic as Filipino athletes gear up to defend their crown in the regional event.
Team Philippines dominated the 2019 edition of the SEA Games at home, winning a record 149 gold medals to secure the overall championship for the first time in 14 years.
Repeating that feat appears to be a tall task, however, as the Philippines is still gripped by the COVID-19 pandemic. Athletes have been restricted from training in person for several months, although members of the karate, boxing, and taekwondo teams are set to enter the Inspire Sports Academy in Calamba, Laguna for a camp this weekend.
""It's still touch and go at this moment,"" Fernandez said of the preparations for the SEA Games during an appearance on ""Usapang Sports on Air"" on Thursday.
""I really feel that without the vaccine, it's pretty hard to prepare our athletes the normal way of preparing them for such a big international competition,"" he explained.""But we will do our best,"" Fernandez promised.
Fernandez stressed that preparation will be the key to Filipino athletes' success in the 2021 SEA Games, which is scheduled for November 21 to December 2 in Hanoi, Vietnam. He pointed out that ahead of the 2019 edition of the event, several members of Team Philippines were able to train and compete abroad to gear up for the SEA Games.
Doing so would be ""doubly or even triply hard"" this year, Fernandez admitted. Overseas travel remains restricted, especially with a more infectious variant of COVID-19 being reported.
""But we will be working closely with the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force) and the DOH (Department of Health) and the other agencies on hand, trying to control this pandemic,"" he said.
""We'll do our best, we'll adjust to the situation,"" Fernandez added. ""But the key is the vaccine.""
According to Fernandez, PSC chairman William ""Butch"" Ramirez is working with the relevant agencies to ensure that Filipino athletes will be among those prioritized for the COVID-19 vaccine.
Once vaccinated, Fernandez is confident that Team Philippines can prepare in a more ""normal"" way, rather than settling for the virtual sessions that they have been doing for most of 2020.Fernandez will meet with the leadership of the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) at the end of the month to map the pathway to the 2021 SEA Games.
""We will take everything into consideration, just to prepare these athletes for the SEA Games. That's really going to be the key,"" he said. ""No matter what it takes, we'll try our best.""
""We'll work around COVID. I'm hoping na magkaroon na ng vaccine in May or June man lang, ma-prioritize natin ang mga atleta so they can go back to their normal training in preparation for the SEA Games,"" he said.
Fernandez, also a commissioner with the PSC, is banking on the lessons he has learned from Ramirez who was the chef de mission to the 2019 SEA Games.
""It's going to be a challenging mission, considering that champion tayo the last time,"" he said.
""But this is about the athletes. Games like this are all about the athletes. It's not about the officials who's running them,"" he stressed. ""If we come together and support our athletes, I think we will also give a good performance in the coming SEA Games.""

MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) will try to acquire the COVID-19 vaccine and donate them to those in need, commissioner Willie Marcial has revealed.
Marcial said Tuesday that he will propose to the Board of Governors for the league to give away the COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes available.
""Ang balak nga namin, sasabihin ko rin sa Board, na kumuha rin kami ng vaccine, at para makapamigay din tayo,"" said Marcial during the Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA) Forum.
""Mabigyan din natin 'yung frontliners, or makapag-donate tayo ng mga vaccine, kung papayagan tayong bumili o papayagan tayo ng government,"" he added. ""Makabigay din ng vaccine sa mga nangangailangan.""
Marcial clarified that this plan still depends on the government, but if they are allowed, the league will not hesitate to donate to those in need.
""Hindi pa nga namin alam kung magkano ang bakuna. Two, hindi ko pa alam kung papayagan kami ng government or 'yung Pfizer man 'yan o Moderna,"" he explained.
""Ang gusto ko lang, sa akin, mabigyan 'yung mga nangangailangan. Frontliners, mga matatanda, 'yung mga nasa mahihirap na lugar. Hindi ko masabi, hindi ko pa alam kung magkano,"" he added.
The government is currently in negotiations with Novavax, and the country expects to receive 30 million doses of Covovax, Novavax Inc's COVID-19 vaccine, by July next year.

Speaking to PTV4 on Monday afternoon, PSC chairman William ""Butch"" Ramirez said the agency is crafting protocols to follow when the country shifts to the general community quarantine come May 16, as well as when a vaccine is developed for COVID-19.""We have to be very, very careful na from ECQ (enhanced community quarantine), sa May 16 magiging GCQ, what will be the protocol of sports,"" said Ramirez. ""We will be recommending to the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force) on some protocols.""
""Magbabago lahat 'yan. Ang PSC at this time is now crafting a protocol, the so-called protocol of the GCQ, the protocol when the vaccine comes, and the protocol when everything is (under the) new normal,"" he said.

One change that they are likely to implement is long-distance coaching.
""We plan to talk to the National Sports Associations and the Philippine Olympic Committee to be able to set up a program where coaches can continue to coach athletes who are in their provinces through teleconference,"" Ramirez explained.
Athletes will also need to change their habits in order to stay safe, he said.""You can no longer use a towel na ginagamit ng isang atleta. You can no longer use a bed linen na ginagamit ng atleta,"" he added.
""There are communal areas like swimming pool, bathrooms, canteen, etc. Disinfections and the preparation will really change our habits in the future,"" he further said.
Ramirez believes that individual sports, such as athletics and singles tennis and table tennis, may return gradually, but it will take longer for team sports to be allowed to take place again.
""'Pag dumating ang vaccine at parang normal na, gradual rin 'yung pagbabalik sa team sports, because the most important thing for one institution like sports, it has to adhere and follow the directions of the national government through the IATF,"" he stressed.""Kahit gusto man ng Philippine sports na magkaroon ng singles or solo (events), kung ayaw ng IATF, maiintindihan po namin 'yan kasi we have to take care of each life of a Filipino,"" he added.The PSC has already cancelled all events for the rest of 2020, including the country's hosting of the ASEAN Para Games, as part of its ""belt-tightening measures"" due to the pandemic.(For more sports coverage, visit the ABS-CBN Sports website).",abscbn

MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippines' chef de mission to the upcoming Tokyo Olympics is ready to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to reassure athletes about its safety.
This, even though vaccination is not mandatory for athletes and other delegates bound for the Tokyo Games in July.
""Hindi naman mandatory, but it is advised by the IOC (International Olympic Committee) na kung puwede, magpa-vaccinate 'yung mga athletes,"" said Mariano ""Nonong"" Araneta, the country's chef-de-mission to the Games, in an appearance on ""The Chasedown"" last Saturday.
""Dito naman sa atin, we're trying our best na … magkaroon ng vaccines ang athletes,"" he added. ""Hopefully by May, magkakaroon na tayo ng vaccine.""
However, confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine in the Philippines remains an issue. On Sunday, the Department of Interior and Local Government reported that only three out of 10 individuals in Metro Manila are willing to be vaccinated.
At least one athlete who is hopeful of qualifying to the Tokyo Olympics has also expressed their misgivings about the COVID-19 vaccine, citing potential side effects.
Araneta is ready to get vaccinated, however, in order to boost the athletes' confidence in the process.
""Siyempre ako, magpa-vaccine ako para makita nila,"" he said.
Araneta, also the president of the Philippine Football Federation (PFF), further revealed that they have placed an order of the COVID-19 vaccine for football players and officials.
Philippine sports officials have pushed for athletes -- particularly those who are going to the Olympics and Olympic qualifying tournaments -- to be vaccinated.
Deputy speaker Mikee Romero, also the owner of the NorthPort franchise in the PBA, has filed a resolution that will give elite Filipino athletes priority in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine.Meanwhile, Philippine Olympic Committee president Rep. Abraham ""Bambol"" Tolentino announced recently that business tycoon Enrique Razon, chairman of the International Container Terminal Services, Inc., has agreed to provide the country's Olympic-bound athletes and coaches with the COVID-19 vaccine.

Mayor Marcy Teodoro showed NTF deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon the vaccination system the city plans to roll out, which gets rid of pre-registration processes, such as screenings for co-morbidities and allergies to be done on the barangay level.
“Napakaganda noon kasi ibig sabihin bibilis ang proseso at hindi masyadong mabibilaukan ang pila. At ang isa pang maganda dito, open, mas hindi prone sa transmission. Kapag open air hindi kamukha ng iba na air-conditioned at hindi kalakahin ang area, madali i-expand and napaka-organized,” Dizon said.

Teodoro said that besides the city’s sports center there will be 9 other vaccination centers at schools as they target 10,000 daily inoculations.
The vaccination process will start with the registration of pre-screened individuals, actual vaccination and observation if they will exhibit adverse reactions.
Following the national guidelines, frontliners in Marikina hospitals will be the first to receive the vaccines that will come from national government.
Teodoro said the city’s own vaccine procurement will arrive in the third quarter of the year, adding an indemnification fund will be set aside by the city government.
“Initially meron kaming P5 (million) to P6 million. Ito 'yung for financial and medical assistance kung sakaling magkaroon ng adverse reaction, kasi kailangan din para sa tiwala ng tao. Alam niya pag magkasakit siya meron siya maaasahan na pondo or budget,” Teodoro said.
Marikina residents who participated in the simulation activity said they were looking forward to their actual vaccination against COVID-19.
“Mas maganda po totohanan na ibigay na vaccine, mas protektado ang bawat tao at least may panlaban na sa virus ang bayan ng Marikina, maging COVID-free kami,” said resident Lyma Rico.

Basketball legend Ramon Fernandez, now a commissioner with the Philippine Sports Commission (PSC), admits that he is unsure as to when events in the grassroots level can return, given the COVID-19 situation in the country.""Dependent talaga tayo kay COVID, kung anong gusto niyang mangyari,"" Fernandez said during a recent appearance on the ""PSC Hour.""
The PSC was forced to cancel several events in 2020, including the Philippine National Games, the Batang Pinoy, and the Palarong Pambansa. Regional sports events were also scrapped as Filipinos observed strict restrictions to curb the spread of the virus.It was a disappointing development for Fernandez, who was looking forward to implementing programs in the grassroots level last year.
""We are ready and our programs are in place,"" he said, noting that the PSC was prepared to ""really concentrate on the grassroots program"" in 2020 while the various national sports associations handled the elite athletes.Because of the pandemic, however, those programs did not get off the ground. In contrast, professional sports were allowed to return in October 2020, with the PBA eventually completing its All-Filipino Conference in a bubble in Clark, Pampanga. The country's Olympic hopefuls, meanwhile, begin training this weekend in another bubble at the Inspire Sports Academy in Calamba, Laguna.
READ: Everything in place for national athletes training in bubble: PSC
Fernandez said the return of grassroots programs and events such as the Palarong Pambansa will ultimately depend on the pandemic and how the country deals with it. As of Tuesday afternoon, there was a total of 491,258 reported cases in the Philippines, of which 23,532 were active.
""We're hoping everything will normalize. Not until the vaccine comes along, mahirap talagang mag-umpisa again sa grassroots program,"" he said in a separate interview on ""Power and Play"" with former PBA commissioner Noli Eala.
""Si COVID lang ang makakatulong sa atin, kung tumigil na siya. There's really not much we can do about it, to put it bluntly,"" Fernandez added. ""As I said, not until the vaccine comes along can we go back to our normal lives as far as athletic programs are concerned.""
Aside from grassroots events, the Philippines' collegiate leagues were also heavily impacted by the pandemic. Both the NCAA and the UAAP cancelled their seasons in April 2020, and the UAAP recently announced that it will not push through with Season 83. It remains to be seen if the NCAA will hold Season 96 this year.Related video:",abscbn

Lord Allan Velasco as House Speaker in a sports club was deemed ""unconstitutional"" by a law expert on Monday, hours after Taguig Pateros Rep. Alan Peter Cayetano was ""ousted"" from the House leadership.
Lawmakers vote to install Velasco as House Speaker
Former UP Law Dean and constitutionalist Pacifico Agabin said that the installation of Velasco at the Celebrity Sports Plaza in Quezon City with a version of the House mace, the symbol of the authority of the chamber which should be present during sessions, violated a provision of the Constitution.
He explained that under Paragraph 5, Section 16 of Article 6, ""neither House during the sessions of the Congress shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.""
Agabin said lawmakers had no resolution that can legitimize the gathering at the sports club as a House session which is needed since it can express the collective sentiment of the lower chamber on a particular issue, person or event.
""Kung may resolution sila, siguro pwede ma-justify doon. E wala po ata silang resolution eh,"" Agabin told ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.
(If they have a resolution, they can justify the gathering there. But they apparently don't have a resolution.)
""Balewala po [yung gathering] kasi labag sa Saligang Batas eh. Pwedeng ma-challenge 'yun sa husgado.""
(The gathering is useless since it's against the Constitution. That can be challenged before the court.)
He said that if Velasco and his allies want to properly install him as the next Speaker, they should find the time when regular House sessions continue at the plenary in Batasan Pambansa. But until then, Cayetano is still the Speaker.
However, the Taguig lawmaker earlier suspended regular sessions ahead of schedule, which led some lawmakers' to lament that the crucial 2021 spending plan has been ""sacrificed"" over a feud with his rival for the chamber's leadership.
'Politics, saboteurs': Cayetano explains what forced him to suspend budget debates, House session
Despite this, Velasco has already taken his ""oath"" as Speaker, which Cayetano and his allies rejected and mocked, calling it ""katawa-tawa"" (ridiculous) and ""fake."" They branded Velasco camp's move as ""illegal,"" citing the location of the session and the absence of an ""official"" House mace.
The Marinduque lawmaker later disputed this and said there was precedence for House sessions being held outside of Batasan Pambansa.
""Noong nagkaroon tayo ng pagsabog ng Taal Volcano (When the Taal Volcano exploded), the whole House went to... Batangas to hold a House session. [I]t’s the same. Under the rules, it is allowed. This wasn’t a sham session,"" Velasco said.
'Katawa-tawa, fake': Cayetano, ally reject Velasco's election as Speaker
The move to oust Cayetano came after President Rodrigo Duterte's PDP-Laban and its regional party Hugpong ng Pagbabago, headed by Davao Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio, called on lawmakers to honor the term-sharing agreement between the two rivals.

According to Olivarez, they have ordered and given a downpayment for 200,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
In a previous interview, Olivarez said the AstraZeneca vaccines will arrive in the late in the second quarter of 2021.
""Meron na rin tayong negotiation sa Moderna, Pfizer, Novavax, and Johnson & Johnson,"" Olivarez said in a press conference Tuesday, where they unveiled their pro basketball teams.
""Lahat, i-inoculate natin. Walang maiiwan dito, at ipa-priority natin ang ating mga athletes,"" he guaranteed.
Parañaque is competing in the National Basketball League (NBL) and the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL), with the Lady Aces considered as one of the favorites for the inaugural pro season of the WNBL.
Olivarez said it was important for the city to be represented in these professional competitions.
""Malaking bagay ito. Nabibigyan natin ng importansiya ang ating youth, ang ating sports. At 'yung equality din ng men and women, dapat pantay-pantay ang pagtingin,"" he said.
""Umasa ang ating teams na we will support them,"" he added.
Olivarez further revealed that plans are underway for the construction of a 5,000-seater arena that will serve as the home of the Aces and the Lady Aces.
""May pondo na po tayo doon,"" he said. ""(Ito ay) para total na ma-support natin ang women's basketball league and men's league.""
Citizens of Parañaque City can pre-register for the COVID-19 vaccine through the city website. A QR code has been made available through Olivarez's official Facebook page as well.
As of March 2, there are 535 active cases of COVID-19 in Parañaque City. Of the 12,084 total cases, 11,390 have recovered. The city has recorded 159 deaths due to the novel coronavirus.

As for the PBA players, Marcial said they can get the vaccine either from their teams or from the league itself, should their help be needed by the franchises.
""Kunwari sa PBA, bigyan ko ng 25-30pax lang [per team],"" Marcial said during a recent appearance on ""The Chasedown.""""Depende. Kung gusto nila na teams, gusto nila na PBA, puwede.

""Baka available na sa kanila doon. Kung bibigyan sila, pinapayagan sila, bakit hindi?"" he said.
What matters for Marcial is that the players and the league follow the guidelines of the government when procuring the vaccine and getting vaccinated. At the moment, the Food and Drug Administration is evaluating Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, and may issue an emergency use authorization by January.

The bemedalled Filipina golfer secured a regular tour card in the United States LPGA, which meant she could’ve debuted in the top-tier competition this year.
But the worldwide spread of the dangerous novel coronavirus (COVID-19) forced virtually all sports events to a halt.
“COVID-19 is bigger than all of us. We really should put things into perspective,” said Pagdanganan, who is currently in the US.
“While we all have our own dreams and pursuits — I’m sure we’d all like to get out and do our own thing — right now, the most important thing really is to contain the spread of the virus.
“It’s not just about our own health. It’s about the health and welfare of the people around us.”
Like many athletes, the University of Arizona graduate said she continues to fitness-train online.
“It’s important to stay fit and be active so that when the season starts, I’ll be in tip-top shape,” Pagdanganan said.
Many countries have allowed golf activities to resume in varying degrees even without a vaccine available yet, because the sport is considered low risk for infection.
The first major of the 2020 golf season got underway on May 14 when South Korea hosted the Korea Ladies Professional Golf Association Championship.
The British Masters will resume on July 22, the first men’s major to relaunch this year.
Over the weekend, Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson joined NFL greats Peyton Manning and Tom Brady in a charity golf match in Florida on May 24.
LPGA looking at July restart
In the Philippines, several golf clubs in general quarantine conditions have opened their gates.
Pagdanganan, who won gold in individual stroke play in the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, said she is gradually hitting the fairways, too.
Still, she said she sticks to the rules in what could be the new normal in her sport.
“I only play when it’s extremely necessary; otherwise, I practice at home,” she said.
“And of course, when I do get to play outside, I still practice social distancing.”
With the LPGA hoping to get the 2020 season underway with the Dow Great Lakes Bay Invitational on July 15 to 18, Pagdanganan, a part of the gold-winning team in the 2019 SEA Games and 2018 Asian Games, said she wants to make sure she’s ready to make her debut.
“I’m a little more excited now since there’s a clearer schedule in terms of when the LPGA season can start,” she said.
“I have something to look forward to in the next few months. I just hope that things start to get better soon.”

""A handful of NBA teams are opening practice facilities, and it could well lead to the resumption of the NBA season. Major League Baseball is looking at reopening shop in July,"" said Marcial. ""Football in Europe is about to resume.""
""All these make me hopeful we can resume our Season 45,"" he said.

The league opened its 45th season on March 8, but suspended all activities just three days later because of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Since then, the Board of Governors and Marcial decided that they will either resume for one conference, or cancel the season outright.
Marcial agreed with the government's decision on Tuesday to extend the restrictions in many parts of the country. However, he also expressed his hopes that the government measures can flatten the curve soon, and subsequently allow the resumption of sports activities -- including the PBA.
""The board decision is to wait until August. Medyo matagal pa 'yon. Hopefully, by that time, medyo okay na, and allowed na ang gathering for a sports event, like the PBA,"" he said.
President Rodrigo Duterte on Tuesday approved the proposal to put Metro Manila, Laguna, and Cebu City under a modified enhanced community quarantine until May 31.
Under the modified lockdown, communities are still severely restricted, with most only allowed to leave their homes for provision of food and other basic necessities, and in case of emergency.
Wearing a facemask is a must, and physical distancing is still implemented.
""I'm expecting that, kasi marami pa ring cases of infection. I'm also endorsing wearing facemasks and social distancing,"" said Marcial. ""It's the new normal or new life for us, until there's a vaccine.""

MANILA, Philippines -- The Philippine Superliga (PSL) has partnered with the Go Negosyo program in order to acquire vaccines for its teams, league chairman Philip Ella Juico revealed.
During an appearance on ""Power and Play"" last Saturday, Juico said they have made an order for 1000 vaccines, through the Go Negosyo program of Joey Concepcion, the president of RFM Corp. and also the presidential adviser for entrepreneurship.
""Our request is being processed,"" said Juico. ""There are batches of vaccines and we are there in one of the batches.""
""Probably, if things go as planned, maybe we should have them by May or June,"" he added.
But the league already intends to open its 2021 season in February with a beach volleyball tournament, even if the players are not yet vaccinated. Juico says that while the vaccine is not yet available, the league will ""make do"" by holding the Beach Volleyball Challenge Cup in a bubble in Subic.The PSL met with local officials last week to discuss the details of the event, which was originally scheduled for November but postponed due to the typhoons that hit the country last year.
""Definitely, no spectators allowed,"" said Juico. ""The SBMA (Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority) has already prepared for a no-spectator type of arrangement and that has been the approval of the Board of Directors of the SBMA.""
The subsequent conferences, including the All-Filipino Cup, remain up in the air though Juico believes they will also take place in a bubble.
The PSL was forced to cancel its Grand Prix in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Juico says that ultimately, their plans -- including the vaccination of players -- will depend on government regulations and the COVID-19 situation in the country, particularly in the area where they plan to hold their tournaments.
""All these plans are dicey,"" he admitted. ""A lot depends on the environment, on how the numbers change in the locality, the infections and all of that, especially with this variant.""

Naredo, ABS-CBN News",Dec 15 2020 06:10 PM,"MANILA, Philippines -- After most professional sports competitions were held in a limited capacity in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the head of the Games and Amusements Board (GAB) expects pro sports to be back with a vengeance next year.
Because of the global health crisis, professional sporting events -- as did most sport competitions -- ground to a halt for most of the year. It was only in October that pro competitions began to return, primarily in bio-secure ""bubbles"" that did not allow for fans to be physically present.
Most prominent of these events was the PBA's bubble in Clark, Pampanga. The league held only one conference in a bid to salvage its 45th season, with Barangay Ginebra emerging as champions of the Philippine Cup.

""What happened in 2020 is very unfortunate for Philippine professional sports,"" acknowledged GAB chairman Baham Mitra during the Philippine Sportswriters Association (PSA) Forum on Tuesday morning.
""But we're looking at 2021 as a banner year. Merong gigil eh. Merong pagsasabik, so bulusok tayo sa 2021,"" he added.
Professional sporting events will start as early as January 2021, with chess to be played virtually. The PBA plans to open its new season in April, while professional volleyball will get underway with the Premier Volleyball League in the first or second quarter of 2021 as well.

Mitra further reported that there might be an international mixed martial event in the country by the second quarter of 2021, while a local promotion is planning a fight card in February.
""Baka sakali magkaroon tayo ng professional basketball league pa na mga bago, hindi pa natin ma-announce kung saan at kung kailan,"" he added. ""We're looking at beach volleyball to turn pro. We're also looking at pingpong turning pro.""
Women's sports will be at the forefront, especially with the Women's National Basketball League (WNBL) set to hold its first pro season next year as well.
""Marami tayong magagaling na basketball players na maha-highlight dahil magpo-professional na rin po ang babaeng basketball,"" said Mitra.
As excited as he is for pro sports to get back into the swing of things, Mitra also warned that Filipino athletes, coaches, and officials must continue to stay vigilant. This, even with the welcome news that a COVID-19 vaccine is already being distributed and administered in other countries.
Mitra said GAB will continue to remind its stakeholders to stay safe and follow the health and safety protocols imposed by the government.
""We must continue to stay safe. And we at GAB will make sure that we remind them,"" said Mitra.

MANILA - Even if a coronavirus vaccine has been successfully developed but people don't observe proper health safety protocols, the work put in its development would be in vain, a medical expert said Tuesday.
Dr. Nina Gloriani, head of vaccine development panel of the Department of Science and Technology, said people still have to observe health safety rules, like mandatory physical distancing and wear face masks, since a vaccine for the coronavirus doesn't mean full protection for all.
""Hindi lang naman ang vaccine ang solution eh... Kasi pwede magpabakuna pero sige, lakad sa party ganon. Hindi lahat ng nababakunahan ay mapoprotektahan,"" Gloriani said in an interview with ABS-CBN's TeleRadyo.
Gloriani explained they are only expecting a 50 to 60 percent efficacy or protection rate from a coronavirus vaccine since it was developed amid the ongoing pandemic.
""This is a pandemic vaccine, na hindi pa natin masyado maintindihan ang efficacy na rate. Ang [expectation] ng WHO (World Health Organization) ay 50 hanggang 60 percent lang,"" she said.
Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier announced that his country has developed the first vaccine offering ""sustainable immunity"" against the disease.
""One of my daughters had this vaccine. I think in this sense she took part in the experiment,"" Putin said.
The Russian government, however, approved the possible vaccine before clinical trials were completed and without disclosing its side effects.
Russia said it hopes to launch the possible vaccine's mass production within weeks and turn out ""several million"" doses per month by next year.

Diego Vara, Reuters/FileBEIJING - As wealthy countries scramble to buy up the limited supply of big-name coronavirus vaccines, China is stepping in to offer its homegrown jabs to poorer countries. But the largesse is not entirely altruistic, with Beijing hoping for a long-term diplomatic return.
The strategy carries multiple possible benefits: deflecting anger and criticism over China's early handling of the pandemic, raising the profile of its biotech firms, and both strengthening and extending influence in Asia and beyond.
""There is no doubt China is practicing vaccine diplomacy in an effort to repair its tarnished image,"" Huang Yanzhong, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), told AFP.
""It has also become a tool to increase China's global influence and iron out... geopolitical issues.""
Indonesia receives over a million Chinese COVID-19 vaccine doses
Stung by criticism of its handling of the emergence of the coronavirus in Wuhan, China has made much of its own ability to get its own outbreak under control, with state media carrying pictures of life-as-normal at pool parties and sporting events.
In the early months of the pandemic, Beijing hurried to export millions of masks and gowns, and sent medical teams to help strained healthcare systems in Europe and Africa.Now, with major Western pharmaceutical companies beginning to bring their vaccines to market, China is rolling out its own versions -- signing agreements to supply millions of doses, including to countries that have a sometimes-prickly relationship with Beijing.
SEIZING THE MANTLE
Chinese diplomats have inked deals with Malaysia and the Philippines, both of which have previously complained about Beijing's expansionist ambitions in the South China Sea.

In August, Premier Li Keqiang promised priority vaccine access to countries along the Mekong river, where a devastating drought has been worsened by Chinese dams built upstream.
""China's 'vaccine diplomacy' is not unconditional,"" Ardhitya Eduard Yeremia and Klaus Heinrich Raditio said in a paper published this month by the Singapore-based Yusof Ishak institute.""Beijing may use its vaccine donations to advance its regional agenda, particularly on sensitive issues such as its claims in the South China Sea,"" they added.
The move by President Xi Jinping to offer up a Chinese vaccine worldwide as a ""public good"" also allows Beijing to paint itself as a leader in global health, said the CFR's Huang, seizing a mantle left untended as the US retreated under Donald Trump's ""America First"" doctrine.
Washington is notably absent from a global alliance of 189 countries that have pledged to distribute vaccines equitably. Beijing signed up in October as its drugmakers launched final stage trials.
But this program has only secured enough doses to cover 20 percent of the population of low- and middle-income countries by the end of next year -- offering a commercial opportunity.
China is ramping up production facilities to make one billion coronavirus shots next year -- and, having largely tamed the outbreak at home, it will have a surplus to sell.

'HEALTH SILK ROAD'
If China can capture just 15 percent of the market in middle and low-income countries, it would net around $2.8 billion in sales, according to an estimate by Essence Securities, a Hong Kong-based brokerage firm.
""Everyone is clamoring for a vaccine and Beijing is in a good position to tap gold at the bottom of the pyramid,"" said an analyst at the company, who declined to be named.
The global inoculation drive also requires storage facilities and cold chains to transport the doses.
Such projects dovetail nicely with Xi's $1 trillion infrastructure push -- the Belt and Road Initiative -- which has otherwise taken a hit because of the pandemic, said Kirk Lancaster of the CFR.
E-commerce giant Alibaba has already built warehouses in Ethiopia and Dubai that will serve as vaccine distribution hubs for Africa and the Middle East.
Beijing is constructing vaccine production facilities in countries like Brazil, Morocco and Indonesia that have participated in global trials by Chinese drugmakers.
And China has promised a $1 billion loan to Latin American and Caribbean nations to fund procurement.
Chinese firms will be able to piggyback on this infrastructure further down the line.
""All these efforts, branded as the 'Health Silk Road', are helping China redeem its national reputation while opening up new markets for its companies,"" Lancaster said.

TRUST GAP
However, there is a fly in the ointment.
China has four vaccines in the final stages of development, and is well advanced with mass human testing in a number of countries, including Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey.
Millions more at home have already received a jab.
Brazil's Sao Paulo gets 1 million doses of China candidate vaccine
But unlike vaccines being developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson, little information has been published about the safety or efficacy of Chinese vaccines.
The country's communist authorities -- who control everything from universities to regulators -- are allergic to public scrutiny.
""The lack of transparency in China's system means that thousands (inside the country) have already received Chinese vaccines without the relevant testing data having being published,"" Natasha Kassam, a China policy analyst at the Lowy Institute, said.She said that the lack of data ""will cause alarm"" during a global rollout.Chinese vaccine makers also have chequered reputations, after major scandals at home involving expired or poor quality products.All of which means overseas buyers are cautious.
Chinese vaccine frontrunners Sinovac and Sinopharm had pre-orders for fewer than 500 million doses by mid-November, according to data from London consultancy Airfinity -- mostly from countries that have participated in trials.
Sinovac secures $515-M funding to boost COVID-19 vaccine production
AstraZeneca, meanwhile, has pre-orders for 2.4 billion doses, and Pfizer has about half a billion orders.
Wider trust in Beijing has also plummeted this year, with a 14-nation study by the Pew Research Center finding a sharp deterioration in perceptions of the country.
""(Societies) that have increasing distrust in China are less likely to trust a Chinese-led vaccine candidate,"" Kassam said.

MANILA - Sixty-six percent of adult Filipinos are willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if a vaccine is currently available, a Social Weather Stations (SWS) phone survey revealed.The survey, conducted September 17-20, 2020, showed that 32 percent of Filipinos said they will ""definitely"" get the vaccine while 34 percent said they would ""probably"" get the vaccine, for a total of 66 percent.
Thirty-one percent of those surveyed said they are unwilling to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Of this percentage, 14 percent said they ""probably"" won't get the vaccine, while 17 percent said they ""definitely"" would not get the vaccine.
The survey also found that Filipinos are more willing to get the vaccine against COVID-19, compared to a similar survey in 2019 involving the Dengvaxia vaccine.
According to SWS, a 2019 survey asked Filipinos whether the sale of the Dengvaxia vaccine should be allowed in the Philippines, of which 62 percent said it should be disallowed in the country.
Only 42 percent of respondents were willing to get the Dengvaxia vaccine at that time.
The survey, likewise, showed that more people from Mindanao are willing to get the vaccine at 73 percent, compared to 69 percent in the Visayas, 64 percent in Metro Manila and 61 percent in Balance Luzon.
The willingness to get the vaccine is also higher among men and those from the younger groups.
Seventy-one percent of men are willing to get the vaccine, compared to 60 percent of women.
The willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is also higher among those aged 25 to 30 years old compared to other age groups.
A total of 1,249 adult Filipinos 18 years old and above participated in the National Mobile Phone Survey, which was conducted using a mobile phone and computer-assisted telephone interviewing.SWS said Filipino's willingness to get the vaccine is between that of New Zealand (74 percent) and the United States (59 percent).
The data from New Zealand is based on a survey conducted by the Massey University from June 26 to July 13, 2020, while the data from the United States is based on surveys by the Pew Research Center and Gallup.
The survey has a sampling error margin of ±3% for national percentages, ±6% for Metro Manila, ±5% for Balance Luzon, ±6% for the Visayas, and ±6% for Mindanao.
Respondents were asked the question: ""Kung mayroong bakunang makakapigil sa Covid-19 sa ngayon, kayo ba ay… (Talagang magpapabakuna, Malamang magpapabakuna, Malamang na hindi magpapabakuna, Talagang hindi magpapabakuna)? [If a vaccine to prevent Covid-19 were available today, would you… (Definitely get the vaccine, Probably get the vaccine, Probably not get the vaccine, Definitely not get the vaccine)]”.It is patterned after the Pew Research Center surveys in the US, conducted from April 29 to May 5, 2020 and September 8-13, 2020.
An earlier SWS survey also showed that 80 percent of Filipinos are expecting the COVID-19 vaccine to be available soon.

The Department of Health (DOH), however, said that two of the COVID-19 vaccine frontrunners are not interested in conducting clinical trials in the Philippines but are open to distribution here.
“Pfizer and Moderna, they do not intend to have clinical trials here in the country,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a virtual briefing.

MANILA - A public health expert on Tuesday said President Rodrigo Duterte should be ""given a script"" regarding vaccine development during his public briefings in order to avoid confusion amid growing expectations of a COVID-19 vaccine within the year.
Dr. Lulu Bravo, executive director of Philippine Foundation for Vaccination, urged Filipinos to listen to experts about the process of making a vaccine, saying it is a complex undertaking that may take years to ensure its safety and efficacy.
""Nagkaroon ng meeting sa DOH (Department of Health), 'yun din ang sinabi ko, sana nga bigyan na lang natin ng script ang Pangulo tungkol sa mga ganitong vaccine development. Hindi madaling intindihin 'yung vaccine development,"" she told Teleradyo's ""SRO"".
Duterte prefers COVID-19 vaccines from China, Russia
Bravo's appeal came a day after Duterte said his administration would prioritize potential COVID-19 vaccines made by drugmakers from China and Russia.
She said that a non-expert's explanation on such topic may only sow confusion.
""Kasi nga mahirap i-explain. Sabi nga ng iba, 'pag pinag-uusapan na 'yang tungkol sa mga mikrobyo, sa germs, paano gagawa ng bakuna, ay talagang duduguin ka. Kasi mahirap isipin kung paano gagawain 'yan,"" she said.
Bravo, who has been doing vaccine trials in the country for decades, also offered her group's expertise to the President.
""Kaya 'pag minsan 'pag medyo nagkamali ka ng nasabi mo, nako-confuse ang tao. Sabi nga natin, mas mabuti ang nage-explain sa atin ay 'yun talagang eksperto at gumagawa ng vaccine trial kasi kung hindi ka eksperto at hindi gumagawa ng vaccine trial, minsan medyo namamali 'yung nasasabi mo,"" she said.

Laboratories around the world are racing to find a vaccine to rein in COVID-19, which has infected almost 30 million people and killed more than 929,000, according to a running tally from Johns Hopkins University.
The World Health Organization said in early September that 34 vaccine candidates worldwide are currently in the various phases of being tested on humans, while a further 142 are in pre-clinical evaluation.
To date, the Philippines has recorded 269,407 coronavirus infections, with 57,392 active cases. The tally also includes 4,663 people who succumbed to the disease while 207,352 were declared to have recovered.

Ako 'yung maunang ma-eksperimentuhan. Okay para sa akin,” Duterte said, after thanking Russian President Vladimir Putin for offering vaccines to the Philippines.
(Once the vaccine arrives, in public, I will ask to be injected. They can experiment on me first. That’s okay with me.)

But at 75, and the fact that he is the President of the Philippines, can he really take this risk?
Apparently, yes, but he might not be the first in line, according to Dr. Nina Gloriani, University of the Philippines College of Public Health professor and head of the Department of Science and Technology’s vaccine technical panel.
“Sa clinical trials, meron tayong priority groups to immunize. Sa una. Kasi, hindi natin kilala itong vaccine. Yung mauuna, 18 years old to 59,” Gloriani said, referring to vaccines in general.
(In clinical trials, we have priority groups for immunization. That's at the start, because we don’t know this vaccine. The first ones to get it are those 18 years old to 59.)
“'Pag medyo ayos na yung resulta doon at successful, safe and can protect, so, pwede na tayo magbakuna sa special groups na tinatawag,” she added.
(Once the result shows that it is successful, safe and can protect, we can now immunize special groups.)
Special groups include senior citizens, children, people with pre-existing conditions, and those with compromised immune systems.
Gloriani said all those who will volunteer for vaccine clinical trials will be subjected to the inclusion and exclusion checklist to see if they qualify.
“'Pag lumabas sya sa exclusion, hindi sya pe-pwede. Pero kung papasa sya, kasi may checklist yun, why not?” she said of Duterte.“I think pwede naman pero dadaan sa proseso.”
(If he is listed under those who will be excluded, then he can’t. But if he passes - because we have a checklist - why not? I think it’s possible, but it will have to go through a process.)
While Russia claims it now has the first COVID-19 vaccine in the world, some have questioned the process it underwent since it was approved in less than two months.

News reports said the vaccine from Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute was approved by its health ministry before Phase III human trials, which involves large-scale testing for the efficacy of the vaccine.
Other vaccine frontrunners such as the United States' Moderna vaccine and the United Kingdom’s Oxford vaccine have yet to get government approval while undergoing Phase III trials.
Gloriani assured the public that the Philippine vaccine panel will carefully study all vaccines that will apply for clinical trials in the Philippines.
She explained that clinical trials in the country would help check if a vaccine is effective for Filipinos since there are “ethnicity or genetic differences in immune responses.”
There are also other side effects and immune responses that are not just based on genetics, but also nutrition and other factors, she said.",abscbn

MAYNILA - Naghahanda na ang bansa sa pagdating at pag-rollout ng bakuna kontra COVID-19 sa kalagitnaan ng buwan. Pero marami pa ring Pilipino ang may alinlangan hinggil sa bakuna at posibleng maging epekto nito sa kanila.

ANO ANG DAPAT ASAHAN MATAPOS MAGPABAKUNA?
Ayon kay Lobo, may mga taong walang nararamdamang reaksiyon matapos mabakunahan. Mayroon namang iba na nagkakaroon ng reaksiyon, pero ito ay normal lang, aniya.
“Meron pong iba, nakakaramdam ng pananakit o pamamaga sa injection site o pamumula. Normal reaction po yun. Ibig sabihin, yung bakuna, maganda ang uptake sa katawan natin, na-recognize ng ating immune system. Meron pong iba, nilalagnat o inaantok. Pero, kadalasan, maa-address po 'yun sa pagbigay ng paracetamol sa lagnat at pananakit. Tapos, after 2 or 3 days, mawawala po siyang mag-isa,” sabi ni Lobo.
Pwede ring lagyan ng ice compress ang injection site para mabawasan ang pananakit at pamamaga.
PUWEDE BANG UMINOM NG GAMOT BILANG PAGHAHANDA BAGO MABAKUNAHAN?
Ayon kay Lobo, hindi inirerekomenda ang pre-medication o ang pag-inom ng gamot, tulad ng anti-allergy, bago magpabakuna.
“Kadalasan po kasi, baka mangyari, ma-delay yung reaction. Inoobserbahan sila for 30 minutes, baka po walang makita; tapos pagdating sa bahay, meron. Kaya po, mas maganda, wala po silang ininom na gamot para po kita yung reaction, kung meron,” saad niya.
Magkakaroon rin naman ng screening sa mga taong babakunahan kung saan kukunin ang kanilang vital signs at magsasagawa rin ng counseling.
“Tatanungin kayo kung meron kayong reaction previously, mga gamot na iniinom para malaman din kung merong posibilidad na magkaroon ng cross reaction sa mga sinasabing gamot o sa bakuna,” sabi niya.

Matapos mabakunahan, hinikayat ni Lobo ang mga pasyente na huwag magmadaling umuwi.
“Kadalasan po, 30 minutes will be sufficient kasi po yung mga nagkakaroon ng allergic reaction, yung severe allergic reaction na sinasabi natin na anaphylaxis doon po sa isang Brighton Collaboration study, nakita po nila na almost 70 percent ng magkakaroon ng severe allergic reaction, nakikita po within 15 minutes. Tapos umaabot po ng 80 to 85 percent pagkabago po mag-30 minutes. Kaya mas safe po yung 30 minutes na observation period,” paliwanag niya.
PAANO MASASABI NA ANG ADVERSE EVENT AY SA BAKUNA O SA IBANG FACTOR GALING?
Sabi ni Lobo, kadalasang nagkakaroon sila ng investigation for causality.
“Tinitingnan natin po yung relasyon, yung paglabas ng sinasabing kino-complain nila at saka mga oras kung kailan lumabas yun, at saka kung expected po na reaction sa mga bakunang ibinibigay,” ani Lobo.
Kailangan maibestigahan muna umano ito bago mag-deklara na mayroong causality, na may kinalaman ang kanilang naranasang reaksiyon sa bakuna.
“Yun po ay pinagmimitingan din ng mga imbestigador para po magkaroon ng 100 porsiyento na may basehan sa siyensa, na doon nga galing sa bakuna yun o hindi,” dagdag niya.
Sakaling makaranas ng adverse reaction, tulad ng hirap sa paghinga, at naimbestigahan na ito ay galing sa bakuna, ang pasyente ay hindi na maaaring mabigyan ng ikalawang dose ng bakuna.
Mayroon ring protocol na susundin para sa mga pasyenteng magkakaroon ng severe allergic reaction.
“Meron pong mga gamot na ini-inject sa inyo para hindi na mag-progress (ang) reaction n'yo; at the same time, mahinto po siya,” sabi niya.
Ipinaalala niya na ang ibinibigay ng pamahalaan ng emergency use authorization sa mga bakuna ay hindi lisensiya para sa pagbenta sa mga vaccine. Ito ay pagtitiyak lang din na ang bakunang ibibigay sa mga Pilipino ay ligtas, epektibo at libre.

OBSERBAHAN MUNA MGA NABAKUNAHAN
Ginagawa aniya nila ang information campaign para iparating sa publiko na ligtas ang bakuna at maialis ang kanilang agam-agam kaugnay dito.
Kahit pa mahigpit na sinusunod ang pagsuot ng face mask, face shield, paghuhugas ng kamay at physical distancing, ang mga minimum health protocols na ito ay nagpapabagal lamang sa pagkalat ng COVID-19, pero hindi tuluyang nakapipigil sa virus.
“Pagka sinama ang bakuna doon, at maraming tao ang nabakunahan, doon lang po makakabangon ang ating ekonomiya at saka makakatulong po sa atin bawat isa,” sabi niya.
Para mapawi ang agam-agam ng marami tungkol sa pagpapabakuna, lalo na ang may mga iniindang sakit o may mga allergy, mas mainam na kumonsulta muna sa kanilang mga doktor o mga espesyalista tulad ng allergists.
Iniimbitahan ni Lobo ang publiko na tumutok sa kanilang Facebook Live kung saan tatalakayin ang allergies at COVID-19 vaccines ngayong Huwebes, Pebrero 11, alas-9 ng umaga.
“Mag-o-open to questions po 'yan at sasagutin namin mga katanungan nila,” sabi niya.

On World Immunization Week, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire reminded Filipino parents that immunization or vaccination is still the most successful and most cost-effective health intervention.
She said that around 20 million children around the world are currently not getting immunized.
To address this problem, the DOH issued Department Memorandum No. 2020-0150 or the Interim Guidelines for Immunization Services in the Context of COVID-19 Outbreak.
The guidelines include routine immunization for newborn babies up to 1-year-old infants and selective catch-up vaccination of “defaulters” below 5 years old.
Vergeire explained that the decision to push through with routine immunization depends on risk assessment and the requirement that infection and prevention control equipment are being used during vaccinations.
“Kinakailangang maglista ng healthcare workers ng mga batang hindi nabakunahan at agad na magsagawa ng active catch-up immunization once COVID-19 situation permits,” Vergeire said during a televised briefing.
(Health care workers should list down children who were not vaccinated and push through with catch-up immunization once COVID-19 situation permits.)
Private clinics are also encouraged to continue vaccination efforts as long as physical distancing is observed.
Health Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje of the Public Health Services Team said immunization is important to prevent the spread of polio, measles, tetanus, and diptheria.
Cabotaje pointed out that vaccinations at public health centers are free.
She said some health centers might be closed as health workers focus on COVID-19 response but house-to-house immunization can still be organized.
“Kung may sintomas yung nanay, dapat hindi sya pumupunta sa mga health center,” she Cabotaje said.
(If the mother is feeling ill, she should not go to the health center anymore.)
She said both the parents and the health worker should wear a face mask although there is no need for an infant to wear one.",abscbn

MANILA - Pia Wurtzbach swears by her Miss Universe crown that a local chocolate brand is better than the foreign competition, so much so that she sent a box to Hollywood blogger Perez Hilton.
And when Pacific Rim leaders converge in the Philippines this week to discuss free trade and nuclear tensions in the Korean peninsula, their spouses will get dark chocolates from Davao City, President Rodrigo Duterte's hometown.
Filipino chocolatiers are pushing back against imported candies that are being offered at cheaper prices while building niche markets abroad.
""Kapag tinanggal mo yang mga brand na yan, hindi mo talaga mapapansin yung difference kasi masarap talaga siya,"" Wurtzbach told ABS-CBN News.
(If you strip the brand names, you won't notice the difference because it's really delicious.)
Hilton asked for samples of the chocolate brand she was endorsing when she posted a photo on Instagram, Wurtzbach said. The gossip writer was among judges who voted unanimously for the Filipina beauty queen during the 2015 Miss Universe Pageant.
Foreign brands such as Cadbury and Meiji have been offering smaller servings at around P20 per bar to compete on price with local brands such as Goya, endorsed by Wurtzbach.
Still, Filipinos prefer local brands due to their ""level of sweetness that suits local taste preferences,"" research firm Euromonitor International said in a study.
Chocolates and chocolate-covered bars such as Nips and Cloud 9 from tycoon John Gokongwei's Universal Robina, accounted for 61 percent of the market last year, according to Euromonitor.
Davao-based Malagos Chocolates has built a steady following abroad with its dark chocolate bars and tablets that dissolve into drinks. Spouses of ASEAN leaders will get to try both this week, courtesy of Honeylet Avancena, the President's partner.

Philippine cacao gives Malagos Chocolates its unique flavor, said lead chocolatier Rex Puentespina told ABS-CBN News.

""It has to be local because we really have to promote sustainability para magtulong-tulungan tayo (We need to help each other),"" he said.
Malagos is experimenting with chocolate-covered dried fruits and more Instagram-friendly packaging to attract more clients, especially in hotels, Puentespina said.
The company's foreign clients include a Singaporean ice cream shop that uses Malagos in its concoctions, he said.
""Tourism arrivals there is very high and it's close to us, but it's a tough market also because all the major brands are there and they are price-sensitive, he said.
For Wurtzbach, international recognition for Philippine chocolates is overdue.
""I think it's about time na ma-recognize worldwide ang isang Filipino brand na kaya din naman to be at par with international brands,"" she said.
(I think it's about time that a Filipino brand is recognized worldwide, that it can be at par with international brands.)",abscbn
