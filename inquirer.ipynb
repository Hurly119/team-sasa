      "According to Galvez, the global vaccination figure has reached 300 million, with seven million people being vaccinated per day.“We are happy that the Philippines is part of those numbers and that we have already administered more or less 44,000 doses,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino.\n",
      "Galvez said many people were requesting “almost every day” allocations of the vaccines, an indication of their willingness to get immunized against the deadly respiratory disease.\n",
      "“When we had the vaccination of hospital directors, their level of confidence increased,“ he said.\n",
      "The Philippines kicked off its COVID-19 vaccination program last Monday, after the arrival of 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the vaccine produced by China’s Sinovac BioTech.\n",
      "The first to get vaccinated was the director of the Philippine General Hospital, Dr. Gerardo “Gap” Legaspi.\n",
      "Also last week, over 400,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered.\n",
      "Earlier, Malacañang said more than 29,000 individuals had been vaccinated against COVID-19.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — As the country pursues avenues to secure COVID-19 vaccines, prices of available and soon-to-be-available COVID-19 vaccines started to evoke curiosity.\n",
      "The senators, for one, have begun analyzing the price tags of the seven vaccine brands that the Philippines might obtain for its planned inoculation program.Data released by Senate committee on finance chair Sonny Angara detailed the prices of the different vaccines for two doses per person. The total price of each vaccine is inclusive of the value-added tax (VAT) and the cost of inflation.\n",
      "It also stated how many Filipinos could be inoculated based on the vaccine’s price and the P82.5 billion budget allotted by the Philippine government for acquiring COVID-19 vaccines next year.\n",
      "Data from Senator Sonny Angara’s Office\n",
      "Moderna\n",
      "According to Angara’s data, Moderna’s vaccine will cost around P3,904 to P4,504 for two doses per person. This is the most expensive among the list of vaccines based on the senator’s information.\n",
      "Approximately 18,317,051 to 21,132,172 Filipinos may receive this vaccine under the earmarked P82.5 billion budget for COVID-19 vaccines, Angara said.\n",
      "About Moderna: Moderna is a Massachusetts-based biotechnology company that focuses on drug discovery and development. It also makes vaccines based on mRNA (messenger RNA).\n",
      "How their vaccine works: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website said the vaccine, also known as “mRNA-1273,” basically uses mRNA, a genetic molecule that carries the instructions for making proteins in our body. This vaccine requires two shots that will be given 28 days apart.\n",
      "The mRNA in the vaccine will instruct cells to make a harmless spike protein – which can also be seen on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, the new variant of coronavirus that causes respiratory disease COVID-19, said the CDC website.\n",
      "According to the CDC, the protruding spikes and spike fragments in the cell will then be recognized by the immune system and cause an immune response that produces antibodies.\n",
      "These antibodies stop the coronavirus from attacking other cells by attaching to the virus’s spikes. The antibodies can also mark the virus so other cells can detect and destroy it.Moderna’s vaccine needs to be stored at -20C.\n",
      "Status development: Moderna announced last month that it has finished the first interim analysis of the Phase 3 study for mRNA-1273. According to the company, the study showed that its vaccine has an efficacy rate of 94.5 percent.\n",
      "Issues and concerns: Based on a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Moderna’s vaccine can protect for at least three months.\n",
      "But according to a report by the New York Times, since the vaccine is new, researchers still have no idea how long the vaccine’s protection will last.\n",
      "The report added that the number of antibodies and T-cells might reduce months after the vaccination. However, memory B-cells and memory-T cells might retain the information about the coronavirus even after years or decades.\n",
      "Roll-out: Moderna applied for emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) on November 30. USFDA is set to decide on its application on December 17. If approved, Moderna can start releasing its vaccines in the US before the end of the month.\n",
      "Sinovac\n",
      "The second-most-expensive vaccine on the data is Sinovac with a price tag of P 3,629.50 for two doses per person. Some 22,730,403 Filipinos may benefit from the vaccine if acquired by the government, according to Angara’s information.\n",
      "About Sinovac: Sinovac is a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company founded in 2001. Their focus is on the research, development, and manufacture of vaccines against infectious diseases such as H1N1 influenza and COVID-19.\n",
      "How their vaccine works: Unlike Moderna, which uses RNA in its vaccines, Sinovac’s CoronaVac relies on inactivated pathogens that are grown and killed in laboratories.\n",
      "Similar to the inactivated vaccines used for polio, this vaccine uses the killed viruses to produce antigens which signal the immune system to attack the virus causing COVID-19.\n",
      "CoronaVac can be stored in a standard refrigerator at 2-8 degrees Celsius.\n",

      "COVID-19 policy chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. earlier said that the vaccine may be the first to be rolled out in the country, probably by the first quarter of 2021.\n",
      "Sinovac has yet to report the efficacy rate of CoronaVac.\n",
      "Issues and concerns:Sinovac has been recently reported to be involved in a bribery scandal. However, the company cleared out its CEO, Yin Weidong, of the accusations.\n",
      "Roll-out:According to Galvez, they are already finalizing negotiations with Sinovac. He said the pharmaceutical firm vowed to supply vaccines in the country by April 2021. However, Galvez negotiated to get it by March.\n",
      "Pfizer-BioNTech\n",
      "Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech’s vaccine costs P2,379 for two doses per person. Data showed that roughly 34,678,436 Filipinos may get the shots based on the government’s allocated fund for vaccine procurement next year.\n",
      "About Pfizer and BioNTech: US-based multinational pharmaceutical corporation, Pfizer, is also known as one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies.\n",

      "Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccine requires storage with a temperature of -70 degrees Celsius.\n",
      "Status development:Pfizer and BioNTech concluded the Phase 3 study for their vaccine on November 18. Meanwhile, the USFDA on December 12 granted an emergency use authorization for the vaccine, and on December 14 started its use in New York City.\n",
      "The United Kingdom, the first country in the world to conduct mass inoculation against COVID-19 starting December 8, likewise used the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.\n",
      "On Monday, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Long announced the approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for his country’s mass vaccination program that will likely begin by end-December. Later, Jordan announced it had approved emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine.\n",
      "Pfizer’s vaccine showed a 95 percent efficacy rate during its study.\n",
      "Issues and concerns: U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on December 10 issued an anaphylaxis warning on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after reports of three cases of adverse reactions.\n",
      "According to MHRA, there were two reports of anaphylaxis and one possible allergic reaction after administering the vaccines.\n",
      "“Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,” MHRA Chief Executive June Raine said in a statement.\n",
      "“Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against COVID-19 outweigh the risks… You can be completely confident that this vaccine has met the MHRA’s robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness,” Raine assured.\n",
      "Roll-out: Pfizer-BioNTech began its first shipment of the vaccines to several states in America on December 13.\n",
      "Gamaleya\n",
      "Named after the first Soviet space satellite, Gamaleya Research Institutes’s Sputnik V vaccine is worth P 1,220 for two doses per person. According to the data provided by Angara, with its price, the vaccine may be administered to 67,622,950 Filipinos using the P82.5 billion budget.\n",
      "About Gamaleya: The Gamelaya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology is a Russian medical-research institute founded in 1891.\n",
      "According to Gamelaya, it “runs one of the unique “virus libraries” in the world and has its own vaccine production facility.”\n",
      "Aside from their research for the COVID-19 vaccine, they are also working to develop a vaccine against Ebola and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).\n",
      "How their vaccine works: Sputnik V is a two-part adenovirus-based vector vaccine. It uses a vector (an engineered virus that lacks the gene to reproduce) to send a message in cells to produce spike proteins.\n",
      "“The gene from adenovirus, which causes the infection, is removed while a gene with the code of a protein from another virus spike is inserted,” the institute explained.\n",
      "“This inserted element is safe for the body but still helps the immune system to react and produce antibodies, which protect us from the infection,” it added.\n",
      "Photo courtesy of Gamaleya Center RDF\n",
      "Sputnik V is stored in a regular refrigerator temperature (in dry form).\n",
      "Status development: Gamaleya on November 24 announced that it has finished the second interim analysis of clinical trial data for Sputnik V.\n",
      "READ: Russia vaccine ‘passes early trial test’\n",
      "“The Sputnik V vaccine’s efficacy is confirmed at 91.4% based on data analysis of the final control point of clinical trials. The Sputnik V vaccine efficacy against severe cases of coronavirus is 100%,” Gamaleya reported.\n",
      "In October, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) submitted applications to the World Health Organization for an Emergency Use Listing and prequalification of Sputnik V.\n",
      "According to a report on Monday, Russia is almost done completing its clinical trials for its COVID-19 vaccine for domestic animals and mink.\n",
      "Issues and concerns: Some scientists have recently expressed concerns towards Sputnik V due to a “lack of safety data.” However, Russia denounced the criticisms.\n",
      "Roll-out: Galvez recently said that the Russian vaccine may possibly be available in the Philippines as early as the first quarter of 2021.\n",
      "COVAX Facility\n",
      "COVAX Facility, compared to the first four companies on the list, offers a lower price for COVID-19 vaccines. Data showed that it will only cost around P854 for two doses per person. It can vaccinate at least 96,604,215 Filipinos, based on the information of Senator Angara.\n",
      "About COVAX Facility: COVAX Facility, also known as the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Acces Facility, is a global mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide.\n",
      "It is co-led by Gavi, an international organization created to improve access to new and underused vaccines, along with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization.\n",
      "The Philippines joined COVAX Facility in July.\n",
      "How does COVAX Facility work? “The COVAX Facility will make investments across a broad portfolio of promising vaccine candidates (including those being supported by CEPI) to make sure at-risk investment in manufacturing happens now,” Gavi explained.\n",
      "Since it follows a pooling process, COVAX can ensure rapid access to vaccines.\n",
      "Status about COVID-19 vaccine: According to the Philippines’ vaccine czar Galvez, about 80 percent of the vaccines in the global market were already taken by rich countries. The COVAX Facility, on the other hand, was able to acquire 2 percent.\n",
      "This means that the country is “fighting” to secure the other 18 percent of the vaccine supply.\n",
      "AstraZeneca\n",
      "AstraZeneca’s vaccine is worth only P610 for two doses per person. This appeared to be ideal for the country’s budget. Given its price and the P82.5 billion allocation of the government for vaccine procurement next year, it can inoculate 135,245,901 Filipinos, Angara’s graph indicated.\n",
      "About AstraZeneca: AstraZeneca is a British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company that focuses on the development and commercialization of prescription medicine.\n",
      "Their medicines are targeted for the treatment of cardiovascular, metabolic, respiratory, inflammation, autoimmune, oncology, infection, and neuroscience diseases.\n",
      "AstraZeneca collaborated with the University of Oxford to create a COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "How their vaccine works:Like Russia’s Sputnik V, AstraZeneca’s vaccines use a genetically altered virus called adenovirus. This virus, which is not harmful to recipients, will carry spike protein (like the “crowns” in coronavirus). Injecting this, in theory, will help the immune system to recognize and attack coronavirus.\n",
      "AstraZeneca’s vaccine requires a regular fridge temperature for storage.\n",
      "Status development: AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford announced on December 8 that it finished the Phase 3 interim analysis for the vaccine.\n",
      "The researchers noted that the efficacy rate for two doses – with the first dose at half strength – reached 90 percent. While a combination of two full-strength doses only resulted in 62 percent efficacy.\n",
      "READ: AstraZeneca says COVID-19 ‘vaccine for the world’ can be 90% effective\n",
      "Issues and concerns: Scientists questioned the vaccine efficacy rate after the reported error in dosage. In a report published by the New York Times on November 25, experts inquired how the combination of half dosage for the first shot and full dosage for the second shot resulted in a 90 percent efficacy rate.\n",
      "Roll-out:According to the Department of Health (DOH), the government is negotiating with the firm, after AstraZeneca pulled out its application to conduct clinical trials in the country noting it already has enough data for the vaccine tests.\n",
      "READ: Getting AstraZeneca vaccine still ‘doable’ even with company pullout from trial\n",
      "“We are already having negotiations with AstraZeneca. So their next step would be the application for an emergency use authorization here in the country if ever and also with the other countries. So ito pong FDA (Food and Drug Administration) process na natin ang kanilang pag-a-applyan (This is the FDA process they have to undergo),” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Monday.\n",
      "Novavax\n",
      "Among the seven vaccines in the data presented by Angara, Novovax was the most affordable. Two doses of Novavax vaccine costs only P366 per person, thus, some 225,409,836 Filipinos can receive and benefit from it amid the P82.5 billion budget.\n",
      "About Novavax: Novavax, a late-stage US biotechnology company, focuses on the discovery, development, and commercialization of vaccines to prevent serious infectious diseases.\n",
      "This Maryland company is smaller compared to other vaccine manufacturers. They received a $1.6 billion grant from the US government’s Operation Warp Speed to produce 100 million doses by 2021.\n",
      "How their vaccines work: According to an article published in the Science Magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Novavax first inserts baculovirus into moth cells.\n",
      "The baculovirus, a pathogen that attacks insects, will make moth cells produce a protein called spike – which is present in coronavirus.\n",
      "The spikes are then harvested by scientists and mixed with a “synthetic soap like particle” where the spikes can latch on. A compound called saponin, also derived from plants and trees, is also added to boost the immune response.\n",
      "The NVX‑CoV2373 vaccine aims to produce anti spike antibodies that can block SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n",
      "Status development: As of November 30, Novavax said in a statement that it has completed the enrollment of its 15,000-patient UK Phase 3 trial. The company added that has fully enrolled the Phase 2b trial in South Africa.\n",
      "“Novavax expects its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States and Mexico to begin in the coming weeks. More than 100 trial sites have been selected with some alternate sites in place, should they be needed,” the company added.\n",
      "Roll-out: Since the vaccine is still in its early trial stages, there is still no expected release date.\n",
      "However, the Indian pharmaceutical company Serum Institute of India (SII) previously committed to making the Novavax vaccine available in the country once it is developed.\n",

      "[Content]\n",
      "Several months and over 400,000 COVID-19 cases later, the Philippines has begun its long-awaited and promised process of acquiring vaccines as a means to end the pandemic. As early as April, President Duterte spoke optimistically of the prospects of a vaccine. Realistically, however, we must be aware of the realities of vaccination in the recent past in order to truly ensure its success.\n",
      "Before looking at the advances of COVID-19 vaccine technology, it is important to look at the role immunization has played in the Philippine health care system. Indeed, this has been one of the cornerstones of preventive care for disease not just of childhood (mumps, chickenpox) but eventual adult concerns (HPV, pneumonia) as well. Yet despite the government’s Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) and the National Immunization Program (NIP), the country has seen a drop in population coverage, leading to the resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses such as measles, diphtheria, and even poliomyelitis in the past decade. The Philippines’ circulating vaccine-derived polio cases in 2019-2020 placed us on a list with African countries struggling to end the transmission of this disease.Many attribute the dismal immunization coverage to the dengue vaccine scandal, but while it doubtless eroded vaccines confidence in the Philippines, our immunization programs have actually been problematic long before Dengvaxia, failing to reach the coverage goal of 95 percent for many years now. The scandal only represented the nadir of what’s already been an alarming trend.\n",
      "In fact, when it comes to timeliness of vaccination, the 2017 National Demographic and Health Survey showed only a 10.6 percent rate for all vaccines (ranging from 38 to 67 percent per vaccine). The gaps in delivery boil down to the quality and accessibility of our public health system, which, during the recent polio vaccinations, for instance, relied heavily on private sector support. It also faces a lot of challenges when it comes to maintaining the cold chain.\n",
      "Looking forward to the COVID-19 vaccines, there have been major breakthroughs, the speed and complexity of which have never been encountered before. Of those nearing approval, there are two mRNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer—both requiring negative temperatures in their delicate handling. There are also the vector-based vaccines from Astra-\n",
      "Zeneca and Gamaleya’s Sputnik V, as well as China’s inactivated vaccines developed by Sinopharm and Sinovac, all of which will only need normal refrigerated temperature.\n",
      "Beyond the vaccine type, its corresponding handling, and the limitations of our health infrastructure, a major concern is the potential politicization of the acquisition, prioritization, and distribution protocols that will be put in place. There have been conflicting reports on who will be vaccinated first—health workers, vulnerable individuals, the poor, and uniformed personnel—according to different government agencies. There is also a need to address people’s concerns about the vaccines, from fears of being made “guinea pigs” to misconceptions about side effects and efficacy.\n",
      "Surprisingly, there are reports of politicians having already received the vaccine, even if no emergency use authorizations have been granted by the local FDA. The vaccine “czar,” Gen. Carlito Galvez Jr., also mentioned that equitable access to the vaccine will only be achieved by 2022—an election year, which may bring about a predicament not unlike that of Dengvaxia in 2016, which some quarters allege was funded and launched for political considerations. These issues once again raise the danger of politicizing vaccination, especially if the process for prioritization will have potential interference from vested interests. With the urgency called for by the still uncontrolled pandemic, the success of not just the COVID-19 vaccine, but also of the entire vaccination institution in our country, hangs in the balance.\n",
      "In the end, however, the solution for COVID-19 goes beyond vaccination. The World Health Organization reminds governments of the continuous need to strengthen their countries’ health system to provide for adequate testing, tracing, quarantine, treatment, and monitoring, aside from the provision of essential services. States must invest in public health to strengthen the infrastructure for pandemic preparedness, and to ensure the well-being of all, now more than ever.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — A bill seeking to speed up the procurement and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the country and establish an indemnity fund now only needs the signature of President Rodrigo Duterte.\n",
      "This, after the House of Representatives, adopted the Senate’s version of the proposed Covid-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021.During the House session on Tuesday, the lower chamber approved a motion to adopt Senate Bill No. 2057 as an amendment to House Bill No. 8648, passed on Monday.\n",
      "READ: House OKs bill expediting Covid-19 vaccine purchase, creating indemnification fund\n",
      "With the House’s concurrence with the Senate bill, a bicameral conference committee will no longer be needed to reconcile the disagreeing provisions of the chambers’ respective versions of the measure.\n",
      "Under Senate Bill No. 2057, the national government, local government units (LGUs) and the private sector will be authorized to procure COVID-19 vaccines through the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) and the Department of Health (DOH).\n",
      "READ: Senate OKs bill expediting vaccine purchase, creating indemnity fund\n",
      "LGUs, on the other hand, will be allowed to directly procure the ancillary supplies and services necessary for the storage, transport, and deployment of the vaccines.\n",
      "The measure will also exempt LGUs from certain provisions of the existing procurement laws.\n",
      "Among the laws covered by the exemption are the Government Procurement Reform Act, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and the Local Government Code.\n",
      "“The bill will provide legal cover to the LGUs, many of which have intimated to us their concern about possible adverse findings by the Commission on Audit and even graft cases that may be filed against their officials,” Senator Sonny Angara, sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.A significant number of LGUs have started preparing for the rollout of their respective vaccination programs and are waiting for the bill’s enactment to exempt them from the legal requirements regarding the procurement of goods, the senator noted.\n",
      "For the private firms, their procurement of Covid-19 vaccines will be done in cooperation with the DOH and NTF through a multiparty agreement.\n",
      "Meanwhile, a national indemnity fund will be established under the bill to compensate any individual inoculated through the Covid-19 vaccination program, in case of death or for the treatment of possible severe adverse effects.\n",
      "The bill authorizes a P500-million augmentation, sourced from the Contingent Fund of the 2021 national budget to the existing funds of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth), which will manage the indemnity fund.\n",
      "“The indemnity fund will cover the indemnification agreements with the vaccine manufacturers, which the NTF has started fulfilling. This removes one major stumbling block to the delivery of the vaccines to the country,” Angara said.\n",
      "According to the senator, another provision of the bill seen to help bring in more Covid-19 vaccines and other critical supplies to the country is the exemption of its purchases from taxes and duties.\n",
      "Vaccine cards\n",
      "Under the bill, the DOH, LGUs and private entities will be required to issue “vaccine cards” to individuals who have been inoculated.\n",
      "The cards will contain basic information about the individual; the manufacturer and brand of the vaccine administered; the date of vaccination; the date of last RT-PCR testing; and the facility’s names where the vaccine was received and the health professionals who administered the vaccine.\n",
      "Senator Francis Tolentino introduced an amendment to the bill ensuring that the “vaccine card” to be issued by LGUs will not be considered a mandatory requirement in educational, employment, and similar government transaction purposes.\n",

Magkakaroon po tayo ng ganyan, and as we have said in the previous na mga pag-uusap, magkakaroon po tayo ng data registry for all recipients,” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said in an online press briefing.\n",
      "(We will have a vaccine passport, and as we have said in previous talks, we will have a data registry for all recipients.)\n",
      "According to Vergeire, a QR code will be given to every individual who would be vaccinated against COVID-19.\n",
      "“This would be something of a unique identifier for a specific person who will receive the vaccine, and dito magkakaroon din po sila ng card na nagsasabi na sila ay nabakunahan, either with one dose or two doses. This will serve as their certificate that they have been vaccinated,” she added.\n",

      "Vergeire said she believes that the vaccine passport, once it is widely implemented, will be part of protocols for border control in different countries.\n",
      "In December last year, Ang Probinsyano party-list Rep. Ronnie Ong filed House Bill No. 8280, or the Vaccination Passport Act, which seeks the issuance of vaccine passports for those who will receive vaccine shots during the country’s mass vaccination program against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte will be given the COVID-19 vaccine once it becomes available in the Philippines, but he will be vaccinated behind closed doors, Malacañang said on Tuesday.\n",
      "Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the public would be informed if the vaccine had been administered to Mr. Duterte.Roque was answering a question about the President’s willingness to take the first shot of CoronaVac, the COVID-19 vaccine made by the Chinese company Sinovac Biotech.\n",
      "‘No problem’\n",
      "He said he had talked to Mr. Duterte about the question and the President had responded, “No problem, I will take the vaccine as soon as it is available.”\n",
      "The President knows he has to be inoculated against COVID-19, Roque said.\n",
      "“But he said it does not have to be shown to the public. He is taking the route of the British sovereign because the decision of Queen Elizabeth and her husband was to make their vaccination private,” he added.\n",

      "The Philippines is expected to receive next month the first 50,000 doses of the 25 million doses of CoronaVac it is planning to buy.\n",
      "Also expected next month is the first batch of the vaccine made by the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer. The Pfizer vaccine is the first to be granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",

      "Emergency use permit\n",
      "The Department of Health (DOH), however, said any donated vaccine could not be used in the country without being granted emergency use authorization by the FDA.Sinovac has applied for emergency permit for CoronaVac with the FDA, but the regulator has found the company’s papers incomplete.\n",
      "The government aims to begin immunization next month, hoping to inoculate 70 million people, or two-thirds of the country’s population, this year.\n",
      "The Philippines has one of the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in Asia.\n",
      "On Tuesday, the DOH reported 1,357 additional coronavirus infections, raising the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country to 504,804.\n",
      "The DOH said 324 more patients had recovered, bringing the total number of COVID-19 survivors to 466,249. But the death toll rose to 9,978 with the deaths of 69 more patients.\n",

      "Even if the Philippines has submitted the indemnification agreement required by the COVAX vaccine pool of the World Health Organization (WHO), Pfizer-BioNTech still has to submit its own indemnification agreement that also has to be signed before the delivery can start, according to WHO representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe. “What the Philippines signed is the COVAX indemnification agreement. Unfortunately, we are still waiting for an indemnification agreement coming from the manufacturer, in this case it’s Pfizer-BioNTech,” Abeyasinghe said at the televised public briefing on Thursday.Agreement not sent out\n",
      "The Pfizer-BioNTech agreement has not been sent out to any of the countries involved in the early rollout, Abeyasinghe said.\n",
      "He said COVAX and the GAVI vaccine alliance were working closely with Pfizer-BioNTech to make sure it would send out the indemnification agreement.\n",
      "The indemnification agreement would absolve manufacturers of liability in case of adverse effects of vaccines, which have been authorized only for emergency use.\n",
      "Carlito Galvez Jr., who is in charge of the government’s vaccine program, said the Philippines had signed the indemnification agreements for COVAX and the different manufacturers, and only needed Pfizer and AstraZeneca to submit their own indemnification agreements.\n",
      "Galvez said there were two kinds indemnification agreements for COVAX, a generic one and a specific indemnification clause that must be signed by both the manufacturer and the Philippine government.\n",
      "He noted that the delay in the delivery of vaccines from COVAX is not just in the Philippines but worldwide.\n",
      "The Philippines is expecting an initial delivery of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine from COVAX this month. These were supposed to arrive mid-February but were delayed, with officials citing the need to sign the indemnity agreements.\n",
      "The Philippines is also awaiting the delivery of 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine donated by China, but these may no longer arrive on Feb. 23 as had been expected.\n",
      "Still no FDA approvalChina would deliver the vaccines to the Philippines only if the drug maker, Sinovac Biotech, got an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), according to presidential spokesperson Harry Roque.\n",
      "“I have received information that unless the [emergency use authorization] is delivered today, the delivery on the 23rd may be delayed,” Roque said.\n",
      "But it would be better to wait for the permit so that the vaccines could be used immediately once these arrived, he said. And if the application for the permit is denied, then at least the Philippines knows it could not use the Sinovac vaccine, he added.\n",
      "The FDA said it could not give a time frame for the grant of emergency use authorization to Sinovac.\n",
      "“We are still evaluating their latest submissions. I can’t give a time frame until all submissions are evaluated,” FDA chief Eric Domingo told the Inquirer in a text message.\n",
      "The delay triggered comparison between the Philippines and the poorer South Asian country Bangladesh, which has already started vaccinating its citizens.\n",
      "But Galvez said the vaccines used in Bangladesh were donated by its neighbor India.\n",
      "“We cannot inject donated vaccines without an [emergency use authorization],” he said.Despite these developments, Galvez said he believed it was still possible for the country’s vaccination drive to start this month. “Realistically, February is still possible,” he said.\n",
      "The emergency use authorization for Sinovac could be issued and the COVAX vaccines could be delivered, he said. Galvez said his team would meet with officials from Pfizer Global on Friday.\n",
      "Vaccines from South Korea\n",
      "As for the AstraZeneca vaccine, he said his team was negotiating with AstraZeneca Philippines, expecting that the vaccines to be procured by the government and those to be donated through COVAX would be supplied by AstraZeneca Thailand.\n",
      "The team, however, learned a few days ago that the vaccines would come from AstraZeneca South Korea instead.\n",
      "Galvez said Serum Institute of India, which also manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine, was ready to supply the Philippines, but it was following a manufacturing system that had designated countries to supply.\n",
      "“This means there is a supply problem,” he said.\n",
      "Under the government’s plan, the initial rollout of the vaccines is expected in the first quarter of the year, with workers in government-run hospitals, elderly people, and uniformed personnel as the priority groups.\n",
      "Some 5 million to 10 million doses are expected to arrive in the first two quarters of the year, Galvez said. The full rollout is scheduled in the third quarter, when the bulk of the vaccines is expected to be delivered.\n",
      "The government aims to vaccinate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year.\n",
      "Galvez also said there was still time to train vaccinators for the rollout since the vaccines would not arrive in the country at the same time.\n",
      "He said he had directed local governments to prepare vaccination sites and to recruit and train people to administer the vaccines. —WITH REPORTS FROM MARICAR CINCO, PATRICIA DENISE M. CHIU AND JEROME ANING\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines —President Rodrigo Duterte issued a stern warning on Monday night to all government employees: “Do not hinder or obstruct the smooth flow [of COVID-19 vaccines], which you can see now, from the time of arrival to the time of clearance.”In his pre-recorded briefing, Duterte said people not involved in the transport and storage of the vaccines should not interfere as only the Inter-Agency Task Force against Emerging Infectious Disease (IATF) was authorized to take charge of anything related to the vaccines.\n",
      "He mentioned the Bureau of Customs, saying partly in Filipino: “Your only job at Customs is to look [at the documents]. You have no business opening [the shipments].You are not allowed to do that. I am not allowing you, anybody there at the airport, to open [them].”\n",
      "Duterte told Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., the IATF chief implementer who oversees the vaccine procurement and the immunization program, to tap Philippine National Police (PNP) to provide escorts to help in speeding up the transport of the vaccines to local governments.\n",
      "He also urged officials involved in the delivery of the vaccines from the country’s ports of entry to review their roles during dry-runs that the government would conduct.\n",
      "“What they call ‘hagad’ will provide the fastest way of doing it,” he said, using a colloquial term for members of the Highway Patrol Group.\n",
      "The Philippines last lagged behind its Southeast Asian neighbors in getting COVID-19 vaccines.However, the IATF assured that the vaccines would arrive soon —sometime this month to early March.\n",
      "Local governments, especially those in Metro Manila, have been constantly preparing their vaccination programs so by the time that the vaccines arrive, they can efficiently administer them to their citizens.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the IATF has been moving from local government to another to ensure that they would be ready for the storage, delivery, and administration of the vaccines.\n",
      "Duterte reiterated that government employees should heed the orders of the IATF officials — Galvez, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.“They call the shots there — nobody else — in the matter of ensuring the smooth operation of this vaccine, reaching it to its ultimate beneficiary, the people,” Duterte stressed.\n",
      "As of Monday, the Department of Health said there were over 27,000 active COVID-19 cases, with 499,772 recoveries and 11,231deaths.The government is optimistic, however, that numbers will go down as vaccinations start, moving towards attaining herd immunity by immunizing over 70 million Filipinos.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has signed into law a measure that would expedite the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines and establish a P500-million indemnity fund, Malacañang confirmed Friday.\n",
      "“We are confident that the signing of this landmark piece of legislation would expedite the procurement and administration of vaccines for the protection against Covid-19,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a statement.Otherwise known as the “Covid-19 Vaccination Program Act of 2021,” the new law authorizes the national government, local government units (LGUs), and the private sector to procure vaccines against the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which causes the respiratory illness, through the National Task Force Against Covid-19 (NTF) and Department of Health (DOH).\n",
      "It also allows LGUs to directly procure the ancillary supplies and services necessary for the storage, transport, and deployment of the vaccines.\n",
      "Further, it exempts LGUs from certain provisions of existing procurement laws such as the Government Procurement Reform Act, the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, and the Local Government Code in their bid to obtain Covid-19 jabs.\n",
      "Another salient point of the new law is the P500 million national indemnity fund to compensate any individual vaccinated against Covid-19, in case of death or for the treatment of the vaccine’s possible adverse effects.\n",
      "The indemnity fund will be managed by state insurer Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) and will be sourced from the contingent fund under the 2021 national budget.\n",
      "According to the government, the lack of an indemnity deal earlier has delayed the delivery of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines that were initially expected to arrive in the country in mid-February.\n",

      "“As of yesterday, a total of 8,559 individuals have received the first doses of the Sinovac vaccine, which were administered from March 1 to March 3 in 32 different sites in the National Capital Region,” Nograles said in an online briefing.The Philippines began its COVID-19 vaccination program after receiving 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s vaccine, CoronaVac, donated by the Chinese government.\n",
      "Of the 600,000 doses, Nograles said 189,600 have already been delivered in various vaccination centers across the country.\n",
      "“At this point, we acknowledge that we have countrymen who still have reservations about receiving vaccines; but we believe that our kababayan should take their cue from the doctors, nurses, and medical personnel who have received the first doses of the vaccine,” Nograles said.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said the government is eyeing to vaccinate all health workers in the country within this month.\n",
      "The Philippines expects to receive on Thursday night 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines donated from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The World Health Organization (WHO) is considering three Covid-19 vaccines for its solidarity trials, but the date on when this activity would commence remains uncertain, the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) said Friday.“We were told that they [WHO] are down to three choices of vaccines and we will know soon kung kailan po mag-uumpisa itong trials [when the trials would start],” DOST Undersecretary Rowena Cristina Guevara said in an online press briefing, but did not disclose which vaccines are being considered by the WHO.\n",
      "According to Guevara, the occurrence of new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and other factors in the vaccines have contributed to the delay in the conduct of solidarity trials.\n",
      "She said the country’s team for the solitary trials is ready and has been preparing for the activity since September last year.\n",
      "“We have been in touch with the WHO solidarity vaccine trials global lead and we were informed that the vaccine selection from their end still has to be finalized,” she added.\n",
      "“Malaki ang naging epekto kasi nitong paglabas ng variants at nakita din nila ‘yung mahirap kapag double dose ang ating mga vaccines [The occurrence of variants had a large effect and they saw that using double dose vaccines would be difficult], so they are trying to find better alternatives to the vaccines that are available,” she added.\n",
      "As for preparations for the trials in the Philippines, Guevara said one of the challenges is the increased requirement in the number of staff for the initiative due to the increased number of trial sites and participants.\n",
      "She noted that Covid-19 cases in Metro Manila are also changing, causing difficulty in identifying the final list of trial sites.\n",
      "“The study vaccines are not yet released by the WHO including the final trial protocols and standard operating procedures, causing delay in the implementation of the trial,” she added.\n",
      "Currently, available Covid-19 vaccines are only being administered through emergency use authorization (EUA), which allows the limited use of vaccines that are deemed safe and effective based on review of interim data of Phase 3 clinical trials.Guevara reiterated that the EUA is different from a product registration, which is being issued for new and approved vaccines that were proven safe and effective based on review of complete data from Phase 3 trials.\n",
      "Outside the WHO solidarity trials, there are also vaccine manufacturers that have applied to conduct their independent clinical trials in the Philippines.\n",
      "Guevara said Belgium-based Janssen Pharmaceuticals has already started its phase 3 clinical trials in the country, while trial site preparations are ongoing for Chinese firms Clover Biopharmaceuticals and Sinovac Biotech.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines is aiming to purchase some 148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and inoculate at least 50 million Filipinos in 2021, National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Wednesday.\n",
      "But Galvez noted that it would still depend on the global supply, noting that developed countries already secured 80 percent of the vaccines worldwide.“Based on our current negotiations, we will be able to purchase at least 148 million doses from more or less seven manufacturers. However, it will be dependent on the global supply,” Galvez said in a televised briefing.\n",
      "“Sa ilalim po ng Philippine National Vaccine roadmap, babakunahan po natin ang humigit kumulang 50 to 70 million na Filipino sa loob ng taong ito [we will vaccinate more or less 50 to 70 million Filipinos within the year],” he added.\n",
      "Galvez said the Philippines is already in “advanced stages of negotiations” with pharmaceutical companiesNovavax, AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson, Sinovac and Gamaleya.\n",
      "“We hope to close the deal with these companies this month,” he said.\n",
      "Apart from these negotiations, Galvez said the Philippines is guaranteed to receive COVID-19 vaccines for 22 million Filipinos from the Covax Facility.\n",

We have already locked in the supply of 106 to 108 million doses including po yung sa single dose,” Galvez said in a pre-recorded meeting with President Rodrigo Duterte.\n",
      "Galvez did not identify the vaccine manufacturers that are involved in supplying the Philippines with the Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "But previously, the government already announced having secured vaccines from China’s Sinovac, British drugmaker AstraZeneca, U.S. companies Pfizer and Moderna, and the Serum Institute of India.\n",
      "“All in all, by this February, second week, we’re trying to come up with the supply agreements with the vaccine manufacturers and we will also include the two remaining contracts we are negotiating,” said Galvez.\n",
      "“We are expecting up to 146 to 148 million doses. This is excluding the COVAX [facility where] we are assured to have more or less 40 million doses,” he added.\n",
      "The Philippines is expecting to receive at least 5.6 million Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and AstraZeneca within the first quarter of the year, Galvez said.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The Cavite provincial government has allotted P750 million for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines for its more than 1.5 million residents, Gov. Jonvic Remulla said in a Facebook post on Monday.\n",
      "Remulla said provincial officials had started talks with British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca over its COVID-19 vaccine, which would be for those aged 18 to 59 years old.“Astra Zeneca is proven 60-91% effective in preventing COVID-19,” Remulla said in his post.\n",
      "According to him, they are waiting for a response from American pharmaceutical firms Moderna and Pfizer about buying vaccines suitable for senior citizens — that is, those aged 60 and above.\n",
      "Previously, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said that the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines might be delayed for about a week due to supply problems.\n",
      "However, the initial batch of AstraZeneca vaccines came from the first round of allocated doses from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility. This would include 525,600 doses of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Other vaccines that local government units procured separately from the national government will come later.\n",
      "The Philippines started vaccinating government health workers and other frontliners on Monday, a day after the arrival of the Chinese government-donated COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac Biotech.Among the first to get inoculated were Philippine General Hospital Director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director-General Eric Domingo, and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Chairman Benhur Abalos.\n",
      "The government aims to vaccinate 70 million Filipinos in a bid to achieve herd immunity — that is, when a big enough percentage of the population becomes immune from the virus, either through vaccination or prior infection.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines —Only 19 percent of adult Filipinos are willing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and 46 percent are unwilling even if a safe and effective vaccine is available.\n",
      "This is the finding of a survey done by OCTA Research, a group of top academicians studying the coronavirus pandemic.According to the survey, the intent to get vaccines is lowest among respondents in Balance Luzon, which is at 14 percent, followed by the Visayas at 20 percent, Metro Manila at 25 percent, and Mindanao at 26 percent.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the number of those who would reject COVID-19 vaccination is highest in Balance Luzon and the Visayas at 47 percent, followed by Mindanao and Metro Manila at 43 percent each.\n",
      "Roughly a third, or 35 percent, were undecided if they would get vaccinated. Most of these were in Balance Luzon at 39 percent, followed by Metro Manila at 31 percent, the Visayas at 33 percent, and Mindanao at 32 percent.\n",
      "The top reason for not getting the vaccine, given by 73 percent of respondents, was a concern for the safety of the vaccines, followed by doubt about their efficacy.\n",
      "Concern for vaccine safety was higher in Mindanao at 78 percent and in Balance Luzon at 76 percent, compared to Metro Manila at 69 percent and in the Visayas at 64 percent.\n",
      "One alarming figure that the study found out is that 9 percent do not want to get the vaccine because they believe it is not needed to fight the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",
      "The two other reasons for not wanting to get vaccinated were “the vaccine is not free,” given by 6 percent of respondents, and “the vaccine is expensive,” given by 6 percent.\n",
      "The OCTA Research survey shows little variance between various socioeconomic classes’ in their sentiments towards the COVID-19 vaccine. Those willing to get vaccinated are 23 percent in Classes A, B, and C; 18 percent in Class D; and 23 percent in Class E.\n",
      "Those unwilling to get vaccinated are 45 percent in Classes A, B, and C; 46 percent in Class D; 44 percent in Class E.This is not the first survey on COVID-19 vaccination conducted by OCTA Research. Last January, the group released another study saying that only 25 percent of Metro Manila residents would want to get vaccinated.\n",
      "Aside from issues with COVID-19 vaccine procurement, the government is always questioned about its efforts to disseminate proper information about vaccines while assuring the public about its safety and efficacy.\n",
      "In a radio interview last January, Vice President Leni Robredo said that the government must craft an efficient communication plan that would clear up concerns with the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "While Malacañang rebuked Robredo for her suggestions — saying that these were already being carried out — the Vice President’s camp questioned why surveys done by different polling firms indicated low appreciation for COVID-19 vaccines.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte has allowed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to grant emergency use authorization (EUA) to expected COVID-19 vaccines that will be made available in the Philippines.\n",
      "In Executive Order No. 121 signed Dec. 1 and made public Wednesday, Duterte authorized the FDA director-general to issue a EUA to COVID-19 drugs or vaccines.The President also authorized the FDA director-general to “accept the regulatory decision of the [World Health Organization], [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], or other internationally recognized regulatory authorities.\n",
      "With the FDA allowed to issue EUAs, the process of approving COVID-19 vaccines will be shortened from six months to 21 days.\n",
      "According to the EO, conditions for the issuance of EUA to COVID-19 drug or vaccine are the following:\n",
      "Based on the totality of evidence available, including data from adequate and well-known controlled trials, it is reasonable to believe that the drug or vaccine may be effective to prevent, diagnose or treat COVID-19;\n",
      "The known and potential benefits of the drug or vaccine when used to diagnose, prevent or treat COVID-19 outweigh the known and potential risks of the drug or vaccine if any; and\n",
      "There is no adequate, approved and available alternative to the drug or vaccine for diagnosing, preventing or treating COVID-19\n",
      "Earlier, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III asked the President to grant the FDA with EUA to “cut the red tape.”\n",
      "Pfizer and Moderna are among the pharmaceutical firms who already applied for an EUA of their COVID-19 vaccines before U.S. health regulators.\n",
      "Meanwhile, COVID-19 vaccines of China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute have already secured EUA from their respective governments.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — As the country starts to prepare for the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines, some myths and fears with the immunization shot still linger.\n",
      "Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr., in a televised meeting on Tuesday, also cited the misinformation posted on social media by “anti-vaxxers” (people who disagree with the use of vaccines for a variety of reasons) as one of the causes of low confidence among Filipinos with receiving jabs of the incoming doses of vaccines.“This is a problem that needs to be addressed. We know that you will be of great help because the willingness of our countrymen to get vaccinated is decreasing due to the adverse effects of certain brands,” Galvez said, speaking in Filipino.\n",
      "“At the same time, anti-vaxxers have a strong social media presence. This is a big challenge,” he added.\n",
      "The Philippines is not the only country that is experiencing this. Anti-vaxxers are also a huge problem in the United States, especially now that they have started their inoculation campaign with batches of Pfizer-BioNTech’s vaccines.\n",
      "In a New York Times article published on Tuesday, Akiko Iwasaki, Waldemar von Zedtwitz Professor of Immunobiology at Yale School of Medicine, and Yale M.D.-Ph.D student Alice Lu-Culligan debunked a specific rumor — which they believe discourages women to get vaccinated against Covid-19.\n",
      "Myth: Covid-19 vaccines can make women infertile\n",
      "According to Iwasaki and Culligan, the rumor claims that certain vaccines can cause infertility “by generating antibodies that not only target the coronavirus spike protein, as designed, but also inadvertently react with a protein in the placenta called syncytin-1.”\n",
      "The vaccines’ antibodies, according to rumors, can attack the syncytin-1 and affect the development of the placenta because the coronavirus spike protein allegedly has a similar structure to the human protein.\n",
      "Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna uses mRNA, a genetic molecule that carries the instructions for making proteins in our body, to instruct cells to make a harmless spike protein similar to those of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\n",
      "These spikes and spike fragments in the cells will be recognized by the immune system and cause an immune response that produces antibodies that hinders the virus from attacking other cells.\n",
      "Explainer: Facts about 7 COVID-19 vaccines Philippines may getIwasaki and Culligan said that the “confusion is understandable,” since the US pharmaceutical companies Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna did not include research on pregnant and lactating women during their clinical trials.\n",
      "“But the valid concerns about this information void have been eclipsed by targeted misinformation campaigns led by vaccine skeptics who are weaponizing women’s health issues to advance their agenda. These falsehoods are being spread to amplify our legitimate anxieties and undermine trust in vaccination,” they added.\n",
      "Fact: Covid-19 vaccines are non-evasive to pregnant women\n",
      "An analysis by the Yale professor and student found that there was no similarity between the viral spikes and the placental protein. They also noted that there have been no official and scientific reports yet citing Covid-19 vaccines as a cause for infertility.\n",
      "In fact, they stated that some women were still able to get pregnant after receiving jabs of Covid-19 vaccines — either after contracting the disease or during the clinical trials of the vaccines.\n",
      "Both Iwasaki and Culligan added that the vaccines might also benefit both the lactating mother and the infant. They also quashed the myth that pregnant women and their baby can get Covid-19 from the vaccines.\n",
      "“[V]accines induce protective immune responses in the mother, creating antibodies that are passed to infants via breast milk and serve to protect them,” they said in the article.“[I]t is unlikely that the vaccine can cross into breast milk. Even if they did, they would not pose a threat to the health of a nursing baby; if ingested, these components would be digested and degraded in the gastrointestinal tract,” they added.\n",
      "However, they emphasized that the Covid-19 can indeed make pregnant women more susceptible to severe illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the dreaded disease can increase the risk of preterm labor (which means that the baby might be delivered too early or before the 37 weeks of pregnancy is completed.)\n",
      "“For any woman who is pregnant, nursing or trying to conceive, contracting Covid-19 is almost certainly more dangerous than getting immunized. And ultimately, mass vaccination, combined with physical distancing and wearing masks, provides the only way that we can end the pandemic and protect all women, men and children from the disease,” Iwasaki and Culligan said.\n",
      "Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine in PH\n",
      "The Philippines’ vaccine czar said the country might be able to acquire and rollout Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer-BioNTech by February via the COVAX Facility.\n",
      "Last week, Galvez announced that there will be at least 40 million doses from the COVAX Facility. But, contrary to his earlier statement, he stated that the coming vaccines might be manufactured either by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, COVAVAX of the Serum Institute of India, or Johnson & Johnson.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has signed an agreement with the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the supply of 30 million doses of the Covovax coronavirus vaccine.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez, Jr. signed the term sheet on behalf of the government. The vaccines will be available starting the third quarter of 2021.SII, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has partnered with Novavax, a U.S.-based biotechnology company for the development and commercialization of its Covovax vaccine.\n",
      "Covovax is in third-stage trials and expected to be approved for use by international regulators.\n",
      "“The vaccine will be used to vaccinate 15 million vulnerable and poor Filipinos. The vaccine is stable at 2°C to 8°C, the standard temperature that is within the existing cold chain system in the Philippines, thus allowing its distribution to the remotest barangays,” said Dr. Luningning Villa, medical director of Faberco Life Sciences Inc., SII’s Philippine partner.\n",
      "The price of the vaccine is expected to be finalized soon between the government and SII.\n",
      "So far, the Philippines has secured 2.6 million doses of vaccine from British drugmaker AstraZeneca through a tripartite agreement with local private firms. The vaccines are expected to arrive in the second quarter of 2021.\n",
      "The government is also in talks with other drugmakers such as Pfizer and Moderna of the United States, Sinovac Biotech and Sinopharm of China, and the Gamaleya Institute of Russia.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The initial batch of COVID-19 vaccines from the global vaccine sharing scheme COVAX is expected to arrive in the country by mid-February, Malacañang said on Monday as it gave an assurance that the government would be ready to launch its vaccination drive next week.\n",
      "Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said the government expected to hear from COVAX any time now on the exact date of the vaccines’ delivery, and said all preparations were in place once these arrived in the country.“The COVAX facility said it will arrive mid-February and as far as we’re concerned, as you can see from the report of the mayors, we are ready to begin the vaccination and we are ready to do it by Feb. 15,” Roque said at a press briefing.\n",
      "He said the Philippines would be given notice of the impending delivery two to three days before the vaccines are loaded in the aircraft so that it would have time to prepare to receive these at the airport.\n",
      "Initially from Pfizer\n",
      "The initial shipment from the global procurement pool would be 117,000 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which would require subzero temperatures for storage, he said.\n",
      "They would be kept in the Department of Health (DOH) warehouse before being distributed to COVID-19 referral hospitals, he said.\n",
      "He also said Pfizer would be responsible for bringing the vaccines to the areas where these would be used.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Duterte, who earlier expressed preference for the Chinese or Russian vaccine, will be given priority in the vaccination because he is a senior citizen, Roque said.\n",
      "It is also important for him to get the shot to inspire public confidence, he said.\n",
      "“We expect him to be among the first. Whether it is done publicly or privately will be his decision,” he said.\n",
      "The DOH on Monday said local governments in Metro Manila and metropolitan Cebu and Davao must have set up their vaccination operation centers by Feb. 10.Speaking at an online briefing, Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje, who is in charge of the DOH public health service team, said the centers would be in charge of the vaccine rollout in local areas with contingency measures in place to address any problem.\n",
      "“They will help us see the entirety to the implementation of the vaccine rollout. There will be planning, policy [awareness], dissemination of guidelines—there will just be one source of our information. There will be logistics [employees] who will be in charge of the vaccines, if the ancillaries are there,” Cabotaje said.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The national government has announced that it is already prepared for the expected rollout of Covid-19 vaccines in the country this month.\n",
      "The government has also recently approved and ratified its plan for mass immunization against Covid-19. The detailed list of the priority population for the scheduled inoculation has also been released last week.While it seems like everything is underway for the country’s vaccination program, several doctors and medical experts clarified that there is a certain group of individuals who are not advised to receive jabs of Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Who should not receive shots of the Covid-19 vaccine?\n",
      "According to Dr. Anna Ong-Lim, a pediatric infectious disease expert and Department of Health (DOH) technical advisory group member, there is currently only one contraindication to Covid-19 vaccination.\n",
      "“Currently yung nag-iisang contraindication is yung anaphylaxis or a severe allergy to a previous dose,” Lim said in an online briefing on Monday, explaining that those who will experience this contraindication will not be allowed to take further doses of Covid-19 vaccine.\n",
      "(Currently, the only contraindication is anaphylaxis or a severe allergy to a previous dose of Covid-19 vaccine.)\n",
      "The guidelines set by the Philippine Society of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (PSAAI) stated that: “Patients who have experienced an immediate allergic reaction, whether mild (e.g.rashes) or severe (e. g. anaphylaxis) to Covid-19 vaccine after the first dose should not receive the second dose.”\n",
      "“Patients who have a history of allergic reaction or anaphylaxis to certain vaccine excipients such as polyethylene glycol (PEG) (which can also be found in colonoscopy preparation, or laxatives) or to polysorbate (which can be found in vascular graft materials, surgical gels, PEGylated medications) should not receive the Covid-19 vaccines.”\n",
      "The persons mentioned by PSAAI, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), should not receive vaccine shots either from Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, since PEG is a component of the mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine.\n",
      "The patients are also advised by PSAAI to be referred to an allergist for further evaluation.\n",
      "“Patients who have experienced an immediate allergic reaction, such as urticaria, angioedema, difficulty of breathing, regardless of severity, to any OTHER vaccine or\n",
      "injected therapy must be evaluated by an allergist to assess possible allergic reactions to PEG or polysorbate. All vaccinated patients should be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination,” PSAAI added.“Wala pa naman tayong nababakunahan so di natin masasabi,” said Dr. Carmela Kasala of the Philippine Pediatric Society, adding that it is crucial to monitor for any adverse effects following the first round of Covdi-19 vaccination in the country.\n",
      "(We have yet to start vaccinating people so it is hard to say.)\n",
      "“Yung mga on the second round natin kung nag react siya sa unang vaccine na binigay sa kanya, ‘di na po pwede ibigay yung pangalawang shot kasi baka maging fatal pa yung mangyari but this is very rare,” Kasala added.\n",
      "(During the second round of vaccination, if the person severely reacted to the first dose, he/she can not get the second dose or shot because it might become fatal — although that kind of situation is very rare.)\n",
      "Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) enumerated the following conditions that may disqualify a person from getting the coronavirus vaccine, specifically the Pfizer-BioNTech product:\n",
      "extreme allergic reactions\n",
      "pregnant and breastfeeding women\n",
      "children\n",
      "Can immunocompromised persons get Covid-19 vaccines?\n",
      "Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Friday said that immunocompromised individuals cannot receive jabs of Covid-19 vaccine due to adverse effects.\n",
      "“‘Yong mga immunocompromised, ‘yong kanilang immune system na mahina o may tama, ay hindi natin pwedeng bigyan ng bakuna,” he told reporters in an ambush interview.\n",
      "(Immunocompromised individuals, those whose immune systems are either weak or have taken a hit we cannot give them vaccines.)\n",
      "Duque cited previous reports that some elderly people with underlying health conditions in Norway have died after getting inoculated with vaccine from the PfizerBioNTech.\n",
      "However, according to the Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (GACVS), a committee which acts as a scientific and clinical advisory body to the WHO, there is no evidence yet linking the reported deaths of elderly people and PfizerBioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine.\n",
      "“The current reports do not suggest any unexpected or untoward increase in fatalities in frail, elderly individuals or any unusual characteristics of adverse events following administration of BNT162b2,” GACVS said in a statement last month.\n",
      "“Reports are in line with the expected, all-cause mortality rates and causes of death in the sub-population of frail, elderly individuals, and the available information does not confirm a contributory role for the vaccine in the reported fatal events,” the committee added.\n",
      "Health reform advocate Dr. Tony Leachon and kidney specialist Dr. Carlo Trinidad also disputed what they described as an “irresponsible” and “misleading” statement by Duque.\n",
      "“Sec. Duque should rectify and qualify this misleading information. We will deprive the people who will surely benefit from vaccination,” Leachon said in a Twitter post on Friday.\n",
      "“I think [Duque is] confused or tired. Perhaps he must consult his vaccine expert panel.As long as these are not live attenuated vaccines, they hold no specific risk to an immunocompromised patient, other than any factors specific to the individual that could be a contraindication,” Leachon said in a separate Tweet.\n",
      "Meanwhile, according to Trinidad, “Pfizer trials included patients with baseline comorbidities such as those with CANCER, AIDS, DIABETES, LEUKEMIA, LIVER DISEASE.”\n",
      "Based on the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), Covid-19 vaccines that use mRNAs such as PfizerBioNTech and Moderna’s vaccines are “unlikely to pose a safety risk” for transplant patients since it is not a live vaccine.\n",
      "“[B]ecause immunocompromised people may be at risk for severe COVID-19, CDC recommends these groups may still receive the vaccine if there are no contraindications,” the US-based medical association explained on its website.\n",
      "“Transplant recipients should be counseled that the effectiveness and safety profile of these vaccines for them are not currently known,” IDSA added.\n",
      "On the other hand, oncology patients, which IDSA said “many of whom are immunocompromised either by virtue of their disease of cancer or their treatment, e.g., chemotherapy, radiation, stem cell transplant,” can also get Covid-19 vaccines if they have no contraindications to vaccination.\n",
      "However, since there are still limited data on the vaccines’ safety profile and efficacy in immunocompromised populations, IDSA suggested counseling patients before taking vaccine shots for Covid-19.\n",
      "IDSA likewise clarified that patients with autoimmune diseases can be inoculated against Covid-19.\n",
      "“Autoimmune disease is not a contraindication for the mRNA vaccines. The study populations for both mRNA vaccine trials included participants with autoimmune disease.”\n",
      "“No imbalances were observed in the occurrence of symptoms consistent with autoimmune conditions or inflammatory disorders in clinical trial participants who received an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine compared to placebo.”\n",
      "What about other allergic reactions and conditions?\n",
      "CDC said those who have a food allergy, pet allergy, environmental allergies, and allergies to oral medications (including the oral equivalents of injectable medications) can and should get Covid-19 vaccine shots.\n",
      "The agency explained that allergic reactions “not related to vaccines, injectable therapies, components of mRNA Covid-19 vaccines (including PEG), or polysorbates” are not considered a contraindication or precaution to Covid-19 vaccination.\n",
      "“Hindi po totoo na contraindication kung may mag allergies kayo o asthma o may food allergy or drug allergy, hindi po totoo na hindi niyo pwedeng ma-receive ang bakuna. Pwede po [kayo mabakunahan],” Kasala emphasized.\n",
      "(It is not true that yous should not get Covid-19 vaccine if you have allergies, asthma, food allergy, or drug allergy. You can still get vaccinated.)\n",
      "“‘Wag po matakot. Isipin natin mas maraming benepisyo sa paglagay sa bakuna kesa sa wala tayong bakuna,” she added.\n",
      "(Do not be afraid. Just think about it, there are more benefits in receiving Covid-19 vaccines than having none.)\n",
      "Also included in PSAAI’s “special group” who can receive Covid-19 vaccines are:\n",
      "Patients with allergic reactions (of any severity) to food, inhalant/environmental allergens, insects, latex, oral medications, not related to vaccines and their components, can receive Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Patients with immunodeficiency and autoimmune disease (e.g. Guillain-Barre Syndrome, Bell’s palsy) may also get vaccinated but they should be informed that there is still not enough data available to establish vaccine safety and efficacy in these conditions.\n",
      "Patients with well-controlled asthma and on inhaled corticosteroids, and those with allergic rhinitis on intranasal corticosteroids can receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\n",

      "The Philippine government would not shoulder any of the costs, Guevara added.\n",
      "The DOST earlier said Janssen would likely conduct trials in the cities of San Pablo and Cabuyao in Laguna province, La Paz in Iloilo province, and Metro Manila.\n",
      "Johnson & Johnson said Janssen’s vaccine was found to be 72-percent effective in its United States trials.The company also said the vaccine was “85-percent effective overall in preventing severe disease and demonstrated complete protection against COVID-19-related hospitalization and death as of Day 28.”\n",
      "Janssen’s vaccine is a single shot unlike the vaccines produced by Pfizer and AstraZeneca, which require two jabs to be fully effective.\n",
      "Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque on Saturday said the delay in the delivery of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines was due to their requirement of a government assurance that they would not be hailed to court in the same way that Sanofi Pasteur was following the Dengvaxia fiasco.\n",
      "Indemnification fund\n",
      "“All of us are getting impatient. But the manufacturers, Pfizer, Astrazeneca, became afraid and want to have assurance that what happened to Dengvaxia would not happen to them, when the manufacturer of that vaccine was sued,” Roque said during his appearance at a television noontime show.\n",
      "Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. on Thursday said that it already had an indemnification agreement with AstraZeneca.\n",
      "“For the information of everyone, in our initial negotiations, Pfizer wasn’t asking for that, just only now, that’s why we were a bit surprised because the only one that insisted on what we call indemnity clause was Johnson & Johnson,” Galvez said.\n",
      "Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Saturday said the passage of a law creating an indemnification fund would speed up negotiations for COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Vergeire said the indemnification agreement with vaccine manufacturers was the main challenge for the country at the moment.\n",
      "Urgent measure\n",
      "President Duterte certified as urgent the measure to create an indemnity fund to help those who would experience adverse effects from the COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Speaker Lord Allan Velasco has committed passage on Monday of his House Bill No. 8648, which provides, among others, an indemnification fund.\n",
      "Vergeire explained that all drug manufacturers required an indemnification agreement because the vaccines were still under development, and they would not want any liability for their emergency use.\n",
      "Other countries already have existing laws for indemnification, she noted.\n",
      "“The reason we are having more difficulty in negotiation is because we do not have a law to support this indemnification agreement. This is why we are urging Congress to approve this law so that the negotiations would move more quickly,” Vergeire said at Saturday’s Laging Handa briefing.\n",
      "Informed consent\n",
      "But while the law is not yet in place, she said the Philippines negotiated with vaccine manufacturers to come up with specific documents to address their concerns, such as the informed consent form that would include the liability waiver statement.\n",
      "“We are ensuring [to] them that no liability will be charged against them in case there would be adverse events,” she added.\n",
      "Once the indemnification agreement has been ironed out, and especially if the indemnification fund law has been passed, negotiations with vaccine manufacturers and with the COVAX facility would move swiftly, Vergeire said.\n",
      "“And that would facilitate the arrival of the vaccines into the country,” she added.\n",
      "Vergeire also said the Dengvaxia issue was “beside the point.”\n",

There’s a scramble [for vaccines] now,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino.According to him, procurement laws have not made it easy for the country to get vaccines, as the government could not“play” with public funds.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — Poor infrastructure and the lack of cold storage facilities in the countryside would slow down the Philippines’ vaccination program, which targets to inoculate the entire population by 2023, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) said Tuesday.\n",
      "Citing earlier projections from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), ADB said in a report that it would take the Philippines up to the fourth quarter of 2023 to finish vaccinating the rest of its population after prioritizing vulnerable groups.Compared to other Asean countries, vaccination rollout in the Philippines would lag behind Singapore’s plan to finish inoculation by the fourth quarter of this year, Vietnam’s by the second quarter of next year, Brunei Darussalam and Thailand in the third quarter of 2022, Malaysia in the second quarter of 2023, and Indonesia by the third quarter of 2023.\n",
      "The Philippines’ timetable to vaccinate the entire population was the same as in Bangladesh, Nepal, Samoa, and Tonga.\n",
      "A picture shows the logo of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) displayed outside its headquarters in Manila on September 2, 2010. AFP FILE PHOTO/TED ALJIBE\n",
      "Poorer Southeast Asian countries like Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Timor-Leste may take up to 2024 or beyond to vaccinate all of their respective populations.\n",
      "“In the Philippines, it is difficult to access rural and remote communities due to unpredictable weather, security concerns, and poor infrastructure. Inadequate provision of transportation has seen health care workers resort to hiring private motorcycles and pump boats to deliver and administer vaccines,” the ADB brief titled “Getting Ready for the COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout” read.\n",
      "“Refrigerators in health centers in rural areas are subject to intermittent power supply with no backup power source. Vaccine wastage also occurs owing to a lack of skilled personnel,” it added.\n",
      "Citing 2020 data by logistics firm DHL, ADB said cold chain logistics in the Philippines scored four out of five as the highest score in terms of preparedness for facilities that required conventional temperature requirements or about 2-8 degrees Celsius, which AstraZeneca vaccines, for instance, needed as storage temperature.\n",
      "But in case vaccines needed stringent temperature requirements of as low as negative 80 degrees Celsius, cold chain facilities in the Philippines scored only two out of five. Pfizer vaccines, in particular, need to be stored at as low as negative 70 degrees Celsius.\n",
      "In an earlier report, ADB said the Philippines faced constraints in vaccine financing as “the government estimates that P82.5 billion (about $1.7 billion) will be required to provide vaccines to approximately 55 percent of the country’s population—still short of its plan to vaccinate all Filipinos by 2023.”\n",
      "Citing the vaccine allocation plan prepared by the Department of Health (DOH), ADB had said the Philippine government targeted to vaccinate 25.35 million Filipinos in 2021, 44.63 million in 2022, and 41.77 million in 2023 since by that time the Philippines would have a total population of 112.89 million.To help buy vaccines, ADB earlier realigned $25 million out of its $125-million health system enhancement to address and limit (Heal) COVID-19 project loan extended in August last year so the Philippines can settle $50 million in advance payments in January this year for six vaccine supply agreements.\n",
      "In all, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) last December released to DOH P2.76 billion or $55 million from two earlier loans renegotiated with the ADB and the World Bank.\n",
      "Together with the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), which would chip-in $300 million, the ADB’s $400-million contribution to the second health system enhancement to address and limit Covid-19 (Heal 2) will finance the bulk of the $764.17-million project cost mainly to procure Covid-19 vaccines, the Inquirer reported last week.\n",
      "Together with the forthcoming World Bank loan amounting to $500 million, the three multilateral lenders would inject a total of $1.2 billion into the Philippines’ nationwide vaccination program upon approval by their respective boards all expected in March.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — There’s a “compelling legal basis” to grant the people’s request for the publication of COVID-19 vaccine prices even in the face of a pandemic, the Integrated Bar of the Philippines (IBP) said in a statement issued on Monday.\n",
      "“Transparency is helpful in establishing facts, dispelling doubts and suspicions, countering propaganda, minimizing political posturing, curbing corruption, promoting accountability, nurturing cooperation, and in enhancing trust in our country’s governance,” Domingo Cayosa, IBP national president, said.“It is good to let the people know more about the COVID 19 vaccines, the decisions to be made for them, and the public funds therefor.A well-informed citizenry will ‘heal as one,’ BETTER and FASTER,” he added.\n",
      "According to Cayosa, Constitution has two provisions that mandate the government to make full public disclosure in transactions that involves the public interest — in this case, vaccines against a pandemic.\n",
      "These provisions are Article II in Section 28 and Ariticle III in Section 7.\n",
      "Cayosa cited a case between former Solicitor General Francisco Chavez and the National Housing Authority which the Supreme Court decided citing those provisions.\n",
      "Quoting the decision, Cayosa said: ‘These provisions of the Constitution seek to promote transparency in policy-making and in the operations of the government, as well as provide the people sufficient information to exercise effectively other constitutional rights.”\n",
      "But Cayosa also mentioned that Executive Order No, 2 — signed by President Rodrigo Duterte himself — which provides a legal presumption favoring access to information.\n",
      "“Executive Order No. 2 which was signed by President Rodrigo Roa Duterte on July 23, 2016 provides that ‘There shall be a legal presumption in favor of access to information, public records and official records’,” Cayosa said.\n",
      "“The Freedom of Information E.O. acknowledges that ‘the incorporation of this right in the Constitution is a recognition of the fundamental role of free and open exchange of information in a democracy, meant to enhance transparency and accountability in government official acts, transactions, or decisions’.It states that ‘the Executive Branch recognizes the urgent need to operationalize these Constitutional provisions’,” he added.\n",
      "Secretary Carllito Galvez Jr., vaccine czar and chief implementor of the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF), and other government officials have maintained that they could not divulge prices of the CoronaVac — the vaccine made by Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac BioTech. It is one of the vaccines that will be used by the national government.The huge discrepancy between the selling prices of CoronaVac in the Philippines and in other countries prompted questions on whether the Philippines’ procurement is riddled with corruption — leading to calls for the publication of prices.\n",
      "Last Sunday, Sen. Panfilo Lacson mentioned in a series of tweets that the Sinovac vaccine cost around $5, or around P240, per dose in some instances, but it costaround $38, or around P1,800, in the Philippines.\n",
      "Galvez still refused to reveal the price of the vaccines, saying that it would endanger the government’s deal with Sinovac, to which it was bound by a nondisclosure agreement.\n",
      "He did say that the vaccine cost was no more than P700.\n",
      "Sen. Sonny Angara insisted, however, that the original vaccine price — which had skyrocketed to over P3,600 per two doses — was revealed by the Department of Health around November.\n",
      "During his taped briefing on Monday, Duterte defended Galvez, assuring that the vaccine procurement was not riddled by corruption. He also justified the government’s adherence to the nondisclosure agreement, as it had been an “industry practice.”\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The national government has approved and ratified its plan for mass immunization against Covid-19 a year since the pandemic began in the country.\n",
      "In a memorandum dated Jan. 26 but was released to the media this Saturday, the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious DiseasesResolution No. 95 or the “Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for Covid-19 Vaccines” was approved.The memorandum was signed by National Task Force (NTF) against Covid-19 chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr., as well as Defense Secretary and NTF chairperson Delfin Lorenzana, and Interior Secretary and NTF vice chairman Eduardo Año.\n",
      "The memorandum ordered all agencies of NTF, its regional local Covid-19 task forces and all regional and local Covid-19 vaccination operations centers, local task forces and local Covid-19 vaccination operation centers to implement and adapt the vaccination plan.\n",
      "The country’s vaccination plan, which was released by the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), cited that P82.5 billion has been allocated for funding sources of the Covid-19 vaccine deployment program.\n",
      "Under the 118-page vaccine plan, all regional offices and local government units are enjoined to put up vaccination operations centers (VOC) as soon as possible.\n",
      "“The implementing units such as government hospitals (both private and public), private clinics, government agencies, rural health units) shall forward all concerns and reports to the City/Municipal Health Offices. The City/Municipal Health Offices, in turn, are required to report all concerns and updates to the VOC,” read the vaccine plan.\n",
      "“All reports and unsettled issues of a VOC shall be raised to the overseeing VOC. The overseeing VOC, on the other hand, shall provide feedback and provide recommendation to the reporting VOC,” it added.\n",
      "Masterlisting\n",
      "The vaccine deployment plan also includes masterlisting or the linelisting and registration of the population before the vaccination process.\n",
      "“This could be done through an online or offline platform developed by the DICT, and DOH’s KMITS and EB. From the masterlist, eligible populations for specific vaccines will be culled out and accessed by appropriate regions or LGU for registration, scheduling, mapping-out on appropriate vaccination sites and advisory,” read the Covid-19 vaccine plan.The LGUs are required to undergo profiling and screening of eligible target populations for the registration of mass immunization.\n",
      "The masterlisting are as follows:\n",
      "Group A includes frontline health workers, senior citizens, indigent population and uniformed personnel.\n",
      "Group B includes other frontline workers and special populations.Group C, meanwhile, is the remaining population.\n",
      "Consent for Covid-19 vaccine recipient\n",
      "The country’s mass inoculation plan also underscored informed consent for citizens who will get vaccinated. It said informed consent is “ethical and legal requirement.”\n",
      "Recipients must know the adverse effects as well as potential unknown risks of the Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“In the current situation, it will be important to make clear to potential recipients of a COVID-19 vaccine that the duration of immunity conferred is currently unknown and may not be equally effective across all age-groups. The benefits and risks that are disclosed will depend on what is known about them at the time consent is given,” read the vaccine deployment plan.\n",
      "Post evaluation on vaccines\n",
      "Also included in the vaccine plan are vaccine safety monitoring and management of adverse effects “after the first dose of vaccine was administered.”\n",
      "“The role of vaccine safety monitoring during COVID-19 vaccine introduction is to facilitate the early detection, reporting, notification, investigation and analysis, and feedback of Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFIs) and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI), to ensure appropriate and timely case management and response,” read the vaccine plan.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — While other countries have begun inoculating their citizens against the coronavirus disease, the people of the Philippines are still waiting at the sidelines for the first doses of the vaccine from various drug manufacturers to arrive.\n",
      "The government, through the Philippine Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has so far given its emergency use authorization (EUA) to three COVID-19 vaccine developers — the United States’ Pfizer-BioNTech, United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca-Oxford University, and most recently China’s Sinovac.The EUAs were granted to speed up the process of receiving doses of vaccines even as these medicines have not been globally approved for commercial use. In the local setting, the EUAs will help push forward the country’s inoculation drive, which has been held back by a series of delays and the limited supply of vaccines.\n",
      "Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., also the lead of the National Task Force against COVID-19, has been busy of late fending off brickbats for the delay in the arrival of the vaccines, on which hinged a number of things — jumpstarting the slumped economy, shift to the less restrictive modified general community quarantine,and the reopening of in-person school classes, to name a few.\n",
      "Amid all these, the country has yet to receive a single dose of vaccine, that even President Rodrigo Duterte has been said to have expressed his impatience over the delays.\n",
      "“More than 100,000 Pfizer/BioNTech doses have also been allotted to the Philippines through the COVAX initiative,” said Katharina Buchholz, a data journalist for Statista, analysis by market and data consumer company.\n",
      "“But these can only be delivered after the Philippines have enacted a framework for compensating those who might potentially suffer from side effects of the vaccine. The mandatory condition that will absolve Pfizer of direct responsibility highlights the bureaucratic hurdles of receiving some coronavirus vaccines,” she added.\n",
      "The Department of Health (DOH) Tuesday reported that the country has a total of 564,865 Covid-19 cases. Of the sum, 29,817 are active cases and 522,941 are recoveries. Around 12,107 individuals have succumbed to the disease.\n",
      "In numbers: Vaccination drive in other Asian nations\n",
      "Based on the Feb. 23 data compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, over 700 million vaccine doses have already been administered in Asia.\n",
      "https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations\n",
      "Data showed that Israel has been vaccinating its population faster than any countries in Asia and globally. As of February 20, 82.8 doses ofA vaccinated person refers to someone who has received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine while a fully vaccinated person has received the maximum required doses.\n",
      "Vaccination progress in Asia\n",
      "According to recent data by Statista, more than a dozen of countries in Asia had already started its vaccination drives during the past weeks.\n",
      "However, the firm noted that some countries are seeing a slowdown in administering vaccines to portions of its population. This includes China, which developed its own vaccines. The consumer company saidChina’s vaccination is currently atat a rate of 2-3 doses administered per 100 people.\n",
      "“[T]he campaigns are also still in the early stages,” Buchholz said.\n",
      "Covid-19 have been administered in the country for every 100 people.\n",
      "India, which started inoculating its people last month, also seemed to be at a slow pace when it comes to its vaccine rollout.\n",
      "“[I]ndia’s rollout has been somewhat slower at currently 0.8 doses administered per 100 people despite the fact that the country has also developed its own shot and is currently producing the University of Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine under the name Covishield. Some Indians have shunned the locally developed variety Covaxin since third stage trial results are still outstanding,” Buchholz added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the firm observed in its report that vaccine diplomacy, donation, and gifts from countries where the vaccines are developed helped several countries to to kickstart their inoculation drive.\n",
      "“The Seychelles have used China’s Sinopharm vaccine since January 11 and have now already given out 66 doses per 100 people, also using Covishield from India. The Maldives, which like the Seychelles received the Covishield vaccine as a gift, counted almost 14 doses per 100 people since starting the campaign on Feb 1, according to Our World in Data.”\n",
      "The donation effort of the locally produced University of Oxford vaccine is also benefiting Mauritius, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Myanmar, among others. China has also donated its vaccines to Cambodia, Laos and Pakistan, while Indonesia is a paying customer to the Chinese.”\n",
      "Acquired vaccines per country\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is coordinating with other government agencies like the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to prevent the entry of fake Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "This comes amid reports of a crackdown on vials of counterfeit coronavirus jabs from China.“Meron nang pakikipag-ugnayan ang FDA, ang ating Bureau of Customs na talagang susuriing maiigi itong mga dokumento ng mga bakunang darating, at magkakaroon pa po sila ng orientation patungkol dito,” said Secretary Francisco Duque III when asked if the Department of Health has already put in place measures to bar the entry and proliferation of bogus Covid-19 vaccines in the country.\n",
      "(There’s already coordination between our FDA and our Bureau of Customs to really scrutinize the documents of arriving vaccines and for them to have orientation regarding this matter.)\n",
      "“At ako naman ay nakakasiguro na itong mga pekeng bakuna na ito — ay harinawa ay ‘di makapasok at kung saka-sakali naman makapasok — ‘don pa lang sa border controls natin ay talagang mapigilan na at maimbestigahan at makasuhan ang mga salarin, so ‘yan po ang pinaghahandaan,” he added.\n",
      "(As for me, I’m assured that these fake vaccines — hopefully, won’t be able to infiltrate and if ever it does — we can intercept immediately at our border controls and investigate and prosecute perpetrators. That’s what’s being prepared for.)\n",
      "On Tuesday, China’s state news agency Xinhua said more than 80 people were arrested in different police operations conducted in Beijing, Shanghai, and the eastern province of Shandong where 3,000 doses of false vaccines were seized.\n",
      "Further reports have shown that the sinister scheme has been going on since September 2020.According to the news report, the fake vaccines only contained saline — a solution of water and salt.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — Some senators on Thursday have questioned why the Philippines seems to be lagging behind its vaccination program, saying that the delivery date of vaccines to the country remains unclear amid the absence of any signed supply agreement.\n",
      "“Nakakailang araw na tayong kaka-practice pero wala pa rin yung bakuna and they can’t give us a definite date when it is coming,” Senator Nancy Binay said in an interview with ABS-CBN News Channel.(We’ve already had days of practice but until now we don’t have the vaccines yet and they can’t give us a definite date when it is coming.)\n",
      "“The mere fact na we only have term sheets at the moment, wala pa tayong supply agreement na pinipirmahan, the delivery of the vaccine will always be a question. At this point ang sigurado lang ay hindi sigurado kung kailan dadating yung bakuna,” she said.\n",
      "(The mere fact that we only have term sheets at the moment and we have yet to sign any supply agreement,the delivery of the vaccines will always be a question. At this point the only thing that is sure is that it is still unsure when the vaccines will arrive.)\n",
      "The government targets to roll out its Covid-19 mass immunization program within the first quarter of the year, eyeing to vaccinate at least 70 million Filipinos to achieve herd immunity and significantly arrest the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, which causes the potentially fatal respiratory illness.\n",
      "“I think from day one when we had this problem, lagi tayong reactionary. Kumbaga at this point, hindi tayo makahabol do’n sa pag-solve natin sa problem natin sa Covid-19,” Binay also said.\n",
      "(I think from day one when we had this problem, we have always been reactionary. That’s why at this point, we can’t keep up in solving our problem with Covid-19.)\n",
      "Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon also lamented that the Philippines is being “left behind” in the procurement and administration of Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“It is very disappointing. I am worried for the future of our country,” he said in a statement.\n",
      "“Each day we fail to start the vaccination raises the risk of further spread of the virus and makes our economic recovery longer,” he added.Drilon pointed out that the Philippines is lagging behind its regional peers in the vaccination of its population.\n",
      "“Many are baffled by our situation. Out of the 10 countries in Southeast Asia, six have already started inoculating their citizens,” the minority leader said.\n",
      "Among the countries that have started rolling out jabs are Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar, leaving the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, and Thailand behind, according to Drilon.\n",
      "“Bakit tayo hanggang ngayon wala pa rin?” he asked.\n",
      "(Why is it that until now, we don’t have the vaccines yet.)\n",
      "The Philippines has already “locked-in” 108 million doses of vaccines through “term sheets” with different manufacturers.\n",
      "The government, meanwhile, will likely sign “a few” supply agreements by the end of February.\n",
      "“I cannot emphasize this enough: our survival as a nation largely depends on our ability to ensure immediate access and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines to our people. At the rate things are going, however, Filipinos have to wait longer,” Drilon went on.\n",
      "Aside from the lack of confidence by Filipinos in Covid-19 vaccines, the senator said politics also poses a challenge to the government’s mass vaccination program against coronavirus.\n",
      "“We must prevent the politicization of the Covid-19 vaccination. The Covid-19 vaccination program will not succeed if we inject politics,” Drilon said.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines still can’t make reservations for COVID-19 vaccines— not because it lacks funds but because other countries have already made their own reservations, President Rodrigo Duterte said in a pre-recorded address aired late on Tuesday.\n",
      "According to Duterte, the United States and some countries in Europe, where the pharmaceutical companies are based, have already made a down payment on the vaccines to reserve them for their own citizens.So funding is not a problem, he said, with Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez assuring him that the government would be able to secure another loan for $300 million.\n",
      "“As long as someone would lend us money, no problem about it,” he said, speaking partly in Filipino. “How long? In due time. It’s not that we don’t want to buy. There’s still nothing for us to buy.”\n",
      "“So you can expect that in the few months until next year, all of those vaccines produced will be used by the Americans. Same story with the European countries who have successfully developed a vaccine,” he added.\n",
      "And it’s the same situation with China, which Duterte said last April would prioritize the Philippines in the provision of vaccines.\n",
      "“Again, we have to keep in mind that they have a population to worry [about], and that population is not easy,” the President said.\n",
      "China would take care of its own citizens first before they give vaccines to others, he added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Duterte remained optimistic that the government could afford to shoulder the inoculation of the country’s poorest.\n",
      "Filipinos with more money, he pointed out, would be able to “buy the medicines for themselves.”\n",

Actual quantity and date of delivery will depend on several factors,” he said.\n",
      "“We’ll buy from others as well as opportunities arise. This is to augment what the DOH will give us,” the mayor added.\n",

      "The phase 1 of the vaccination program will benefit medical frontliners, while the phase 2 will be for senior citizens and persons with disabilities, according to a separate Facebook post from the Pasig City Public Information Office (PIO) on Monday.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — At least 5.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca are expected to arrive in the country within the first quarter of this year, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Sunday.\n",
      "Galvez said the Philippines stands to get a total of 9,407,400 doses from the two pharmaceutical firms within the first and second quarters of this year through the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility.The country will receive 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which will be delivered in mid-February, while 5,500,800 to 9,290,400 doses are expected from AstraZeneca, whose initial delivery is scheduled by mid to late February, according to the letter of COVAX facility to the Philippine government.\n",
      "“I would like to emphasize that according to COVAX the number of doses and the projected arrival of the vaccines are all indicative since it all depends on the global supply,” Galvez said in a statement.\n",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the Covid-19 vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca emergency use authorization.\n",
      "Galvez said many local government units (LGUs) and the private sector are ready for the vaccine roll-out: from their vaccination sites, to their cold storage equipment and facilities, to their personnel.\n",
      "“We were all clueless then on how to effectively manage and mitigate the impact of this infectious disease. But with the arrival of vaccines and the implementation of the National Action Plan Against COVID-19, we are now in a better position to put an end to the epidemic,” he said.\n",
      "Galvez earlier said the government aims to inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos using the 148 million doses of vaccines it expects to obtain from seven pharmaceutical firms.\n",
      "He urged Filipinos to “set their fears aside” and get vaccinated against Covid-19, assuring that the vaccines the government will administer passed the stringent selection and evaluation process of the vaccine experts panel, FDA, and the Department of Health.\n",
      "“We are confident that with the whole nation working together, we will be able to recover our economy and bring back a greater sense of normalcy among our people,” he said.\n",

      "However, some critics have been questioning the government’s supposed preference for vaccines from Sinovac, considering its higher price and lesser reported efficacy rate as compared to other vaccines.\n",
      "Reports state that the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech showed a general efficacy of less than 60 percent in its late-stage trial in Brazil.

      "MANILA, Philippines — Cabinet members have asked President Rodrigo Duterte to certify as urgent a bill seeking to establish an indemnity fund for those getting COVID-19 vaccines, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said on Monday.In the president’s pre-recorded briefing that aired late at night, Galvez, who heads the government‘s vaccination program, said the speed of the procurement was now in the hands of the Senate — particularly Senate President Vicente Sotto III and Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, chair of the Committee on Health and Demography.\n",
      "“That’s why we have a communication, Mr. President, that these bills should be certified as urgent. That’s our recommendation,” Galvez said in Filipino.\n",
      "Duterte responded by asking for the documents.\n",
      "Go, who was present during Duterte’s briefing, also said that the bill had already reached the committee level.\n",
      "“Secretary Galvez and I have talked so that you can certify it as urgent this week,” Go told Duterte.\n",
      "The bills will create clauses in agreements between the government and pharmaceutical companies that will indemnify vaccine recipients in case they experience adverse effects.\n",
      "Galvez said he had requested Sotto and Go to prioritize the indemnification clause, along with the approval of local government units of advance market commitment on the vaccines.\n",
      "Last Jan. 26, Sen. Nancy Binay filed Senate Bill No. 2015 seeking to put up the indemnification fund that will be subsidized by pharmaceutical companies supplying the government with vaccines.\n",
      "In turn, the government would craft a set of guidelines and an agreement, which would be required before it formally accepts the vaccines.Although the bill has not been approved, Galvez said immunization could start sometime late in February or in March — when the first batch of one to three million doses of vaccines are expected to arrive.\n",
      "According to Galvez, the documentation has been accomplished, and all that was needed was for an indemnification agreement to be signed with the pharmaceutical companies.\n",
      "He also assured that minor snags in the storage and rollout of the vaccines had been addressed, like having additional third-party storage facilities provided by local pharmaceutical companies, which can address the low-temperature requirement of the vaccines.\n",
      "The expenses for the third-party storage facilities would also be included in the loans that the government would acquire for the COVID-19 vaccine procurement.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — Wealthy nations have already bought up at least 80% of the future COVID-19 vaccines supply, the Philippines’ vaccine czar said Wednesday.\n",
      "COVID-19 policy chief implementer Carlito Galvez, Jr., who is also the designated vaccine czar, said developing countries like the Philippines are now scrambling for the remaining supply of the vaccines.“80% of the global market has been taken by the rich countries. Now we are fighting for the 18% because COVAX has gotten the other (2) percent,” Galvez said during the online Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum.\n",
      "He was referring to the COVAX Facility, a global mechanism designed to guarantee rapid, fair, and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines worldwide which the Philippines joined in July.\n",
      "The former military general explained that the deals were made possible by advance market commitments with pharmaceutical companies.\n",
      "“If we will not do the advance market commitment, we will be at the tail end of the supply chain,” he said.\n",
      "The Philippine government and private companies signed a supply agreement with British drugmaker AstraZeneca involving at least two million doses of its vaccine last week.\n",
      "This is after President Rodrigo Duterte finally agreed to make advance commitments and advance payments to private vaccine developers to ensure supply for the Philippines despite expressing reservations in September due to the country’s procurement laws.\n",
      "Galvez said the government is currently in negotiations with other big pharmaceutical companies for potential vaccine deals.\n",
      "Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also looking into the vaccines of China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and Pfizer of the United States.\n",

      "“The evaluation is going to take about two weeks, so it was given to us right before Christmas. So I’m giving the evaluators up to the first week of January and of course, I have to consolidate the report,” he added.Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo. (Consuelo Marquez / INQUIRER.net)“An EUA is not a one-letter certificate. It’s going to be a big document that will specify all of the conditions for authorization.”Pfizer submitted its application for EUA in the Philippines last Dec. 23, Malacañang previously announced.The EUA is seen to shorten the FDA’s process of approving COVID-19 vaccines from six months to just 21 days. The FDA’s issuance of an EUA also means that the agency recognizes the vaccines’ approval by regulatory bodies overseas.Pfizer has already secured an EUA from the United States’ FDA. gsg\n",

      "“Here, it may cost $38.50 (P1,847.25) per dose but is co­vered by a confidentiality disclosure agreement,” he added.\n",
      "Lacson cited a report in the Bangkok Post on Saturday saying the price of CoronaVac in Thailand was $5 per dose, based on figures from the World Health Organization and from the manufacturer. But a report in India Today on Tuesday said the price of CoronaVac in India was $14, or about P673, per dose.\n",
      "Vice President Leni Robredo, speaking in her radio show on Sunday, also pointed out the varying prices of CoronaVac, citing a statement of Dr. Tony Leachon, a former adviser to the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, that the price of the China-made vaccine, as reported by a Thai newspaper, was $5 in Thailand and $17 (P817) in Indonesia.\n",
      "Robredo asked the Department of Health (DOH) for an explanation.\n",
      "During budget deliberations in November, the DOH told the Senate committee on finance that the price of the Sinovac vaccine was P3,629.50 for the two-dose regimen.\n",
      "The head of the government’s vaccine program, Carlito Galvez Jr., later disputed reports about CoronaVac’s pricing, claiming it was actually lower than the prices of other brands and was in the middle among seven drug manufacturers being eyed by the Philippine government as sources of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Galvez, however, refused to disclose how much Sinovac had offered the government, citing confidentiality agreements.\n",
      "‘Fake news’\n",
      "In a radio interview on Sunday, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said that while officials were still not allowed to disclose how much the Sinovac vaccine would cost the government, he could say that it would be around P650—closer to the price in Indonesia.Roque called reports that the Sinovac shot cost over P3,600 “fake news.”\n",
      "“China’s prices are not like capitalist companies that are market-dictated. They can adjust their prices accordingly, depending on who is buying,” he said. “That’s why Beijing doesn’t want to announce its prices, because other countries that are not as close to them would find out they might have bought at a more expensive price.”\n",
      "In a subsequent tweet on Sunday afternoon, Lacson took note of the Malacañang statement, saying: “If it’s true that [the] government is now dropping the price of [the] Sinovac vaccine from P1,847.25 per dose to only P650, the Senate has probably done our share to save our people billions of pesos in the country’s vaccination program.”\n",
      "Netizens, too, “can pat themselves on the back” for their outcry, he added.\n",
      "A senior lawmaker, who asked not to be identified for lack of authority to discuss confidential negotiations, told the Inquirer that the cost of the vaccine could be lowered for governments on two conditions: if the country agrees to clinical trials, and if the country has the capacity to manufacture the vaccine locally.\n",
      "Preference for Sinovac\n",
      "During the Senate committee of the whole’s inquiry on the vaccination program last week, Lacson also noted that implementers of the vaccine program “apparently showed preference” for the CoronaVac maker, “which may fuel speculations that corruption is involved in the government’s dealings with Sinovac.”\n",
      "“Sinovac has a track record of bribery, yet why insist on dealing with them?” he said in a radio interview on Saturday.\n",
      "“Considering all these, can we blame the lawmakers and even our countrymen why they express suspicion in the government’s vaccination program?” he added.\n",
      "Last week, Sinovac applied with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its vaccine in the Philippines, but the regulator said the company submitted incomplete papers. Lacking were the results of Phase 3 clinical trials, the FDA said.\n",
      "On Saturday, China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced during a meeting with President Duterte in Malacañang that China would donate 500,000 doses of CoronaVac, but Sen. Francis Pangilinan said on Sunday that the donation should not influence the FDA into hastily approving the Sinovac vaccine.\n",
      "“Science and the data and results of clinical trials should be the sole basis and not political goodwill,” Pangilinan said in a post on Twitter.\n",
      "Critics have slammed the government’s plan to buy 25 million doses of CoronaVac, pointing out its steep price and poor showing in clinical trials.\n",
      "The latest disappointing report about CoronaVac came from Brazil last week, with researchers returning a finding that the vaccine was only 50.4 percent effective, barely enough to gain regulatory approval.\n",
      "Not done deal\n",
      "At the close of the Senate inquiry on Friday, Galvez said the government had not yet paid for the 25 million doses and had only secured an advance market commitment from Sinovac to “lock in” a certain number of doses for the Philippines.\n",
      "“So it’s not a done deal?” Sen. Nancy Binay asked.\n",
      "“No,” Galvez replied. —WITH A REPORT FROM KRIXIA SUBINGSUBING INQ\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The Manila Health Department (MHD) is eyeing to finish its vaccination drive against measles and rubella (German measles) before the arrival of the Covid-19 vaccines in the country.\n",
      "Manila City health officer Dr. Arnold Pangan said Thursday that the local measles vaccination drive should be completed before the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines, so that health personnel of the local government unit can fully focus on vaccination activities against the new coronavirus.So far, 38,603 children aged nine to 59 months (four years and nine months) in the city have already been vaccinated against measles and rubella since the inoculation program started last Monday.\n",
      "The figure represents 27.10 percent of the MHD’s target, according to Pangan.\n",
      "He said the city government aims to vaccinate about 146,000 children by mid-February.\n",
      "“If we can do it in two weeks time, mas maganda po kasi baka dumating na ’yung COVID-19 vaccine. Baka magdodoble-doble pa po ‘yung trabaho nila (health workers), so pinipilit natin na bilisan pa para po mas ma-achive natin ‘yung goal natin the soonest possible time,” Dr. Pangan said in a statement.\n",
      "(If we can do it in two weeks time, that would be better because Covid-19 vaccines may already arrive, and then the work of our health workers may become doubly hard. That’s why we want to expedite the vaccination so that we can achieve our goal at the soonest possible time.)\n",
      "The vaccination program against measles is being implemented nationwide through coordination between the Department of Health, World Health Organization, United Nations Children’s Fund, RELIEF International, Healthy Philippines, and local government units across the country.\n",

      "As Asia transitions to a “Goldilocks” phase of economic recovery in 2021, the Philippines is seen by global financial services giant Morgan Stanley among the countries that will benefit the most from the availability of COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "Across the region, “this Goldilocks phase should see accelerating and above-trend year-on-year growth, rising but still benign inflation, and ‘big easy’ policies,” Morgan Stanley Research said in a Nov. 3 report titled “Goldilocks and the Three Bears.”“In particular, we believe that India, Indonesia and the Philippines look better placed in this Goldilocks environment, as they stand to benefit more from early vaccine availability and the Fed’s AIT framework,” Morgan Stanley added, referring to the US Federal Reserve’s new average inflation targeting which started this year.\n",
      "“Even though daily COVID-19 cases have also come off earlier highs in India, Indonesia and the Philippines, these economies are likely trailing their Asian counterparts when it comes to COVID-19 containment. We think they could benefit disproportionately from vaccine availability, which could come as soon as later this year and/or early next year,” Morgan Stanley said.\n",
      "In the case of the Philippines, Morgan Stanley noted that the government had already been in discussions with a number of possible vaccine sources such as China, Russia and the World Health Organization, as well as giant US drug firms like Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc.\n",
      "“The government is also planning to hold talks with Australian biotech firm CSL Ltd. and partner University of Queensland, as it looks to diversify possible vaccine sources. While policymakers acknowledged that the Philippines does not have its own vaccine manufacturing capacity, it has sought to join clinical trials for vaccines,” Morgan Stanley said.\n",
      "Also, the Philippines, India and Indonesia enjoy relatively lower debt-to-gross domestic product ratios compared to their neighbors, making them better positioned for an economic rebound in the medium term.\n",
      "“We still believe that those with better balance sheets, better demographic trends and institutional ability to push through structural reforms to offset headwinds from deglobalization are likely to fare better. All things considered, we think India, Indonesia and the Philippines look better placed,” Morgan Stanley said.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — COVID-19 policy chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. believes that the Philippines is not yet late in securing coronavirus vaccines supply although he admitted there are hindrances in the country’s procurement of the much-needed vaccines.\n",
      "“I believe we are not late yet because we have ongoing negotiations with different leading (pharmaceutical) companies,” Galvez said during the weekly Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum on Wednesday.The former military explained that President Rodrigo Duterte’s clearance was needed to ensure that the government could make necessary advance payments and commitments on vaccine deals which is strictly prohibited by the country’s auditing laws.\n",
      "Duterte has agreed to make advance market commitments and advance payments to private COVID-19 developers to ensure supply for the Philippines despite expressing reservations in September.\n",
      "The Philippine government and private companies signed a supply agreement with British drugmaker AstraZeneca involving at least two million doses of its vaccine last week.\n",
      "But Galvez expressed confidence that the country can achieve at least 50 million doses of vaccines by 2021.\n",
      "The Philippines aims to vaccinate up to 60 percent of the population against COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity.\n",
      "Aside from AstraZeneca, the government is also looking into the vaccines of China’s Sinovac Biotech, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, and Pfizer of the United States.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The government hopes to vaccinate for the new coronavirus 60 to 70 percent of all Filipinos — enough to trigger herd immunity — within three to five years, the chief of the COVID-19 task force said on Wednesday.\n",
      "Speaking at a news briefing, Undersecretary Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government could only vaccinate 20 million to 30 million people a year, and he estimated that P73 billion would be initially spent for the effort, not only to buy the required two doses for each citizen but also to cover “ancillary costs,” such as syringes and mobilization.Galvez, chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19, said the sources of the P73 billion—loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank—might be “unlocked” by December.\n",
      "“So rest assured that the funds to be used will be prepared this coming December,” he said, adding that as the task force was considering various options in placing advance orders for vaccines, it was actually preparing to spend P70 billion to P150 billion.\n",
      "Priority recipients\n",
      "He said the Department of Health (DOH) had given the task force a list of 35 million Filipinos who would be the priority recipients of the chosen vaccine.\n",
      "Those people, he said, include health-care workers, police and military personnel and other servicemen, essential workers from the social welfare and education departments and other government agencies, the elderly and the poor.\n",
      "The task force plans to make the distribution of vaccines geographical, Galvez said, adding that the worst-hit areas—Metro Manila, Calabarzon and Central Luzon, and the cities of Cebu, Davao and Cagayan de Oro—will get priority so that “we can immediately feel the [vaccines’] effect, and if this happens life will return to normal in these centers of the economy.”\n",
      "Galvez said the mass vaccinations could start in the second quarter or middle of 2021 at the earliest, which he described as the “best-case scenario.” At the latest, which he called the “worst-case scenario” but also the “realistic scenario,” it could start at the end of 2021 or early 2022.\n",
      "The government is negotiating with foreign governments and vaccine makers for vaccine supplies, Galvez said.\n",
      "He said Philippine officials were talking not only with the governments of Russia, China, United States and United Kingdom but also with the governments of Australia and India for vaccine supplies.\n",
      "“[For our plan to] vaccinate 60 million Filipinos, we are getting the portfolio of access to different vaccine producers [in] the countries where the vaccines will come from, and we have at least five to six where the vaccines can be sourced,” Galvez said.No storage problem\n",
      "Galvez gave assurance that storing the vaccines would not be a problem, given that the task force had six months to plan the logistics.\n",
      "For vaccines that need to be stored in near-zero or freezing-point temperatures, Philippine hospitals will be able to manage, he said. For vaccines that require storage in negative 20 to negative 80 degrees Celsius, the task force will negotiate with consortiums that can provide the storage units, he said.\n",
      "Whatever vaccine would be chosen by the Philippines would need approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Galvez said.\n",
      "The government’s vaccine expert panel will now start evaluating AstraZeneca’s application to hold clinical trials in the Philippines of its candidate vaccine, which has been found to be on average 70 percent effective against the coronavirus.\n",
      "Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Wednesday that the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company completed documentary requirements last week, clearing the way for the start of the regulatory process for its clinical trial. She, however, did not say when AstraZeneca will start the trial.\n",
      "Five pharmaceutical companies are applying to test their candidate vaccines on Filipinos.\n",
      "Apart from AstraZeneca, the companies are China’s Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals, Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute and the United States’ Johnson&Johnson.\n",
      "Only Sinovac has reached the more advanced stage of the regulatory process as it awaits the ethics board’s approval of its clinical trial.\n",
      "Locally tried vaccine\n",
      "Earlier, Vergeire said the government preferred buying a vaccine developed by a company that had tried the drug in the country. She explained that because vaccines work differently across ethnicities, testing a vaccine on Filipinos gives the government the opportunity to see how the candidate vaccine may affect the population.\n",
      "Initial results on the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University showed 90 percent efficacy among patients who received half a dose of the vaccine, followed by a full dose at least a month apart.\n",
      "For those who received two full doses of the vaccine at least a month apart, efficacy was 62 percent, resulting in an average efficacy of 70 percent.\n",
      "While the vaccine breached the World Health Organization’s benchmark efficacy of 50 percent, the UN body said more data on its safety and efficacy were needed since the initial results were based on only more than 11,000 participants from the United Kingdom and Brazil.\n",
      "In a statement, AstraZeneca said it expected to enroll up to 60,000 participants in its large-scale Phase 3 trials. The planned trial in the Philippines and other Asian and European countries will complement the ones being conducted in the United States, Japan, Russia, South Africa, Kenya and Latin America.\n",
      "Although the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine will be sold at cost and is logistically compatible with the Philippines, Vergeire said it was still too early to say that this was the most practical and ideal vaccine for the country.\n",
      "“We still need to see the technical details of the vaccine. Everything has to be taken into this complete context wherein we study everything — specific and very critical is to see the performance of this vaccine, based on the evaluation of our experts,” she said.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines is negotiating with seven vaccine manufacturers to procure at least 148 million doses as it seeks to inoculate close to two-thirds of its population this year, according to the head of the country’s national vaccination program and chief implementer of the National Task Force Against COVID-19.\n",
      "Speaking at the Laging Handa briefing on Wednesday, Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government was hoping to close deals with Novavax, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson of the United States, United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca, China’s Sinovac Biotech and Russia’s Gamaleya Institute.“Based on our current negotiations, we will be able to purchase at least 148 million doses from more or less seven manufacturers. However, it will be dependent on the global supply,” he said.\n",
      "“The government will have a portfolio of vaccines,” he said. “This means we will get vaccines from different manufactures. This is to ensure that we we will have vaccines for everyone, particularly this year 2021.”\n",
      "Full subsidy\n",
      "Galvez said the Philippines also would receive fully subsidized doses for around 23 million Filipinos through the Covax Facility, which is aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide equitable access to all countries to safe and effective vaccines, once these are licensed and approved.\n",
      "Covax is led jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Oslo-based Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the Geneva-based Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\n",
      "Galvez said the Philippines and Colombia would be the first two countries to take part in the solidarity trial of the WHO for COVID-19 vaccine candidates set also for this month.\n",
      "He said as many as 15,000 volunteers from Metro Manila would participate in the clinical trial, which would be implemented by the Department of Science and Technology and the Philippine General Hospital.\n",
      "“This is so that we can have a full evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the candidate vaccine,” he said.\n",
      "The former military chief of staff did not disclose the candidate vaccines that would be used in the trial.\n",
      "The Philippines had earlier targeted 80 million doses and though it has been talking with vaccine-makers for months, the country had secured only 2.6 million, from AstraZeneca, paid for by a private sector group, which will give half of the shots to their employees.Priority recipients\n",
      "On Wednesday, AstraZeneca applied for an emergency use authorization for its vaccine in the Philippines.\n",
      "Galvez said the priority recipients of the vaccines have already been designated—health-care workers, vulnerable indigent senior citizens, [residents of] poor communities, uniformed personnel, teachers and school workers, government workers, overseas Filipino workers and other essential workers.\n",
      "A “whole-of-nation” approach will also be undertaken to involve local governments and the private sector in the vaccination program.\n",
      "He said the local governments would help in identifying the priority vaccine recipients, while the private sector would provide technical and financial support for storage and deployment.\n",
      "Even though the government- provided vaccines are going to be free, people will have to volunteer to be inoculated and local governments have to convince their constituents to have themselves inoculated.\n",
      "Trust level\n",
      "In San Juan City, Mayor Francis Zamora said the important thing was to “increase the trust level” of residents on vaccines.\n",
      "“Right now, we understand that there is still some skepticism surrounding COVID-19 vaccines because these are newly developed,” he said.\n",
      "At least 4,109 of an estimated 122,000 San Juan residents had signed up for vaccination as of Tuesday afternoon, just a day after the city government announced opened the registration.\n",
      "Zamora was hopeful that more of his constituents would sign up for an orderly and fast roll out of vaccines, and that the city would be able to ease the vaccination process as early as April.\n",
      "He said the city would prioritize the inoculation of health workers and front-liners to be vaccinated first, followed by indigent senior citizens and other residents who registered.\n",
      "The city council last year passed Ordinance No. 75 allocating P50 million for vaccine procurement.\n",
      "According to Zamora, the money was “more than enough” because the national government would also be giving funds to local governments for their vaccine needs.\n",
      "He said he preferred a vaccine with a high efficacy rate, made by a company that had a “good reputation” and met the standards set by local and international agencies.\n",

It’s so easy,” Durante admitted in an interview on ANC’s “Headstart.”Asked if Durante himself inoculated the vaccine to the PSG officials, he said: “As I’ve said, we vaccinated ourselves. It is within our command.” “We’ve done our research. For now, we’ve found the appropriate vaccine for us, which I could say is a traditional vaccine, so we took the risk,” he said. Interior and Local Government Secretary Eduardo Año earlier confirmed that a Cabinet member and a number of PSG members have received the COVID-19 vaccine.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), however,said that no vaccine has been approved yet for official use, adding that it is illegal to import, distribute and for a doctor or medical practitioner to administer unregistered drugs in the country.gsgFor more news about the novel coronavirus click here.\n",

      "Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said that the country would receive at least two COVID-19 vaccines as early as February.Senator Panfilo Lacson then asked Galvez, during the hearing of the Senate Committee of the Whole, when the first COVID-19 vaccination would happen.\n",
      "Galvez initially said it would be on February 20 but later clarified he was referring to the expected delivery of the vaccines.\n",
      "“Ang tanong ko nga, kailan ‘yung unang bakuna? (My question is, when is the first vaccination?)” Lacson asked.\n",
      "“…Para naman umasa ‘yung mga kababayan natin na sa February 28 or sa March 1 mababakunahan sila, pwede bang i-share mo lang sa amin kailan yung unang bakuna sa tantya mo?” he further asked.\n",
      "(So that our countrymen can have hope that they could be vaccinated by February 28 or March 1, can you share with us when you think the first vaccination will be administered?)\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — Without a vaccine yet to prevent COVID-19’s spread, President Duterte’s economic managers have tempered growth expectations for next year despite recovery from this year’s recession.\n",
      "The Cabinet-level Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) last July 28 approved via ad referendum their projection that real gross domestic product (GDP) will contract between 4.4 percent and 6.6 percent — or an average of 5.5 percent — this year.In the first half, the economy shrank by an average of 9 percent as second-quarter GDP fell by a record 16.5 percent year-on-year and brought about a technical recession.\n",
      "For 2021, GDP was projected to rebound by growing 6.5-7.5 percent, although slower than the DBCC’s estimate last May of a stronger 8-9 percent economic expansion.\n",
      "Acting Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Karl Kendrick T. Chua, the country’s chief economist, explained to the Inquirer that the slower growth range projection for next year was approved “to adjust to the emerging consensus that the virus will stay longer and the vaccine longer to develop.”\n",
      "“The pandemic is assumed to last longer than we earlier thought — not until September only; could extend to the end of 2020 when vaccines are thought to become available,” Department of Finance (DOF) Undersecretary and chief economist Gil S. Beltran told the Inquirer separately.\n",
      "“Recession in 2020 is deeper so that recovery would take longer,” Beltran added.\n",
      "Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III during Security Bank’s online economic forum last Thursday expressed optimism that a vaccine “can bring a definitive end to this crisis.”\n",
      "“Countries that are leading in the funding and development of these potential vaccines have committed to give the Philippines priority in purchasing doses once these are approved,” Dominguez said.\n",
      "“The government, for its part, has adequate funds to purchase the vaccines. But for now, since we don’t have the vaccine yet, we treat infections and find ways to co-exist with the virus,” Dominguez added.\n",
      "Last week, Dominguez said the government can afford to purchase COVID-19 vaccines and provide them for free to the poor through loans to be extended by two well-capitalized state-run banks.Dominguez had explained that their plan was for state-run Philippine International Trading Corp. (PITC) to purchase the COVID-19 vaccines to be approved by the DOH’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA), through a term loan from the Land Bank of the Philippines (Landbank) and the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP).\n",
      "“PITC will sell the vaccines to the DOH. The DOH will pay PITC over time from their future allocations from the national budget,” Dominguez had said.\n",
      "Referring to Landbank and DBP, Dominguez had said that “the current balance sheets of both GFIs [government financial institutions] can support the estimated loan requirement of P20 billion.”\n",
      "“Please recall that since 2016, by hardly collecting any dividends from Landbank and DBP, the national government, in effect, strengthened their capital bases. This, in turn, was made possible by the tax and administrative reforms that increased government revenues,” Dominguez had noted.\n",
      "The two lenders’ cash dividends—mandated among government-owned and/or -controlled corporations (GOCCs) to be remitted to the national treasury—were being waived in recent years and instead used to recapitalize themselves.\n",
      "As for those who could afford themselves a vaccine, Dominguez had said Landbank and DBP can also “fund loans to qualified borrowers who wish to supply FDA-approved vaccines on a commercial basis.”\n",
      "Separately, Landbank president and chief executive Cecilia C. Borromeo told the Inquirer last week that the lender “may extend a credit facility for PITC for the purchase of necessary vaccines on behalf of the DOH, similar to what Landbank did when the national government launched the generic medicine program years ago.”\n",
      "“The amount for the trade transaction credit facility will be based on the requirement of PITC, and the sharing between Landbank and DBP will logically be based on the size of the balance sheets of the GFIs and the preference of the DOF,” according to Borromeo, whose Landbank is bigger than DBP.\n",

      "While multilateral lenders have committed to jack up loan financing so the Philippines can buy COVID-19 vaccines, the government’s procurement has been the slowest in the region so far such that economists worry that an economic rebound would also lag.\n",
      "The latest World Bank documents showed the Washington-based lender’s upcoming additional financing for the Philippines’ COVID-19 Emergency Response Project to be implemented by the Department of Health was raised to $400 million as of Jan. 16 from $300 million previously.As such, the total commitment across 14 loans in the World Bank’s near-term lending pipeline for the Philippines rose to $2.9 billion.\n",
      "Besides the World Bank loan for vaccine procurement and distribution, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank has also committed $325 million under its Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility while the Beijing-based Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank is reviewing financing requests from member-countries, including the Philippines.\n",
      "Despite a flurry of available financing, Citigroup managing director and head of Asia-Pacific economic and market analysis Johanna Chua told a webinar organized by debt watcher Fitch Ratings on Tuesday that the Philippines was a laggard in the region in purchasing COVID-19 vaccines.\n",
      "“When it comes to vaccine procurement and we kind of track the supply, I think the Philippines is actually the one with the least procurement. In Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), Singapore seems to be a little bit ahead, and then Thailand’s a little bit more than Malaysia [which was] sort of in the middle, and the Philippines\n",
      "a little bit lagging,” Chua said.In a report, London-based Capital Economics said that while “a vaccine should eventually prove a game-changer for the economy,” the Philippines has so far “only secured a small number of doses and faces many logistical challenges to achieving widespread vaccination.”\n",
      "For Chua, a revert to pre-pandemic gross domestic product (GDP) levels “may take longer” in the Philippines or up to 2022 even as other Asian countries, which also suffered from huge numbers of infections like India and Indonesia, could bounce back sooner.\n",
      "Chua said it did not help that the Philippines has been under prolonged quarantine such that mobility restrictions badly hit the services sector and its workers—among the bigger contributors to the domestic economy\n",
      "Chua was also worried that the Philippines’ private-sector investment boom pre-pandemic might not return as fast as it could post-pandemic.\n",
      "“Even though the fiscal balance sheet is very strong so the government can come in to provide some support and that could help drive the infrastructure, I worry that the lag, the overhang on private-sector capex is going to take a lot longer to unwind going into post-rebound” from the pandemic-induced recession, Chua said.According to Capital Economics, “the economic scars from the downturn, including business insolvencies, weaker household balance sheets and high unemployment, will weigh heavily on demand” this year such that consumer spending, which accounted for about 70 percent of the Philippines’ GDP, was “set to remain in the doldrums.”\n",
      "“While new infections are past their peak, they remain high and social distancing is likely to remain a drag on the economy throughout 2021,” Capital Economics said.\n",
      "For Capital Economics, the Philippines’ “failure to contain the virus and lackluster fiscal support means it will experience one of the slowest recoveries” in the Asia-Pacific region.\n",
      "“The economy has been slow to rebound so far. We estimate the GDP is still 8-percent below its pre-crisis level and even by the end of 2022 output is still likely to be 7.5-percent below the level it would have been had the crisis not happened,” Capital Economics added. INQ\n",

      "Health Sec. Francisco Duque III. (Voltaire F. Domingo/Senate PRIB)\n",
      "MANILA, Philippines — Health Secretary Francisco Duque III will not be inoculated with the CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’sSinovac, according to the Department of Health (DOH).“FTD (Francisco T. Duque) will not be vaccinated with SINOVAC as EUA (emergency use authorization) provisions exclude 60 and above. He also underscores that we will follow the prioritization framework, and will ensure that limited doses will go to the HCWs (healthcare workers) first,” the DOH told reporters in a Viber message on Sunday night.Duque, 64, earlier said he is willing to receive the CoronaVac, but added that the age restriction recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the vaccines from the Chinese firm may be an issue. On Sunday, Senator Christopher “Bong” Go also said that Duque and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. will be vaccinated on Monday morning with the Covid-19 vaccine from Sinovac. FDA Director-General Eric Domingo earlier said that the CoronaVac, despite getting a local EUA, should only be administered to clinically healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 years old, as the vaccine showed higher efficacy rates in this age group.He said that the vaccine showed a higher efficacy rate of 65.3 percent among clinically healthy people within this age bracket based on clinical trials in Indonesia, and 91.2 percent based on clinical trials in Turkey. The donated 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine from China arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, with the doses transported to the Philippine General Hospital, Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center early Monday morning.\n",

Everything’s falling back into place,” Locsin tweeted.\n",
      "“We will have complete range of vaccines from least effective to most available for everyone to choose from,” he added.\n",
      "Locsin added that a COVID-19 vaccine will not be “mass deployed” unless the “official recommending it for mass deployment is seen taking it himself.”\n",

      "“The State Councilor informed the Secretary of China’s intention to donate 500,000 doses of vaccines to the Philippines, in keeping with President Xi’s commitment to President Duterte,” read the statement from the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA).However, a DFA official said Chinese government will choose the pharmaceutical firm for the donated vaccines.\n",
      "“Since it is a donation, it will be up to the donor normally to determine which companies the vaccine will come from, but China has said it will take into consideration our side’s needs,” Foreign Affairs executive director for strategic communications Ivy Banzon-Abalos said in a message to reporters, when asked which vaccine will be donated from China.\n",
      "So far, the Philippines made an agreement with China’s pharmaceutical firm, Sinovac. The vaccines from Sinovac are expected to arrive by February.\n",
      "Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinopharm, however, has yet to give its decision on conducting vaccine trials in the Philippines.\n",
      "Aside from the vaccine donation, the two countries also signed the Philippines-China Agreement on Economic and Technical Cooperation, which has 500 million in Chinese currency renminbi worth of grant.\n",
      "“The agreement makes available a grant of 500 million RMB to finance livelihood projects, infrastructure facilities, feasibility studies for major projects and other mutually agreed projects,” said DFA.\n",

      "The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will lend the Philippines a combined $700 million (about P33.9 billion) by March to buy vaccines and inoculate Filipinos against the COVID-19 disease.\n",
      "Documents of the Beijing-based AIIB showed that it plans to shell out $300 million on top of the Manila-based ADB’s commitment of $400 million for their co-financing of the Second Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit COVID-19 or “HEAL 2” Project.With a total project cost of $764.17 million (about P37 billion), the government will shoulder the balance that the forthcoming ADB and AIIB loans will not cover.\n",
      "The AIIB said its share coming from the COVID-19 Crisis Recovery Facility it established last year to fight the pandemic would help the Philippine government undertake “rapid procurement of eligible COVID-19 vaccines.”\n",
      "Since the project will be co-financed with the ADB, the vaccines must be eligible under the regional program called Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility.\n",
      "Low-interest loans\n",
      "Last year, the AIIB and the ADB also jointly financed the Philippines’ pandemic response under the COVID-19 Active Response and Expenditure Support (CARES) Program, chipping in $750 million and $1.5 billion, respectively.\n",
      "Together with the incoming World Bank loan amounting to $500 million, the three multilateral lenders will inject a total of $1.2 billion into the Philippines COVID-19 vaccination program.\n",
      "Since the P70 billion in unprogrammed appropriations in the 2021 national budget that had been set aside for mass vaccination would mostly come from foreign borrowings, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III told President Duterte last month that the Philippines would tap up to $1.3 billion in low-interest loans from the ADB, the AIIB as well as the Washington-based World Bank.\n",
      "Last year, the Philippines secured $15.44 billion in foreign loans and grants to beef up its war chest against the health and socioeconomic crises inflicted by COVID-19.\n",
      "While borrowings surged, the Philippines will settle a record P1.79 trillion in debt this year, a sizable portion of the P4.51-trillion budget.\n",

      "PGH nurse Chareluck Santos administered the vaccine to Legaspi.\n",
      "Other government officials who were also inoculated with Sinovac’s vaccine, CoronaVac, include Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Benhur Abalos, and National Task Force against Covid-19 deputy implementer Vince Dizon.\n",
      "In a briefing, Legaspi noted that his decision to get the vaccines was based on “nothing else but science.”\n",
      "“Nakadesisyon po tayo sa Sinovac base sa siyensya. Sinabi ko po sa town hall, alisin natin ang ating view sa vaccine, hiwalay sa pulitika, hiwala sa partido, hiwalay sa administrasyon, hiwalay sa paniniwala kundi batay sa siyensya na malinaw,” Legaspi said, recalling a town hall meeting attended by PGH’s health workers.\n",
      "(We decided on Sinovac based on science. I told the town hall meeting, let’s remove our view on the vaccine, separate from politics, party, administration, whatever belief. Let’s base it on science that is clear.)\n",
      "Legaspi expressed confidence that FDA’s Domingo and the vaccine expert panel will not approve a vaccine that is not safe.\n",
      "“Hindi po ganon kaganda sa pananaw ng karamihan pero kapag sinuri ninyo nang mas malalim, maiintindihan po ninyo bakit ako ang una nag-volunteer magpabakuna,” Legaspi said.\n",
      "(It may not be good in a lot of people’s opinion but if you examine it deeper, you will understand why I volunteered to be first to get vaccinated.)“Katulad po ng sinabi ko, ang akin pong pananaw ay hango sa aking paniniwala sa datos at walang ibang basehan po,” he went on.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Labor and Employment’s (DOLE) offer to deploy more Filipino nurses and other health care workers to the United Kingdom and Germany in exchange for Covid-19 vaccines is “not a good recommendation,” Quezon 4th District Rep. Helen Tan said Wednesday.\n",
      "Tan, who chairs the House committee on health, opposed DOLE’s offer as she underscored the need for healthcare workers in the Philippines.“No, I hope DOLE is aware that we are in great need of more health care workers [especially] nurses in the different levels of health care facilities. This will mean widening the gaps on health care services,” Tan said in a text message when asked about the offer.\n",
      "“Although we cannot prevent nurses from leaving the country [because] of better opportunities abroad, still the idea of exchanging them to Covid vaccines is not a good recommendation,” she added.\n",
      "Tan said the government “can find other ways to have access to Covid vaccines.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, Bayan Muna Rep. Ferdinand Gaite said the offer to trade Filipino nurses for vaccines “exposes further the utter desperation of the Duterte government in procuring vaccines.”\n",
      "“It’s a shame that we’ve reached this point that we are ‘commodifying’ our nurses just to get our supply of vaccines. Mga nurse natin ngayon ang magiging kabayaran sa kapalpakan ng pamahalaang ito,” Gaite said in a statement.\n",
      "Gaite said the nurses are “being held hostage so they can be used as a bargaining chip.”\n",
      "“Instead of seeing them like trading goods, let’s treat them as workers with dignity and heed their demands for regular jobs, appropriate compensation, and safe working conditions,” Gaite said.\n",
      "Gabriela Partylist Rep. Arlene Brosas, meanwhile, said the offer was a “desperate attempt to patch up its incompetence in securing vaccines for the Filipino people, including overseas Filipino workers.”\n",
      "“We should not even have to negotiate this way in the bid to acquire COVID-19 vaccines. Bakit kailangang i-barter ang mas malaking nurse deployment para sa bakuna sa ating mga OFWs?” Brosas said.(Why do we have to barter for more nurse deployment for the vaccines of our OFWs?)\n",
      "DOLE earlier requested the UK and Germany to provide the Philippines with Covid-19 vaccines in exchange for exemption from the 5,000 per year limit on deployment of Filipino nurses and other health care workers.\n",
      "International Labor Affairs Bureau Director Alice Visperas said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III has spoken with the UK ambassador to the Philippines regarding the deal.\n",
      "Visperas said that if the UK and Germany would grant the request of DOLE, the vaccines would go to OFWs who were already repatriated and those who are departing for jobs abroad.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — Russia expressed readiness to supply the Philippines with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines, its envoy in Manila said Friday, adding that results of the trials are turning out “very promising.”\n",
      "“The Russian side is ready to closely cooperate with the Philippine partners in this field,” Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev told reporters in an online press briefing.According to the ambassador, proposals for the clinical trials as well as the production of the vaccine in the Philippines have already been submitted to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) and [are] now “under consideration.”\n",
      "“We have three options for cooperations. First, clinical trials, if our Philippine partners consider it necessary. The second option: We are ready to supply the vaccine to the Philippines. The third option is local production of vaccines here on Philippine soil,” Khovaev said.\n",
      "“It means that we are ready to combine our efforts, we are ready to make necessary investments together with our Philippine partners and we are ready to share our technologies simply because we want to build a robust partnership between our two nations,” he added.\n",
      "Russia is now only waiting for an official from the Philippine government, he said.\n",
      "“We don’t make promises. We make suggestions. Suggestions based on what we already have, we have already done…Our offer is under consideration for our Philippine partners so we are waiting for the feedback,” he added.\n",
      "‘Effective, safe’\n",
      "Khovaev also gave assurances that the vaccine being developed by Russia is “effective and safe.”\n",
      "He said the vaccine was tested on several volunteers and Russian scientists, all of whom have “healed well,” the envoy said.\n",
      "“All of them were tested on these vaccines and all of them feel well,” he added.\n",
      "“So, according to the analysis of our scientists, the results of the trials are very promising, very positive…The vaccine is effective and safe,” he further said.Moreover, Khovaev said his government is willing to comply with any necessary vaccine distribution procedure imposed by the Philippine government should Manila accept Russia’s offer.\n",
      "“We fully understand that you Filipinos have your own procedures in this field and all these procedures should be complied with. Of course, we comply with all domestic procedures in the Philippines,” he added.\n",
      "According to Khovaev, around 20 countries have already confirmed their interest to “closely cooperate” with Russia in terms of the COVID-19 vaccine.\n",
      "When asked about the status of Russia’s offer to the Philippines, the DFA said the proposals have already been referred to the appropriate agencies “for proper assessment and evaluation.”\n",
      "“The DFA conveys its appreciation for Russia’s willingness to assist the Philippines in its fight against COVID-19, as well as its offer to supply the SARS-COV-2 vaccine developed by N.F. Gamaleya of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation,” the DFA said in a message to reporters.\n",
      "The Philippine government has already reached out to various COVID-19 vaccine developers from the United States, Taiwan, China, and the United Kingdom for possible purchase once vaccines have been found and become available.\n",
      "Over 100 potential COVID-19 vaccines are currently in development worldwide.\n",
      "Earlier, Russia said it aims to launch mass production of a COVID-19 vaccine in September and turn out “several million” doses per month by next year.\n",
      "But after Moscow announced plans to start swiftly producing COVID-19 jabs, the World Health Organization urged the said country to follow the established guidelines for producing safe and effective vaccines. (With reports from Reuters)\n",

      "“They tested my antibodies again a couple of days [ago] and it was quite high. They told me you can wait, you are not the priority at this time,” he said.\n",

      "“Regardless of the vaccines, we have about almost close to 6,000 recipients. That would be from the doctors, nurses, down to support staff, administrative personnel, janitorial services, all of those about 6,000. So far we have as an allocation of 1,000 [doses] for Sinovac at least for the first few days just to see and if the numbers go up, we will ask for more,” he added.\n",

      "The delivery of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines is being held in abeyance pending Congress’ enactment of an indemnification law.\n",
      "That statement was made by Carlito Galvez Jr., the government’s point person on the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines, in a Senate hearing last week. He said that law was aimed at giving compensation to persons who may develop serious side effects from the vaccine.Under the proposed law, an indemnity fund would be established by companies that would supply the government with COVID-19 vaccines by depositing one percent of their contract price with the national treasury. The fund would be managed by a Vaccines Compensation Board.\n",
      "By requiring an indemnification law prior to the delivery of its vaccine, Pfizer wants to shield itself from possible damage suits in case its vaccine gives rise to serious medical issues to its recipient.\n",
      "If Pfizer’s indemnification scheme passes muster in Congress, all suppliers of government-authorized COVID-19 vaccines would benefit from it.\n",
      "The law would, in effect, shift the burden of compensating Filipinos who may suffer from vaccine-related illnesses from the pharmaceutical companies to the government.\n",
      "Pfizer cannot be faulted for thinking ahead before delivering its vaccine. Apparently, it does not want to find itself in the situation that fellow pharmaceutical company, Sanofi Pasteur Inc., is in at present in connection with deaths allegedly caused by Sanofi’s dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia.\n",
      "Recall that in 2017, Persida Acosta, the head of the Public Attorney’s Office, filed civil and criminal suits against the local branch of Sanofi and former officials of the Department of Health who approved Dengvaxia’s use. The cases are still pending in court.\n",
      "The business sector should take interest in the proposed indemnification fund. Although the COVID-19 vaccines developed by pharmaceutical companies have received approval from their regulators, there are lingering doubts about their efficacy to persons at certain age levels and to virus variants that have recently emerged.\n",
      "Despite those concerns, however, some private companies have been making arrangements, on their own, with pharmaceutical companies.\n",
      "Due to the delicate nature of the vaccine, not to mention its high cost, it is reasonable to assume these companies will strictly comply with the prescribed protocols on their delivery, storage and injection.If none of the employees who were injected do not suffer any serious side effects, well and good. The company and its employees can enjoy the comfort of a safe work environment.\n",
      "But sometimes good intentions do not translate to good results.\n",
      "In case (knock on wood) an employee injected with the vaccine develops serious medical side effects, would the company be obliged to provide him or her with the medical treatment needed to bring him or her back to good health?\n",
      "Strictly speaking, since the side effects came from the vaccine administered by the company, it can be held liable for the adverse effects of the injection. That would mean paying for the employee’s hospital bills and medicines and, probably, giving him or her leave with pay.\n",
      "The unintended or unexpected consequences of a vaccine gone wrong could put an additional financial burden on any company, more so if it is hardly able to keep its nose out of the water.\n",
      "If only for humanitarian reasons, however, desisting from giving employees the vaccine when the company can afford it because of possible post-injection expenses may not be a good move.\n",
      "In anticipation of any government-approved vaccine procured by the companies for their employees could result in serious medical side effects, the business sector should lobby in Congress for the inclusion of their employees in the indemnification fund.\n",
      "The fact that the companies did not go through the government procurement system in securing vaccines should not disqualify their staff from enjoying the benefits of the fund. The companies should even be commended for not using government funds to buy the vaccines.\n",
      "Lest we forget, employees of private companies are Filipino citizens, too, who are entitled to assistance and protection from the government. INQ\n",

      "International Labor Affairs Bureau Director Alice Visperas said Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III has spoken with the UK ambassador to the Philippines regarding the deal.Visperas said among the requests made by Bello to the UK government in exchange for the exemption on the deployment cap are the renewal of the 2002 and 2003 bilateral labor agreements between the UK and the Philippines, as well as the provision of vaccines.\n",
      "READ: UK, Germany want exemption from deployment limit of Filipino healthcare workers\n",
      "“Pangalawa, ‘yung hiling ni Secretary Bello na vaccine mula sa kanilang gobyerno ay mabigyan tayo dito sa Pilipinas lalong-lalo na para sa ating mga OFWs (overseas Filipino workers),” she said in an online media forum on Monday as she enumerated the requests made by the Labor Secretary.\n",
      "(The second request of Secretary Bello is the provision of vaccines from the UK government to the Philippines, especially for OFWs.)\n",
      "She added that the DOLE had requested the same from Germany.\n",
      "According to Visperas, Bello is considering exempting the two countries from the deployment cap if they will agree to the conditions set by the Philippine government.\n",
      "She said that if the UK and Germany would grant the request of DOLE, the vaccines would go to OFWs who were already repatriated and those who are departing for jobs abroad.\n",
      "Visperas also said no specific number of doses for the vaccines was mentioned, but added that the jabs may benefit around 600,000 OFWs since this is the number of overseas workers who were already repatriated or are again planning to leave the country.\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will lend to its host-country the Philippines at least $9.4 billion — possibly including about $400-500 million for COVID-19 vaccine procurement — in the next three years so the economy can bounce back from what seemed to be a slow recovery from the pandemic-induced recession so far.\n",
      "ADB vice president Ahmed M. Saeed said in a statement Wednesday, about two-thirds of the Manila-based multilateral lender’s Country Operations Business Plan 2021–2023 for the Philippines will support financing for infrastructure development, health care, and jobs recovery.Oscar Amiel A. Badiola, senior programs officer at the ADB’s Philippines country office, told a press briefing Wednesday that the lender extended to the Philippines a record-high $4.2 billion across 11 loans, of which the bulk had been geared towards immediate COVID-19 response.\n",
      "For 2021, the ADB plans to lend the Philippines a total of $3.57 billion across seven programs and projects, plus $800-million worth in five projects still on standby.\n",
      "Among the loans up for ADB approval next year were the $1.75-billion South Commuter Railway Project, Tranche 1; $500-million Building Up Implementation and Local Level Drivers for Universal Health Care; $400-million Facilitating Youth School-to-Work Transition, Subprogram 3; $400-million Local Governance Reform Program, Subprogram 2; $238-million Davao Public Transport Modernization Project; $180-million Metro Manila Bridges Project; and $100-million Sustainable Tourism Development Project.\n",
      "The projects on standby for possible ADB financing next year included the $400-million Integrated Flood Risk Management Sector Project, Phase 1, and $100 million in loans each for the following: Baguio City Sanitation Improvement Project; Integrating Innovation System in Philippine Technical and Vocational Education and Training; Mindanao Agro-Enterprise Development Project; and Mindanao Irrigation Development Project, Phase 1.\n",
      "Also, country director for the Philippines Kelly Bird said the ADB and the Philippine government were currently in talks to tap the new $9-billion Asia-Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX), under which member-countries can borrow $400-500 million for their COVID-19 vaccine procurement and rollout, next year.\n",
      "In case their discussions with the Philippines prosper, Bird said the APVAX financing will be over and above the ADB’s 2021 lending pipeline. “We are committed to supporting the Philippines in financing COVID-19 vaccines,” he said.\n",
      "Bird said the availability of vaccines will be a “big game-changer” to the economic outlook as inoculation would accelerate the resumption of business and consumer confidence upon containing the deadly coronavirus.\n",
      "The ADB projected a record 8.5-percent contraction in the Philippines’ gross domestic product (GDP) this year before a rebound of 6.5-percent growth next year.\n",
      "For 2022, the ADB’s pipeline of loans for the Philippines amounted to at least $2.92 billion, on top of a slightly bigger $2.95 billion in 2023.Bird noted that while there were “promising” green shoots being observed in recent manufacturing, goods exports, consumer spending, and cash remittances data, the recovery thus far had been “slow and fragile.”\n",
      "The longest and most stringent COVID-19 lockdown in the region not only pushed the economy into a recession but also would inflict a severe impact on the labor market and reverse gains in poverty reduction, Bird said.\n",
      "The ADB expects the unemployment rate to remain elevated at 8-9 percent during the first half of next year, Bird said, as the bigger share of new jobs were expected to be “lower quality” employment in the informal sector.\n",
      "As such, the poverty incidence rate may rise to 20.7 percent this year from a low of 16.7 percent in 2018, Bird added.\n",

      "Thanks to closer ties between Manila and Moscow, Russia’s COVID-19 vaccine may be manu­factured in the Philippines, the Department of Finance (DOF) said.\n",
      "In a statement on Friday, the DOF said outgoing Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev mentioned during his farewell courtesy call to Finance Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez III last Tuesday “the possibility of producing and distributing in the Philippines the vaccine developed by Russia.”Early this month, Khovaev told a business forum that the bilateral deal, which Russia had proposed to the Philippine government involved joint clinical trials as well as immediate provisioning of vaccine supplies here after the third and final phases and regulatory approval.\n",
      "The Philippines is supposedly being eyed to become the production hub for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine in Southeast Asia.\n",
      "Besides cooperation in vaccine production, Russia and the Philippines were also eyeing “possible agreement on energy cooperation to help boost the Philippines’ power generation capacity,” the DOF said.\n",
      "Dominguez had said last year that Russian investors were keen on developing power infrastructure projects, including wind farms, in the Philippines following President Duter­te’s visit to Russia.\n",
      "At that time, the Philippines and Russia also signed a memorandum of intent to explore the possible construction of nuclear power plants here.\n",
      "The President recently sought consultations to possibly reopen the mothballed Bataan nuclear power plant.\n",
      "Another area of cooperation discussed by Dominguez and Khovaev was in tax administration, including “a possible cooperation agreement between the Philippine Bureau of Customs and the Federal Customs Service of Russia,” the DOF said.\n",
      "Dominguez also asked Russia to help the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) establish an efficient value-added tax (VAT) collection system.\n",
      "In turn, Khovaev was quoted by the DOF as saying that “Russia has shared its VAT-collection technology with other countries and would assist the BIR in its effort to improve its system.”\n",

      "MANILA, Philippines — President Rodrigo Duterte was not asking for free vaccines, but only wanted the Philippines to have a guaranteed share when he threatened to continue with the abrogation of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) if the US could not provide its COVID-19 vaccines to the country, Malacañang clarified on Sunday.\n",
      "Duterte, in a speech on Saturday night, demanded at least 20 million doses of coronavirus vaccines from the U.S. to lift the termination of the VFA. \n",
      "“Hindi po, babayaran po natin. Ang problema lang po, yung supply. Ang sinasabi ng Presidente, at least bigyan niyo kami ng supply. Hindi naman tayo nanlilimos, meron naman tayong perang pambayad dyan at babayaran natin,” presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in an interview over Teleradyo.\n",
      "(No, we will pay. The problem is the supply. The President is saying that they should at least give us a supply. We’re not begging, we have money to pay for that and we will pay.)\n",

      "“Sa katunayan, mga pribadong sektor, mga lokal na pamahalaan, sila mismo ay nagbubudget para bumili. Kaya lang, yung supply ang pinaguusapan. So yun po yun. Hindi tayo humihingi ng libre, magbabayad tayo. Kailangan bigyan tayo ng supply gaya naman nung napagkasunduan ng ibang nauna,” he added.\n",
      "(In fact, the private sectors and local government units are setting aside a budget to procure the vaccines. But the supply is what we’re talking about. That’s it. We’re not asking for free vaccines, we will pay. They should give us a supply just like their agreements with those who secured them first.)\n",
      "It was in February when the Philippine government, upon instruction of Duterte, sent a notice to the U.S. embassy to terminate the VFA. It was supposed to take effect in August.\n",
      "Presidential spokesperson Atty. Harry Roque. YANCY LIM / PRESIDENTIAL FILE PHOTO\n",
      "However, the scrapping of VFA was shelved for six months in June. The six-month suspension ends this December.\n",
      "“Kung kinakailangan nilang ma-renew yung kanilang VFA para sa kanilang pangnasyonal na interes, importante sa Pilipinas na mabigay naman sila ng vaccine dahil yan ang kinakailangan natin para sa nasyonal na interes,” Roque said.\n",
      "(If they want to renew their VFA for their national interest, it is important for the Philippines to secure their vaccines because that’s our national interest.)\n",
      "“Yan po yung ibig sabihin ng Presidente, na hindi na po siya papayag na para bang tayo’y ina-under lang ng isang dating colonial nating master. So kailangan patas ang relasyon natin at kung hindi mabibigay ang vaccine sa atin, goodbye VFA ang sabi po ni Presidente,” he added.\n",

REYES\n",
      "The Philippines begins its COVID-19 vaccination drive on Monday with the first 600,000 doses of the donated Chinese vaccine CoronaVac in major government hospitals in Metro Manila.\n",
      "The country has been expecting a bigger launch, but the delivery of 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the global vaccine supply pool COVAX on Monday will be delayed by a week due to a supply problem, according to Health Secretary Francisco Duque III.President Duterte attended a ceremony to mark the arrival of the initial 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac at Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on Sunday afternoon. A Chinese military aircraft delivered the vaccines.\n",
      "“With this very important shipment, I am confident that more batches of vaccines will be available with great dispatch until every Filipino will be given the chance to be vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity,” Mr. Duterte said.\n",
      "The President said the Chinese donation underscored the friendly relations between Manila and Beijing.\n",
      "“I convey my sincere gratitude to the Chinese people and the government of China for this gesture of friendship and solidarity—the hallmark of Philippines-China partnership,” Mr. Duterte said.\n",
      "Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian said “more Chinese vaccines procured by the Philippine government will surely come soon as expected.”\n",
      "He was referring to 25 million doses of CoronaVac due to be delivered to the Philippines in batches this year.\n",
      "“It is a fine tradition between China and the Philippines to help each other in trying times. Our two governments and peoples have helped each other and joined hands to fight the pandemic since the outbreak of the virus, forging a closer China-Philippines partnership,” Huang said.\n",
      "With the arrival of the Sinovac vaccine, the Philippines’ vaccine rollout formally starts, said Carlito Galvez Jr., head of the National Task Force Against COVID-19 and chief implementer of the vaccination program.\n",
      "President Duterte ordered the first round of vaccinations to begin in the first week of March, after the delivery in February of the 117,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine from COVAX was delayed.Sen. Christopher “Bong” Go, the Senate health committee chair who is a former aide to the President, said vaccines for the Visayas and Mindanao would also arrive this month.\n",
      "Duque announced the delay in the delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccines in a television interview later Sunday.\n",
      "“We received communication earlier today that the delivery would be delayed by about a week,” Duque said. He quoted the World Health Organization (WHO) as saying the delay was due to a supply problem.\n",
      "Waiting for AstraZeneca\n",
      "Galvez said the AstraZeneca vaccines were part of the 5.5 million to 9 million doses the Philippines had requested from COVAX, a vaccine sharing scheme led by the WHO and the vaccine alliance GAVI to ensure an equitable vaccine supply to poor countries.\n",
      "The AstraZeneca vaccine offers front-line health workers an option as they decide whether to get inoculated.\n",
      "Many of them said they were willing to wait for the British-Swedish drug and step aside from the queue for CoronaVac, which had been found only 50.4 percent effective in protecting health workers in the COVID-19 wards.\n",
      "Dr. Tony Leachon, a health advocate and former consultant to the government’s pandemic managers, lauded the government effort, but said “I’d like to wait for AstraZeneca for the following reasons: higher efficacy rate, track record of the company, clinical study published in peer reviewed journal, [and] clinical studies reviewed and endorsed by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC).”\n",
      "“The fact that [health-care workers] now have a choice is better because the overarching consideration is to have them protected in the soonest possible time. They won’t feel forced if they didn’t like the other [brand],” Dr. Gene Nisperos of the Community Medicine Development Foundation said.\n",
      "SOLIDARITY President Duterte (fourth from right), here speaking with Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian on Sunday afternoon, hails China’s delivery of an initial 600,000 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac as a “gesture of friendship and solidarity.” —RICHARD A. REYES\n",
      "Healthcare Professionals Alliance Against COVID-19 said its members would also await the HTAC recommendation. It “will help us decide if we will accept [CoronaVac],” said Dr. Antonio Dans, spokesperson for the group.\n",
      "Dans said HTAC, an independent council of medical experts that advises the Department of Health (DOH), is set to review Sinovac’s trial data this week.\n",
      "Regardless of the brand, Dans said, “as long as it is [approved by] the Food and Drug Administration and HTAC, we believe the best vaccine is the one in your arm.”\n",
      "Dr. Jonas del Rosario, spokesperson for Philippine General Hospital (PGH), said the latest survey of the hospital’s personnel showed 12 percent of the staff were willing to be inoculated with CoronaVac.\n",
      "“This is only voluntary. We won’t force it on anyone. The doctors, nurses and other PGH employees have the right of refusal,” said Del Rosario, a COVID-19 survivor who lost both parents to the disease. It was announced earlier that he would be the first to get inoculated at the hospital.\n",
      "100K shots for military\n",
      "Of the 600,000 doses of CoronaVac that arrived on Sunday, 100,000 doses will go to the military. The rest will be given to health workers.\n",
      "Five to six police-escorted refrigerated vans transported the CoronaVac shots delivered on Sunday through C5 Road to the MetroPac Movers Inc. (MMI), a third-party logistics and storage provider of the DOH at Barangay Concepcion I in Marikina City.\n",
      "From MMI, a few hundred doses were transported late in the evening to PGH, Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium (Tala), Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital in Camp Crame, and Victoriano Luna Medical Center.\n",
