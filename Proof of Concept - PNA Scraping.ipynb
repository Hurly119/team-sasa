      "Senator Christopher “Bong” Go and President Rodrigo Duterte (File photo)\n",
      "MANILA – Senator Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go is eyeing the presidential seat next year, President Rodrigo Duterte said on Thursday.\n",
      "Duterte made the announcement when he introduced Go during the inauguration of the newly-constructed Port Operations Building at the Port of Dumaguete in Dumaguete City, Negros Oriental.\n",
      "In his speech, he said Go had asked him a favor to tell the public about the lawmaker’s supposed plan to join the 2022 presidential race.\n",
      "“Itong si Senator Bong Go, pababa kami sa eroplano, sabi niya na ‘Sir, may hingin sana ako saýo ng pabor.’ Sabi ko, ‘Ano?’ Sabi niya, ‘Medyo, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth, malayo pa pero ikaw na lang ang mag-sabi sa kanila.’ Sabihin ko, ang totoo talaga, isang bagay lang. Sabihin daw sa inyo, gusto niya maging president (Senator Bong Go, when we were about to disembark from the plane, said, ‘Sir, I have a favor to ask.’ I asked him, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘It somehow leaves a bad taste in the mouth, it’s still far but I want you to tell them.’ I will tell you the truth. He wants me to tell you that he wants to be president),” Duterte said, drawing cheers from the crowd.\n",
      "It was, however, unclear whether he was serious when he made the remarks.\n",
      "Go, who joined the event, was seen shaking his head in disapproval.\n",
      "Duterte’s latest statement came despite Go’s insistence that he is not gunning for the presidency in 2022.\n",
      "It also came amid calls for Go and Duterte to run for president and vice president, respectively.\n",
      "Earlier Thursday, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque recalled Duterte’s previous statement that the Chief Executive has no plan to become the country’s next vice president next year.\n",
      "Sal Panelo as ‘good senator someday’\n",
      "Meanwhile, Duterte also hinted at the possibility that his top lawyer, Chief Presidential Legal Counsel, might seek a seat at the Senate in the 2022 national and local elections.\n",
      "This was after Duterte alluded that Panelo could be a “good senator” in the future.\n",
      "He also praised Panelo’s credentials, noting that the Palace official’s former clients include celebrities.\n",
      "“Sal Panelo is the lawyer. Ito ‘yung abugado ng mga artista. Totoo, ‘yung mga iskandalo, nag-aaway. Kaniya iyang lahat. High profile itong si Sal (He is the lawyer of the stars. That’s true, he defended those involved in scandals. That’s him. Sal is high-profile). And maybe, he would make a good senator someday,” Duterte said.\n",

That will depend on the extent and the efficacy of the vaccination program of countries worldwide, so I want to say 80,000 to 100,000 in the course of the year but I think that is dependent on how the vaccination program of the whole world.

      "MANILA – Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo on Wednesday expressed confidence that the “three-pronged strategy” crafted by the country’s economic team would generate more job opportunities in the country.\n",
      "“Para mapabilis ‘yung ating pagbabalik sa dati nating malusog na ekonomiya at yung pagbabalik sa mga trabaho, ‘yung ating mga economic managers ay merong sinasabing tatlong istratehiya (To restore our robust economy and create more jobs, our economic managers have three strategies),” Panelo said in his commentary show “Counterpoint”.\n",
      "About four million adult Filipinos were left jobless in January this year despite the gradual reopening of the Philippine economy amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.\n",
      "Unemployment worsened to 8.7 percent in January from 5.3 percent in the same month last year, according to the preliminary results of the Philippine Statistics Authority’s labor force survey released on Tuesday.\n",

      "To address unemployment, Panelo said the country’s economic managers have come up with strategies to accelerate job creation.\n",
      "These strategies, he said, are the safe reopening of the economy, the full implementation of the recovery package, and the timely implementation of the Covid-19 vaccine program.\n",
      "Citing the latest labor force survey data released by the National Economic and Development Authority, Panelo noted that about 1.4 million jobs lost due to the pandemic have been restored.\n",
      "He added that the unemployment rate decreased from 12.4 percent to 8.8 percent last January.\n",

      " “Our objective is by mid-year we’re done inoculating our health care workers and senior citizens. That’s in time with the arrival of Moderna and other vaccines, then we can start the vaccination for the general public,” Dizon said in Filipino.\n",

      "“To revive the economy, it is very important that the tourism sector should also be revived,” he said in a press conference streamed at the Facebook page of the Kalibo Cable TV Network Inc.\n",

      "MANILA – Further reopening of the domestic economy and easing of movement restrictions are seen to help address the country’s unemployment rate, which stood at 8.7 percent in January 2021. \n",
      " Economists expect the unemployment rate to remain around this level until next year given the impact of the pandemic on businesses and the job market. \n",
      " In a report, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said the latest unemployment figure “still reflects the relatively slower pace of economic recovery despite the Christmas season that just passed, as Metro Manila remained under GCQ (general community quarantine) since June 2020.” \n",
      " “Thus, further reopening of the economy would provide a structural and more sustainable solution in terms of increased production, sales, incomes/livelihood that also create/entail more employment/jobs and more working hours,” he said. \n",
      " Ricafort said the proposed shift to modified GCQ (MGCQ) alongside the easing of travel restrictions and those being implemented for public transportation “would help create more employment/jobs and help further lower unemployment and underemployment.”\n",
      " An additional plus to this factor is the higher government spending on infrastructure and the election-related spending for next year’s national polls.\n",
      " He added, “the proposed MGCQ nationwide and any other additional measures to reopen the economy would be a function of additional Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) vaccine arrivals and rollouts as well as any reduction in new Covid-19 local cases.”\n",
      " ING Bank Manila senior economist Nicholas Mapa said the pandemic and its resulting economic scarring is now taking root as shown by the unemployment rate. \n",
      " He said despite the easing of movement restrictions, “the labor market remains just as challenged with the latest unemployment rate.”\n",
      " “This translates to four million Filipinos without a job which will likely complicate the expected pickup in consumer spending should the government’s wish to move to MGCQ be granted,” he added.\n",
      " Mapa said the rise of unemployment and underemployment, which rose to 16 percent last January from 14.4 percent in the last quarter of 2020, “point to subdued access to income and likely muted purchasing power, now all the more problematic given the rise in inflation.”\n",
      " “The high level of unemployment will be around even if we relax quarantine measures as the scarring effects of closed businesses and jobs lost become more entrenched and the economy slowly spirals into lower levels of GDP (gross domestic product),” he added. (PNA)\n",

      "DOH-7 chief pathologist Dr. Mary Jean Loreche said the healthcare workers (HCWs) from level 1 and 2 non-government hospitals are likewise scheduled for inoculation using the CoronaVac jabs from China’s Sinovac Biotech company.\n",
      "Loreche said 2,468 doses of CoronaVac vaccines have been allocated to Chong Hua Hospital-Fuente; 1,585 doses for Cebu Doctors’ University Hospital; 1,200 for Perpetual Succor Hospital; 1,111 doses for Chong Hua Hospital-Mandaue; 414 doses for Cebu South General Hospital; 364 doses for Cebu North General Hospital; and 560 doses for Mactan Doctor’s Hospital.\n",
      "These hospitals simultaneously administered Tuesday the China-made vaccines to their medical workers.\n",
      "Loreche said the University of Cebu Medical Center (UCMed) has an allocation of 1,230 doses. However, the DOH Sinovac jabs are yet to be delivered pending inspection of their cold chain facility.\n",
      "Perpetual Succor Hospital vaccination point-person, Dr. Elrey Inocian, told the media that they targeted to inoculate 600 of the 1,107 HCWs in this private hospital run by a Roman Catholic congregation of the Sisters of St. Paul of Chartres.\n",
      "With 120 vaccinees per day, Inocian said they expect to finish the inoculation in five days. \n",
      "“Most of them who come today for vaccination are off from their duty. We give them the freedom to choose a day in time that they do not have work so that they can rest after the inoculation,” Inocian said in Cebuano.\n",
      "The hospital established a hotline for adverse reactions from the vaccine, he said, adding that each vaccinee has been given a three-hour observation period after the inoculation to monitor any adverse reactions.\n",
      "Inocian said the vaccinees would get the second dose within 28 days “in order to reach the efficacy rate of 98 percent” of the CoronaVac jabs.\n",
      "Aside from Perpetual Succor Hospital, other hospitals that simultaneously administered CoronaVac to their medical employees are the Cebu Doctors’ Hospital Group and Chong Hua Hospital.\n",
      "Cebu Doctors’ Hospital Group owner, Dr. Potenciano Larrazabal III, was among the hundreds of front-liners who took the CoronaVac jabs on Tuesday.\n",
      "Larrazabal, a well-known eye specialist, said getting any available vaccine would help the population to achieve immunity against coronavirus disease.\n",

So vaccination is the way to go if we want to attain herd immunity. That is why I advise our family - the CebuDoc Group to please join this activity. I believe the best vaccine is the first vaccine on hand, and I am here to prove that as I receive the first vaccine today,” Larrazabal said in a statement posted on social media.\n",

      "DAGUPAN CITY – Most of the healthcare workers in Region 1 Medical Center (R1MC) here who were vaccinated with the first batch of Sinovac vaccines said they got it to protect themselves, the patients, and their families.\n",
      " \"I feel privileged and happy to be one of the recipients of Sinovac vaccine. This is for my family, my patients. Thank you DOH (Department of Health), thank you R1MC,\" said Dr. Agnes Dimaano, a medical specialist from the Department of Pediatrics in R1MC.\n",
      " Dimaano was the first to be inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine in Pangasinan and in the entire Ilocos Region.\n",
      " \"I am so happy being vaccinated. I expose myself daily with Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) with my mask and face shield as my only protection. Now with the vaccine, I am more confidently safe caring and treating patients with Covid-19. Humanity wins over viruses,\" said Dr. Rowena Virrey, infectious disease medical specialist.\n",
      " Dr. May Fernandez Gonzales, dermatologist at R1MC, said she got vaccinated along with two of her family members.\n",
      " \"This also became a family affair since I had it with my sister and brother-in-law. We encourage more healthcare workers to get the vaccine for your family, patients, and other people you mingle with,\" she said. \n",
      " Dr. John Fernandez, a pediatric intensivist, said he chose to be vaccinated as he believed it would help him better protect his family, his critically-ill pediatric patients, his co-workers, and his own health.\n",
      " The vaccine acceptability among frontline health workers in the eight referral hospitals in the Ilocos Region, including R1MC, is increasing amid the arrival of doses of vaccines in the region, according to DOH Center for Health and Development Ilocos regional office (DOH-CHD-1) information officer Dr. Rheuel Bobis.\n",
      " In an interview on Tuesday, Bobis said that from the 41-percent acceptability prior to the arrival of the vaccines, the percentage of health workers who want to be inoculated is increasing daily.\n",
      " “They are excited for the vaccines as this is a big step in getting immunity against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). They are also glad as they now have a new weapon against the virus,” he said.\n",
      " On Monday night, some 25,600 doses of both Sinovac and Astrazeneca vaccines arrived at the DOH-CHD-1 office here.\n",
      " Bobis said the 10,000 doses of Astrazeneca vaccines will be given to the frontline medical workers aged 60 and above in the eight referral hospitals in the region, while the 14,400 Sinovac vaccines will be distributed to the medical workers both in public and private hospitals in the region catering to Covid-19 patients.\n",
      " “We will prioritize with Astrazeneca vaccines the senior citizen medical workers who have direct exposure to Covid-19 patients in the eight referral hospitals since Sinovac is prohibited to senior citizens. The new batch of Sinovac vaccines will be distributed today to the Provincial Health Office of La Union and Lorma Medical Center and other private and district hospitals in La Union, Ilocos Norte, and Dagupan City and tomorrow at Ilocos Sur and Pangasinan,” he added.\n",
      " The 1,200 doses, Bobis said, are allocated for the Armed Forces of the Philippines and Naval Forces Northern Luzon.\n",
      " “It is part of the 100,000 Sinovac vaccine allocation of the Department of National Defense,” he said.\n",
      " Bobis also attributed the increasing vaccine acceptability among medical front-liners in the eight referral hospitals to the effects of the vaccine to the first batch of workers inoculated.\n",
      " Out of the over 2,000 frontline health workers inoculated with Sinovac vaccine as of Monday, only seven of them experienced minor side effects that are common and not life-threatening, he said.\n",
      " “On the fourth day of our vaccination with Sinovac among health workers in the eight coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) referral hospitals in the region, seven health workers experienced respectively, the heaviness of the arm, redness and or irritation in the area vaccinated, and one with fever,” he added.\n",

      "GENERAL SANTOS CITY – Two elderly practicing doctors have availed of the Sinovac vaccines in the first two days of inoculation for priority frontline health care workers here, an official said on Tuesday.\n",
      "Dr. Ryan Aplicador, deputy incident commander of the City Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases, said Dr. Wilfredo Garcia, 70, and Dr. Benjamin Pagarigan Jr., 69, were vaccinated with their first doses on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.\n",
      "He said the two, who are still serving at the local government-run Dr. Jorge P. Royeca Hospital (DJPRH), volunteered to get the CoronaVac, the vaccine’s trade name, despite being properly informed that it was not recommended for them due to lack of clinical trials.\n",
      "The Department of Health (DOH) only recommended the vaccine to individuals aged 18 to 59 years old based on its “higher efficacy” rate.\n",
      "But, Aplicador said the two doctors signed waivers that they want to receive the CoronaVac vaccine and submitted clearances from their personal doctors.\n",
      "Aside from them, he said several health workers who have diabetes and hypertension were vaccinated after passing the mandatory screening.\n",
      "“As of now, they are all in good condition and did not experience any adverse side effects,” Aplicador told reporters.\n",

      "Dr. Carina Frayco, an infectious diseases specialist (IDS), said it is vital for her work as a medical front-liner to get protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).\n",
      "“As an IDS, I am grateful that I’m able to participate and especially I’m one of the first who received the Sinovac. This is important in my line of work, in my line of duty as a front-liner, and also for my own protection, for my family, and for the whole community,” Frayco said in an interview after taking the first shot.\n",
      "“Although it will be a long time that we can achieve herd immunity, but I’m happy that step by step, or what we call baby steps, we can achieve our goal to end this pandemic,” she added.\n",
      "At the CLMMRH, only about 50 percent of the 1,743 hospital staff has consented to avail of Sinovac shots for varying reasons – some are already above 60 years old, some have existing medical conditions, and some are hesitant because of the brand, Frayco said.\n",
      "“I hope that in the next few days after they will see that I’m okay, that I didn’t experience major side effects, it will encourage healthcare workers to take part in the vaccination program. We should be grateful for what we have now if we want to be protected,” she said.\n",

If we are to survive this generation, we must stand united and strong. Keep the negativities and politics behind. We will do this because we love ourselves, our families, and our community,” he said.\n",
      "WVSUMC officer-in-charge Dr. Dave Endel Gelito III, in his message, said that they have been gifted with “something more than a mask, PPE (personal protective equipment)”. What was given, he said, was a chance to get protected from the virus and “regain freedom from the shackles of Covid-19”.\n",
      "“As I receive my first dose of Sinovac, I would like to appeal to more of my fellow healthcare workers to avail of this vaccine. With the recent surges in Manila and Cebu, I believe the earlier we get protection, the better for all of us,” he said.\n",

Duterte on Monday night (March 8, 2021) said Robredo caused doubt when she called for a review of Sinovac's CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine by the Health Technology Assessment Council just as the government was boosting public confidence in the vaccines. (Presidential file photo)\n",
      "MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday night said Vice President Leni Robredo’s call for a review of Sinovac's CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine by the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) created doubt just as the government was boosting public confidence in the vaccines.\n",
      "In a pre-recorded public address, Duterte said Robredo did the public a “disservice” by supposedly making it appear that the government was skipping regulatory processes for vaccines.\n",
      "He insisted that an HTAC review is only recommendatory and is not required before the government can roll out vaccines.\n",
      "“Ang ginawa niyang disservice to the people is noong hindi niya sinabi na recommendatory (She did a great disservice to the people when she didn’t say that it was recommendatory),” he said.\n",

      "The donated Sinovac shots, he said, are not yet required to undergo an HTAC review because these were donated and not procured by the government.\n",

Now, here comes the statement na hindi niya --- hindi niya binasa kumpleto ang batas (she made without completely reading the law), with just a simple statement, magke-create ka ng (you’re creating) doubt,” he said.\n",
      "He blamed Robredo’s call for an HTAC review as the reason why more individuals rejected the Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines.\n",
      "“We were doing everything convincing, spending most of our time convincing the people that it is safe. Ang bakuna is safe. Now, if you create that uncertainty in the minds of the people mas maraming ayaw (there would be more who would refuse to get vaccinated),” he said.\n",
      "Duterte expressed frustration over how Robredo relied on “half-truths” when she failed to read the UHC law.\n",
      "“Medyo galit ako (I’m slightly angry) for coming with a half-truth na basahin mo kalahati lang (where you read just half of the law),” he said.\n",
      "Instead of joining the government’s efforts to promote vaccine confidence, he said Robredo “muddled up everything.”\n",
      "“I said, creating an uncertainty and doubt in the minds of the people. So ‘yon ang nagalitan ko (So that’s why I’m angry) because we were running against time, kailangan mabakuna na agad (we needed to start vaccination immediately),” he said.\n",
      "He, meanwhile, appealed to Robredo to stay quiet if she is unsure of her statements.\n",

      "“We should not be reluctant about the vaccine and be prepared for the vaccine, we need to be inoculated so that we can alleviate the loss of dear lives,” said CBCP-ECH vice chairman Bishop Oscar Jaime Florencio.\n",
      "He said the public should make use of the available vaccine after the government announced that another 1.4 million doses of Sinovac CoronaVac vaccine are set to arrive on March 21.\n",
      "Aside from the CoronaVac jabs, the country is slated to receive around 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines through the COVAX Facility, to be delivered until May.\n",
      "On Sunday, Moderna Inc. announced it has signed a supply agreement with the Philippines for 13 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine that will arrive by the third quarter of this year.\n",
      "“We know that this Covid will stay even without vaccine or with vaccine. They will stay with us for a while. Now, we know that there is already an available vaccine out there, it might not be enough, but it is there already and for us Catholic this may be the answer to our Oratio Imperata. Why not avail for those who are given the slots. Otherwise, our Oratio will be useless,” he said in an interview.\n",
      "The Philippines received its first batch of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccine on Feb. 28 donated by China and 520,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine that arrived in two batches through COVAX Facility on March 4 and 7.\n",
      "As for those who expressed concerns about the Covid-19 vaccine side effects, Florencio said the faithful are not being forced to have the vaccine.\n",

      "MANILA – There is no need to revert to a stricter community quarantine classification in Metro Manila despite surge in Covid-19 cases, Malacañang said Monday.\n",
      "Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said a stricter quarantine status is not yet necessary since the country’s current healthcare capacity is able to handle the rise in Covid-19 cases.\n",
      "“For the month of March, I don’t think it is called for. Bakit po? Kasi talagang datos po ang ating pinagbabasehan (Why? Because data is our basis),” he said in a Palace press briefing.\n",
      "Citing data from the health department, Roque said 60 percent of 1,900 intensive care unit (ICU) beds are still available while 65 percent of 13,500 isolation beds remain unoccupied and 75 percent of 6,000 ward beds are also still vacant.\n",
      "Roque emphasized the need for local government units (LGUs) to step up on their efforts to test, trace, and treat.\n",
      "“Inaatasan na po natin ang lahat kasama na po ang ating mga lokal na pamahalaan na hindi lang paigtingin ang ating minimum health standards, ipatupad na po natin iyong ating institutional isolation ng mga nagkakasakit. Kinakailangan paigtingin na natin iyong ating tracing at kinakailangan i-isolate din natin iyong mga tao na nagkaroon na ng close contact at bigyan ng [polymerase chain reaction] test iyong mga taong nagkaroon na ng close contact (We direct the local governments not just to enhance the implementation of minimum health standards, but also implement institutional isolation of those infected. We need to enhance tracing and isolation of those with close contact and give PCR tests to those who have had close contract),” he said.\n",
      "He said LGUs also have the power to impose localized or granular lockdowns in areas with a surge in Covid-19 cases.\n",
      "“Iyong kalye, iyong bahay, iyong compound na mayroong mga maraming sakit, i-lockdown ninyo na po iyan dahil iyan po talaga ang ating istratehiya ngayon (Implement a lockdown in the street, house, compound with high cases because that’s really the strategy now),” he added.\n",
      "Roque said the Philippine economy could not afford to revert to a stricter community status as many were going hunger and between jobs.\n",
      "Former Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit, for his part, attributed the surge in Covid-19 cases to a drop in compliance with minimum health and safety standards.\n",
      "\"Ang tingin ko (I think) the surge is actually due to a drop in compliance, which we can fix, and also an increase in mobility. Diyan natin kailangan ibalanse (That’s what we need to balance) because we want to open the economy,” he said.\n",
      "Roque appealed to the public not to get tired observing minimum health standards such as wearing of face masks and face shields, frequent hand-washing, and physical distancing.\n",
      "“Aking pakiusap, huwag po kayong mapagod kasi ngayon ay nandito na ang bakuna, narito na iyong simula ng katapusan ng ating problema (Our appeal is, don’t get tired because the vaccine is here, this is the beginning of the end of our problem),” he said.\n",

      "As of Monday, health authorities recorded 3,356 additional Covid-19 cases bringing the total number of cases in the country to 597,763. This is the fourth consecutive day that more than Covid-19 cases breached the 3,000 mark.\n",
      "Recoveries reached 545,912 after six more people got well and five more deaths brought the death toll to 12,521.\n",

      "\"We've already concluded the agreement, 'yong supply na lang (the only problem now is the supply), we're threshing out the supply kung kailan nila puwedeng i-deliver itong (when they can deliver) Moderna,\" he said.\n",
      "\"We're hoping that we will have the first deliveries by either end of May or early part of June,\" he added.\n",
      "Romualdez said Manila was able to secure about 20 million doses of vaccines developed by the American firm, along with the private sector which helped purchase the vials.\n",
      "“Almost half of that will go to the private sector and their employees, malaking force 'yan (that's a big force). And then the other half will go to our health workers and the rest of Filipinos that will be receiving the Moderna through the LGUs (local government units) and other entities there in the Philippines,” he said.\n",
      "The envoy is confident that the delivery would be no later than the second half of the year as America ramps up its vaccine production.\n",
      "He said at least 117,000 Pfizer vaccines were negotiated through the COVAX Facility, a mechanism that guarantees fair and equitable access to Covid-19 jabs for low to middle-income countries.\n",
      "Romualdez added that around four million Janssen Covid-19 vaccines were \"readied\" for the Philippines, although the pharmaceutical firm has yet to commit on the delivery date as most of the vaccine manufacturers in the United States are focused on the inoculation of at least 70 percent of the American population.

      "MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte’s independent foreign policy has helped the Philippines acquire coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines developed by China and the United Kingdom (UK), Malacañang said on Friday.\n",
      "“Ang ating independent foreign policy, iyan po ang dahilan ngayon kung bakit isa na po tayo sa mga bansang nagbabakuna (Our independent foreign policy is the reason why we are one of the countries that can administer vaccines to their citizens),” Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said during the launch of a vaccination drive in Davao City.\n",
      "The Philippines kicked off its free vaccination campaign on Monday, a day after the Chinese government donated around 600,000 Covid-19 vaccine vials made by Chinese pharmaceutical giant Sinovac Biotech.\n",
      "On Thursday, the Philippines also received some 487,200 vaccine doses developed by British drugmaker AstraZeneca.\n",
      "The first batch of AstraZeneca vaccines delivered to the country forms part of the 44 million vaccine shots that will be donated to the Philippines through the Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) facility.\n",
      "The 487,2000 Covid-19 vaccines manufactured by AstraZeneca were donated to the Philippines by Germany, the European Union, Norway, France, Australia, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Austria, and Greece.\n",
      "In a speech delivered Thursday night, Duterte said China would also donate additional 400,000 doses of Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines, making its donation to the Philippines one million.\n",
      "The Philippines would have failed to secure Covid-19 vaccines, had Duterte decided not to implement his independent foreign policy of being “friend to all, enemy to none,” Roque said.\n",
      "“Kung hindi po tayo nagkaroon ng polisiya made in Davao na tinatawag na independent foreign policy – kaibigan ng lahat at kaaway ng walang kahit sino – hindi po tayo makakatanggap hindi lamang ng 600,000 doses ng Sinovac, kung hindi one million doses (If we had not implemented the policy made in Davao and dubbed as foreign policy of being friend to all and enemy to none, we would have failed to get not only 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines but one million doses),” he said.\n",
      "Duterte has pursued an independent foreign policy meant to maintain good relations with all nations and avoid siding with other countries.\n",
      "Roque hoped critics would no longer find fault with Duterte’s foreign policy after it paved the way for the Philippines’ successful launching of its mass vaccination program.\n",
      "“Sana po wala ng magdududa na tama po ang ginawang polisiya ng ating Presidente dahil kung wala po itong polisiyang ito, wala nga pong bakuna ngayon (I hope no one would no longer doubt the President’s foreign policy because we would have failed to secure vaccines if we had not pursued this),” he said.\n",

      " “Well you know, the usual thing that you feel when you have your vaccines. When I had my flu shot, my pneumococcal shot, there is a little pain I felt in (the) injection site. Other than that, I feel well, I feel okay and elated, actually,” Loreche told reporters.\n",
      "Aquino said getting a shot of the coronavirus disease vaccine is “like getting injected with other vaccines.”\n",
      "He received the first dose from Health Undersecretary Gerardo Bayugo.\n",

      "Like other hospital staff who underwent counseling, Aquino, Loreche, Feliciano, and the two hospital chiefs also received post-inoculation interviews.\n",

      "MANILA – The national government will stick to its Covid-19 National Vaccination Plan, Malacañang said Thursday after some ranking government officials, who are not frontline medical workers, reportedly received the Sinovac-made CoronaVac jab.\n",
      "Under the government’s prioritization list, frontline healthcare workers are supposedly first in line to be administered with the vaccine brand of their choice.\n",
      "However, some government officials including the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya and Metro Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chief of staff Michael Salalima had already received the CoronaVac shot.\n",
      "Other officials who received the vaccine are Pasay City Vice Mayor Noel Boyet Del Rosario and Manila Vice Mayor Honey Lacuna-Pangan, who is also a doctor.\n",
      "President Rodrigo Duterte earlier ordered only three officials -- vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., testing czar Vince Dizon, and MMDA chairperson Benhur Abalos -- to get inoculated to boost confidence in the vaccine.\n",
      "Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director General Eric Domingo was also allowed to receive the CoronaVac jab.\n",
      "In a Palace press briefing, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said Malaya and Salalima, who were both vaccinated at the Pasay City General Hospital on Tuesday, were “prompted” by hospital officials to also receive the CoronaVac vaccine.\n",
      "“The two naman, in good faith, thought that they were doing the nation a service by having themselves vaccinated kasi nga mataas pa yung tinatawag nating distrust sa bakuna (because there is still high distrust in the vaccines). So upon being prodded and being offered and guided by their desire to increase public confidence in the vaccine, nagpabakuna po sila (they had themselves vaccinated),” he said.\n",
      "He admitted that the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group’s (iNITAG) strict policy to stick to the prioritization list was “not disseminated properly.”\n",
      "“Hindi talaga niya alam na hindi na-approve yung gusto namin na mga taong gobyerno ang magpapturok para nga ma-increase po ang vaccine confidence. Dahil nga po ang desisyon naman ng iNITAG na huwag na bakunahan ang iba pang mga tao (He really didn’t know that our proposal to have government officials vaccinated to boost vaccine confidence was not approved. Because of the decision of iNITAG not to vaccinate officials) beyond Secretary Galvez, Secretary Dizon, and Chairman Abalos was not really disseminated properly,” he said.\n",
      "Roque admitted that there were some “breaches” in the protocol but assured that it is now clear that only frontline healthcare workers are allowed to receive vaccines first.\n",
      "“Hindi po tayo perfect sa pagpapatupad nitong protocol, nagkaroon tayo ng kakaunting breaches pero we (We’re not perfect when it comes to implementing protocols, there were few breaches but we) have learned from the breaches and now everyone knows medical front-liners muna (first),” he said.\n",
      "Medical front-liners still the priority\n",
      "Following the expected arrival of 487,200 doses of United Kingdom’s AstraZeneca vaccines on Thursday night, Roque assured that frontline healthcare workers will still be the first group to receive the vaccines.\n",
      "The AstraZeneca vaccine will be the second vaccine brand to arrive in the country after China’s Sinovac vaccines arrived last Sunday.\n",
      "“The only thing I can be sure of is uunahin ang medical front-liners (medical front-liners will still go first). But the iNITAG would have to come up with that protocol. But I suppose they will follow the same protocol priority,” he said.\n",
      "Earlier, Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunizations (NACI) recommended against using the AstraZeneca vaccines in people aged 65 and older.\n",
      "Roque, however, allayed fears over the safety and efficacy of the UK-manufactured vaccine, noting that no less than the World Health Organization (WHO) has given it clearance for emergency use.\n",
      "“I don’t think it is something that should be a basis para mag-atubili na naman sa AstraZeneca. Itong AstraZeneca po ay (to have hesitations again about AstraZeneca). This AstraZeneca is) equally as popular as Pfizer,” he said. (PNA)\n",

      "They are working on how to directly secure slots from the 30 million doses initially reserved for the Philippine government, he added.\n",
      "“We are now in exploratory talks with the makers of Covovax and our next step is to reach out to sugar federations all over the country as well as to LGUs to speed up this process so we can help jumpstart the economy which will also be good for the industry,” Yulo, who hails from Negros Occidental and the representative of the planters’ sector in the SRA Board, said.\n",

There's a supply shortage that's why the delivery of vaccines is often delayed),\" Duque said during the symbolic vaccination rollout at the St. Luke's Medical Center in Quezon City on Wednesday afternoon.\n",
      "He said even the World Health Organization (WHO) admitted that it has yet to begin the inoculation of most low- and middle-income countries.\n",
      "The government, meanwhile, maintained it is doubling its efforts to hasten the delivery of secured vaccines under the COVAX Facility.\n",
      "During the event, Duque cited the huge contribution of the private sector in the country's fight against the pandemic.\n",
      "\"We have always been of the strong belief in the complementarity between the national government and the private sector's capacities,\" he said. \"We have seen that the capacity of St. Luke's is huge, therefore impactful.\"\n",
      "Duque assured all government-procured vaccines for Covid-19 are safe for public use as he urged them to get vaccinated.\n",
      "\"As of today, there's a demand of 3.4 million doses of vaccines, whatever vaccines, for 1.7 million health care workers across the country. On Sunday, we received only 600,000 doses of vaccines and if you do your math easily this is less than 20 percent – or 17 percent to be exact – of the total requirement of the health care workers,\" he said. \"Don't hesitate. Let's line up for the vaccination.\"\n",
      "Duque insisted the vaccine is safe and effective as it underwent stringent protocols of the health authorities. (PNA)\n",

      "The statement comes following a study that showed AstraZeneca shots offer as little as 10 percent protection against the B.1.351 variant, which was first detected in South Africa.\n",
      "Abeyasinghe said the WHO is looking \"very carefully\" at these reports but noted that the study was conducted on a \"very limited scale\" with a sample of fewer than 2,000 people.\n",

      "The prioritized groups he mentioned include some 1.8 million Filipino healthcare workers who are among the most at risk in the still-raging pandemic.\n",
      "This is followed by the most vulnerable population -- the elderly and those suffering from comorbidities, where high case fatality rates were previously recorded.\n",
      "“If we cannot demonstrate that we are following this prioritization, unfortunately, the COVAX may have to consider other options where the impact of the vaccine rollout will be more useful and practical and will contribute to saving more lives,” Abeyasinghe said.\n",

      "MANILA – President Rodrigo Duterte has stood pat on his statement that the government will not force Filipinos to get inoculated with a Covid-19 vaccine, a Palace official said Thursday.\n",
      "Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles made this remark after a group of labor unions expressed concern over an “emerging” policy of some businesses requiring their workers to get vaccinated against Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to work.\n",
      "China’s donated 600,000 doses of Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccines is the only vaccine brand currently available in the country. However, a number of frontline medical workers have refused to be injected with CoronaVac over efficacy doubts.\n",
      "The government aims to inoculate 50 million to 70 million Filipinos nationwide, but it is not making inoculation against Covid-19 mandatory.\n",

Although he and the entire government is encouraging the public to accept the vaccine without hesitation when the time comes that they are next in line to receive the vaccine),” Nograles said in a virtual presser.\n",

      "Lorenzana made the call amid the controversy surrounding the PHP20 billion slashed from the Pension and Gratuity Fund (PGF) for retired uniformed personnel under the 2021 General Appropriations Act.\n",
      "In an interview during his courtesy call to Speaker Lord Allan Velasco at the House of Representatives, Lorenzana said he believes “there’s no harm done” with the delay in the payment of 2018 pension differentials to retired MUP.\n",
      "“Ito lang po ang paalala natin sa pensioners na nagde-demand na makuha na ‘yung arrears ng 2018 na kung pwede lang po sana ay maghintay lang tayo ng konting panahon dahil ‘yung pera kinain ng Covid at marami tayong pagkakagastusan dito. Bibili pa tayo ng vaccines so baka hindi kayanin (Our reminder to our pensioners who are demanding to get their arrears for 2018 is to wait for a while because the funding was diverted for Covid and we have a lot of expenses for this. We still have to purchase vaccines so [the budget] might not even be enough),” Lorenzana said.\n",
      "Lorenzana said the government is not backing away from its obligation, and pensioners can help by being patient in waiting for their pension arrears.\n",
      "“Huwag nating pilitin ang gobyerno na mangutang para ibayad sa inyo. Anyway, dinoble naman ang pension ninyo since 2018, except ‘yung four months—January to April—so palagay ko hindi kayo mahihirapan (Let’s not force the government to borrow money just to pay you. Anyway, your pension was doubled since 2018, except for four months--January to April--so I think you won’t have a hard time),” he said.\n",
      "The Department of Budget and Management had originally proposed PHP172.9 billion under the PGF to partially fund the payment of the 2018 pension differences for MUP.\n",
      "However, in the final version of the 2021 GAA, the amount was reduced to PHP152.9 billion or a difference of PHP20 billion, thus affecting the payment of the 2018 pension differentials.\n",
      "House Committee on Appropriations chair Eric yap said the PHP20 billion was a buffer fund, which the DBM and the legislature all agreed to realign in favor of budget items meant to address the coronavirus pandemic, including the procurement of vaccines and personal protective equipment of medical front-liners.\n",
      "Yap said he would file a PHP50-billion supplemental budget to help absorb the fund deficiency brought about by the PHP70-billion budget cut made by the previous House leadership in the 2020 budget.\n",
      "Deputy Speaker Isidro Ungab also manifested that the 2020 national budget had several realignments, confirming that the PGF was then slashed by PHP74.029 billion by former House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and former Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte.\n",
      "Ungab chaired the House Committee on Appropriations during Cayetano’s term as Speaker.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Anakalusugan Party-list Rep. Mike Defensor disputed Yap’s claim that the PHP20 billion in military and police retirees’ pension money was diverted to Covid-19 vaccine procurement.\n",
      "“To set the record straight, the vaccine procurement fund approved by Congress, as recommended by the bicameral conference committee (bicam) and carried in the 2021 budget, was PHP2.5 billion, which is good for just a few thousand doses and which was the amount recommended by the executive branch at the beginning of the pandemic,” he said.\n",
      "Defensor noted that PHP2.5 billion is the amount that is “sure of funding,” as it is part of the “programmed” portion of the 2021 national budget.\n",
      "He said Congress allocated an additional PHP172 billion but lodged it in the “unprogrammed” part of the outlay, which means it is available only if there is excess revenue, there is a new tax measure as funding source, or there are loans.\n",
      "“Through the bicam, Congress juggled at least PHP182 billion in appropriations recommended by President (Rodrigo) Duterte in his version of the budget. None of that, not even a centavo or peso, was added by the two chambers to the Palace-recommended PHP2.5-billion vaccine procurement fund,” he said. (PNA)\n",

      "MANILA – Private sector employers face administrative penalty if they require their workers to receive coronavirus vaccine before they are allowed to enter the workplace, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) said Wednesday.\n",
      "Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III said it is illegal for companies to require workers to get the vaccine before they are allowed inside working areas.\n",
      "“The possible penalty is administrative penalty. It is not legal for employers to require the employee to be vaccinated before they can enter the workplace,” he said in a virtual forum.\n",
      "“There is no legal basis. So it will be considered as illegal suspension or illegal dismissal. Whatever action the employer will give to the employee who is not yet vaccinated,” the DOLE chief added.\n",
      "Bello is reacting to the statement of a labor group about the emerging mandatory \"no vaccination, no work\" policy being imposed by employers and business owners on employees.\n",
      "Associated Labor Unions national executive vice president Gerard Seno said the group advocates for the vaccination of all workers and pushes for essential workers to be prioritized in the inoculation to safely reopen the economy.\n",
      "\"But these arbitrary actions taken by abusive employers are audacious acts of direct discrimination and straightforward coercion,” Seno said.\n",
      "“Employees, either in private or in government, must never ever be subjected to any compulsion. The decision of any person not to be vaccinated should be respected in the same way we respect those who had taken the vaccine,\" he added.\n",
      "The group said the policy aims to ensure workers’ optimum productivity in the light of government plan to safely and fully open the economy to spur recovery amid the worsening economy caused by the pandemic quarantine restrictions. (PNA)\n",

      "DOH-7 chief pathologist Dr. Mary Jean Loreche said the activity which she personally supervised was designed to prepare the community for the Covid-19 inoculation program.\n",
      "Mayor Junard Chan received a dose of “saline solution” during the mock vaccination procedure.\n",
      "He said he volunteered to lead the dry run “to show to the residents in Lapu-Lapu City that we are ready in case the vaccines arrive”.  \n",
      "“I showed to the people that I presented myself to be the first to receive the vaccine so that they can see that it is safe to be inoculated and they have nothing to worry about. We are happy to know that we can now make ourselves stronger against Covid-19,” Chan told the Philippine News Agency in an interview.\n",
      "The mayor started the simulation by signing an informed consent form before he underwent pre-inoculation screening and taking of vital signs.\n",
      "Loreche, who is also the regional Covid-19 spokesperson, said informed consent is needed before a patient can get the Covid-19 vaccine dose.\n",
      "“Part of the process for the vaccination, there is an informed consent. It is a document whereby the vaccinee, after being counseled, shall sign his/her consent to the vaccination,” she told newsmen.\n",
      "The doctor assigned also conducted a mock interview on Chan, asking him if he had experienced fever, dry cough, headache, cold, sore throat, shortness of breath, chest pain, among other symptoms of Covid-19, in the last 14 days.\n",
      "After getting the \"shot\", the mayor subjected himself to tedious medical preliminaries.\n",
      "In the \"post-inoculation\" interview, Chan was asked if he felt any adverse effects.\n",

      "The DOH-Bicol, according to Ang-Bon, is prepared for any possible reactions or side effects that will be experienced by those who will receive the vaccine.\n",
      "“There are people who are afraid of needles that's why before they were vaccinated they are a little bit scared then after the vaccination they feel relieved that they body reacts, we called it immunization anxiety vaccination reaction,” she said.\n",
      "Ang-Bon reminded those who are hesitant to receive the vaccines that “you must get the right information from the right sources, not from social media. The more we are fearful, the more we are exposed to the virus. Let us be a solution to the problem, the vaccine is our contribution to end the virus.”\n",

      "MANILA – The rollout of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine program is expected to increase chances of further reopening the domestic economy and support bank lending amidst its continued slowdown as of last January due to the pandemic.\n",
      " Data released by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) on Tuesday showed a deeper year-on-year contraction in bank lending, excluding those placed by banks in the central bank’s overnight reverse repurchase (RRP) facility, of -2.4 percent from month-ago’s -0.7 percent. \n",
      " In a report, Rizal Commercial Banking Corporation (RCBC) chief economist Michael Ricafort said the latest bank lending figure for universal and commercial banks (U/KBs) is the weakest in more than 14 years, or since August 2006. \n",
      " Ricafort said this development is “consistent with slower business/economic conditions, in view of the GDP (gross domestic product) contraction of -9.5 percent in 2020 and -8.5 percent in fourth-quarter 2020 largely brought about by the Covid-19 lockdowns/pandemic.” \n",
      " “The latest -2.4 percent contraction in bank loans data (is) also consistent with expectations/estimates of low single-digit year-on-year contraction in 1Q (first quarter) 2021 GDP (partly due to higher base/denominator a year ago, shortly before the Covid-19 pandemic/lockdowns),” he said.\n",
      " Ricafort said bank lending growth “has always been much faster, by about 7-10 percentage points, vis-a-vis GDP growth) for many years/decades.” \n",
      " In the coming months, he said further easing of quarantine restrictions is seen to boost bank lending since this will result in more active economic activities thus, a pick-up in loan demand.\n",
      " “Any pick up in imports, manufacturing, and other business/economic activities would also lead to some pick up in loan demand,” Ricafort said. \n",
      " The low interest rate environment, which is a result of the 200 basis points reduction in BSP’s key policy rates last year, is also projected to entice borrowers to take out loans, he said. \n",
      " He added additional infrastructure spending by the government is also forecast to help lift bank lending since this has higher multiplier effects on the economy. (PNA)\n",

      "“I think the point here is that the amount of work that we will be doing for the contact tracing will be very crucial, especially for those who have been exposed to this South African variant,” he added.\n",
      "Since there are currently only a few cases of the South African variant, he said the government should also “enhance” the vaccine rollout.\n",
      "“For now, it is not yet a concern here in the Philippines because itong mga pumapasok na variants kaunti pa lang (these new variants are still few) and that’s the reason why we really have to enhance the rollout, so that time will come na hindi tayo maabutan din ng maraming variant ng ganitong klase na (we won’t experience many variants that) will also lessen the efficacy of this vaccine,” he added.\n",
      "Earlier, Health Undersecretary Dr. Maria Rosario Vergeire allayed fears that Covid-19 vaccines would offer less protection against the South African variant, saying that while variants might lower the efficacy rate, it still provides protection against severe illness.\n",

      "MANILA – National Task Force Against Covid-19 chief implementer, Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. on Tuesday said the vaccination of local chief executives against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) will start once the country acquires more supply of vaccines.\n",
      "“I hope they understand. Please be patient because yesterday, we had a heated discussion in Malacañang about that and our President has decided to prioritize our healthcare workers first and tell the mayors maybe when we have more vaccines they can start to be vaccinated),” Galvez said in Filipino during the rollout of the vaccination of medical front-liners at the Marikina Sports Complex.\n",
      "This came after Marikina Mayor Marcelino Teodoro, who was also present at the event, said he wanted to be among the first to be inoculated with Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccine but was not allowed to do so by the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID).\n",
      "“Right now, our healthcare workers come first. We plan to finish first the inoculation of 1.7 million health workers nationwide,” Galvez told Teodoro.\n",
      "Galvez explained that once they start vaccinating mayors, all other mayors will have themselves vaccinated too which may compromise the slots for healthcare workers.\n",
      "While he understands the situation, Teodoro said he only wants to get inoculated to allay the fears of his constituents on the safety of the vaccines.\n",
      "“I am 50 years old so by age, I am qualified. Yesterday, based on profiling and medical eligibility, I am qualified to get inoculated and I was also asked about my preferred vaccine. I said I can get inoculated with whatever vaccine is available because it is approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and can already be used,” Teodoro said.\n",
      "Teodoro said convincing the people to get vaccinated remains a challenge as Filipinos are known to be brand conscious even in choosing medicines and vaccines.\n",
      "“The refusal of a healthcare worker to get a vaccine based on brand does not mean that they will be disqualified from getting other available vaccines that will be rolled out,” he noted.\n",
      "He underscored the importance of the vaccine in the fight against Covid-19 and to achieve the goal of returning to normalcy as soon as possible.\n",
      "Four doctors of the ARMMC -- Dr. Emerson U. Chua, Dr. Flordeliza F. Grana, Dr. Alih Bryan T. Catis, and Dr. Rocky R. Dizon -- were among those who were inoculated during the ceremonial rollout of the Covid-19 jabs in the city. (PNA)\n",

      "MANILA – Despite his willingness to get the Sinovac-made CoronaVac vaccine shot, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque on Tuesday explained why only four ranking government officials were allowed to get the jab along with frontline medical workers.\n",
      "In a Palace press briefing, Roque said President Rodrigo Duterte specifically directed Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. and Testing Czar Vince Dizon to subject themselves to inoculation since they are among the faces of the government’s national Covid-19 vaccination program.\n",
      "“Ayaw pa po sana pero talagang si Presidente po nagsabi, at least ang dalawang ito kinakailangan mabakunahan dahil (They didn’t want to go first but the President really said that at least these two need to get vaccinated because) of course we need to walk the talk,” Roque said.\n",
      "At the start of the vaccination program on Monday, Galvez got inoculated at the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) in Manila while Dizon received a vaccine shot at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium in Caloocan City.\n",

      "He did not name the influencers but noted that they were mostly ranking government officials including himself, lawmakers, media personalities, and movie personalities.\n",
      "Roque said he and other members of the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) proposed a list of 50 influencers to get vaccinated to boost public confidence in vaccines. However, the iNITAG rejected their proposal.\n",
      "“Gusto ko talaga magpabakuna, kaya lang po meron tayong tinatawag na iNITAG at tatapatin ko po kayo kami po sa IATF ay nag-propose ng mga singkuwenta na mga bakuna ireserba para sa tinatawag nating influencers nang mapainting natin ang ating vaccine confidence. Hindi po sumang-ayon ang iNITAG. Ako po’y sumusunod naman (I really wanted to get vaccinated, but we have what we call the iNITAG and I will be honest, us at the IATF, we proposed to reserve 50 vaccine doses for influencers to boost vaccine confidence but the iNITAG did not agree),” he said.\n",
      "He said while some vaccinators at the UP-PGH, where the vaccination drive officially commenced, offered to reserve a dose for him, he eventually opted to stick to the priority list.\n",
      "“Bagamat kahapon nagmabuting loob ang PGH ‘kung gusto mo, bibigay na namin sayo.’ At naghanda na po ako. Kaya lang news came to me na talagang matindi yung pagtutol ng iNITAG na magpaturok ang hindi mga medical front-liners so to avoid controversy hindi na po ako nagtuloy (The PGH offered to give me a shot. I prepared for it. But news came to me that the iNITAG was against allowing non-medical front-liners to get vaccinated so to avoid controversy, I didn’t get inoculated,” he added.\n",
      "Roque also noted that the UP-PGH actually ran out of vaccine doses since only around 60-70 individuals had confirmed to subject themselves to vaccination, but 128 people showed up.\n",
      "“Ang totoo naman po naubusan sila kahapon kasi akala nga nila 60 lang, 128 ang nagpabakuna (The truth is they ran out of vaccine doses yesterday because they prepared for 60 people but 128 got vaccinated),” he said.\n",
      "Roque said that a total of 3.4 million Covid-19 vaccine doses will be alloted for 1.7 million healthcare workers in the country.\n",
      "He, however, assured that he would get vaccinated as soon as he would be given the go signal from iNITAG.\n",

      "The Pasig City General Hospital was earlier allocated with 300 doses of Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac for the inoculation of an initial 150 medical personnel.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto, who was present in the event along with National Task Force (NTF) Deputy Chief Implementer Secretary Vince Dizon, said he is willing to have himself vaccinated once he is allowed to do so. \n",
      "\"Kapag panahon ko na po sa 'prioritization guidelines' natin at sabihin ng DOH (Department of Health) na pwede na ko, anytime okay naman ako (When it is my time to be included in the prioritization guidelines and I am told by the DOH that I could get vaccinated, I am okay with that anytime),\" Sotto said when asked if he was willing to have himself vaccinated to help reduce the Filipinos' hesitancy in getting inoculated.\n",
      "He said the confidence level on the Sinovac vaccine \"has no way to go but up\" with the vaccination of Sabarre and other health professionals.\n",
      "Meanwhile, he said the city continues to gear up for the arrival of more Covid-19 vaccines.\n",
      "\"We are talking about the global supply chain here. There are many factors that are beyond our control. Still, we are making the necessary preparations so that once these vaccines arrive anytime, we are ready,\" Sotto said. \n",
      "In a social media post, Sotto reported that 167 hospital-based healthcare professionals in the city have volunteered to get vaccinated.\n",
      "\"Thank you to the national government for the initial 600 doses. Sec. Vince Dizon represented the national government in this morning's Ceremonial Vaccination. Dr. Neri, head of our Covid Referral Center, is the FIRST PASIGUEÑO to be vaccinated,\" he said.\n",
      "While stressing that \"best vaccine is the vaccine that is available\", Sotto said he understands those who are hesitant to get inoculated.\n",

      "MANILA – The chairman of the House of Representatives’ Committee on Appropriations said Tuesday he would file a PHP50-billion supplemental budget to augment the Pension and Gratuity Fund (PGF) for retired uniformed personnel in the 2021 national budget.\n",
      "ACT-CIS Rep. Eric Yap made the statement after Anakalusugan Party-list Rep. Mike Defensor, a known ally of former Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, blamed Speaker Lord Allan Velasco for the decrease in the budget of the 2021 PGF by PHP20 billion during a privilege speech on Monday.\n",
      "Yap noted that there were no irregularities in passing the 2021 General Appropriations Act, saying it was deliberated upon by both the House and the Senate, with consultation with the Executive Branch, particularly the Department of Budget and Management (DBM).\n",
      "He further explained that the PHP20 billion was a buffer fund, which the DBM and the legislature all agreed to realign in favor of budget items meant to address the coronavirus pandemic, including the procurement of vaccines and personal protective equipment of medical front-liners.\n",
      "Yap said the supplemental budget proposal would help absorb the fund deficiency brought about by the PHP70-billion budget cut made by the previous House leadership in the 2020 budget.\n",
      "“The PGF was slashed by the previous House leadership by PHP70-billion,” he said during his interpellation on Monday. “I was puzzled then as to why that was, considering that there was no pandemic yet at that time.”\n",
      "Deputy Speaker Isidro Ungab also manifested that the 2020 national budget had several realignments, confirming that the PGF was then slashed by PHP74.029-billion by Cayetano and former Deputy Speaker Luis Raymund Villafuerte.\n",
      "Ungab chaired the House Committee on Appropriations during Cayetano’s term as Speaker.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Defensor disputed Yap’s claim that the PHP20 billion in military and police retirees’ pension money was diverted to Covid-19 vaccine procurement.\n",
      "“To set the record straight, the vaccine procurement fund approved by Congress, as recommended by the bicameral conference committee (bicam) and carried in the 2021 budget, was PHP2.5 billion, which is good for just a few thousand doses and which was the amount recommended by the executive branch at the beginning of the pandemic,” he said.\n",
      "Defensor noted that PHP2.5 billion is the amount that is “sure of funding,” as it is part of the “programmed” portion of the 2021 national budget.\n",
      "He said Congress allocated an additional PHP172 billion but lodged it in the “unprogrammed” part of the outlay, which means it is available only if there is excess revenue, there is a new tax measure as funding source, or there are loans.\n",
      "“Through the bicam, Congress juggled at least PHP182 billion in appropriations recommended by President Duterte in his version of the budget. None of that, not even a centavo or peso, was added by the two chambers to the Palace-recommended PHP2.5-billion vaccine procurement fund,” he said. (PNA)\n",

      "MANILA – The Quezon City government is ready for its Covid-19 vaccination rollout on Wednesday after receiving the CoronaVac jabs donated by China.\n",
      "“'Yung aming nag-iisang local government-run Covid-19 referral hospital, the Quezon City General Hospital, we already received our allocation kahapon din (For our only local government-run Covid-19 referral hospital, the Quezon City General Hospital, we already received our allocation yesterday),” Belmonte said in an interview with the Philippine News Agency on Tuesday.\n",
      "Medical front-liners will be the first to receive the Sinovac shots based on the directives of the national government and the National Task Force (NTF) Against Covid-19.\n",
      "QC Task Force on Covid-19 chief Joseph Juico said they are targeting to inoculate about 100 medical front-liners on the first day.\n",
      "“A total of 300 doses were delivered to us for the first shots. The next 300 doses will be arriving in time for the second shots. That is, before the 28th day from the first jab,” he said.\n",
      "Belmonte is confident more of the city’s medical front-liners will agree to receive the vaccines, which arrived in the country on Sunday and immediately dispatched to local government units the following day.\n",
      "Initially, just like a few other hospitals in Metro Manila, their medical front-liners were hesitant in receiving vaccines, according to Belmonte.\n",
      "She said this may be due to misinformation, fake news, and demonization about the quality of the China-made vaccines.\n",
      "“Now after we made an effort to conduct town hall meetings wherein all of their concerns were properly addressed and in fact it was shown that when you’re talking about efficacy, it would protect you 100 percent from death, 100 percent from the severity and even from hospitalization, then they were convinced about the Sinovac vaccines,” Belmonte said.\n",
      "The news of St. Luke’s Medical Center Hospital's request for 5,000 doses of Sinovac from the national government, as reported by NTF chief Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. to President Rodrigo Duterte, might influence other medical front-liners to get vaccinated, Belmonte said.\n",
      "“If there’s vaccine confidence among St. Luke’s doctors, who for me are one of the best doctors at least in our city, there’s confidence in Sinovac, then that’s very good news. Hopefully, that would influence other health workers to embrace the vaccine as well,” Belmonte said.\n",
      "If permitted, Belmonte is willing to receive her first shot of the Sinovac vaccine.\n",
      "“No hesitations. None at all,” she said. (PNA)\n",

Cirilito Sobejana, witness the rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination program for troops at the AFP headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City on Tuesday (March 2, 2021). Around 100,000 of the 600,000 doses of Sinovac's CoronaVac jabs are allotted to personnel of the DND, the AFP's mother agency. (Photo courtesy of DND)\n",
      "MANILA – The country's military chief on Tuesday urged troops to show their \"strong resolve of support\" to the government's ongoing vaccination program against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) disease.\n",
      "“As the Chief-of-Staff of the AFP, and in full confidence of our government’s pursuit of promoting the interests of our people; I urge our troops to wholeheartedly support our government’s vaccination program. Let us collectively show our strong resolve of support and trust to this very decisive initiative,” said Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) chief, Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, during the symbolic vaccination of Sinovac Biotech CoronaVac vaccines to medical frontliners assigned at the AFP headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City Tuesday.\n",
      "Aside from Sobejana, also present in the event held at the Tejeros Hall, Commissioned Officers Club, was Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Health Undersecretary Myrna C. Cabotaje along with other senior defense officials.\n",
      "“We in the AFP significantly figure in today’s symbolic vaccination program. We stand alongside our colleagues from the national agencies and local government units in a show of might and resolve in support of the National Vaccine Deployment Program,” he added.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Col. Maria Sheila Jardiolin, a doctor and the commanding officer of Camp General Emilio Aguinaldo Station Hospital, headed the health services personnel in the facility’s vaccination rollout.\n",
      "The priority of the vaccination remains to be the medical health workers who perform anti-Covid-19 operations.\n",
      "Dubbed as “BIDA BAKUNATION” the program seeks to bring immense benefits that the people need in order to restore normalcy in the country. It puts across the important message of protecting and preserving Filipino lives amid the pandemic.\n",
      "The vaccination program also reassures the effectiveness of the vaccine, which is fully backed by expert and professional advice from esteemed health practitioners of the country.\n",
      "Sobejana also extended the AFP's gratitude to the national government and the persevering team that tirelessly worked hard to bring these much-needed vaccines.\n",
      "He said the rollout is the start of many more positive actions from the administration to deliver to the Filipino people.\n",
      "“With the ongoing vaccine distribution and the attendant inoculation of our front-liners, the days ahead certainly look positive. These coming days bode well for all of us for we will certainly rise above the challenge,” Sobejana said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, AFP spokesperson, Marine Maj. Gen. Edgard Arevalo, in a message to reporters, identified three of the medical officers who were vaccinated in the ceremonial inoculation.\n",
      "They are Lt. Col. Jacquelyn Cloma, MC (Medical Corps); Maj. Francis Andrade, MAC (Medical Administrative Corps (MAC) and Maj. Richard Delgado, NC (Nurse Corps).\n",
      "At the Manila Naval Hospital, Arevalo said its commander, Col. Puralyn Epres, led the vaccination of medical workers of the Philippine Navy and Philippine Marines.\n",
      "\"At the Army General Hospital in Fort Bonifacio, Lt. Col. Teresita R Merioles, MC leads the (medical workers) of the Philippine Army,\" he added.\n",
      "At the Philippine Air Force General Hospital, Maj. Irene M. Abutas, MC led the medical workers of the PAF.\n",
      "\"The target today is to vaccinate at least 30 MHWs in each of the hospitals in the four camps named,\" Arevalo said.\n",
      "At the Philippine Army headquarters, its chief Lt. Gen. Jose C. Faustino Jr. received the first dose of CoronaVac vaccines.\n",
      "Faustino, along with vice commander Maj. Gen. Robert C. Dauz, chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Rowen S. Tolentino, and Army General Hospital Executive Officer, Lt. Col. Teresita Merioles got vaccinated in the presence of Department of Health's (DOH) Disease Prevention and Control Bureau Director Dr. Aleli Amie Grace Sudincal, Department of the Interior and Local Government Assistant Secretary Marcelo Morales, and National Task Force against Covid-19 deputy chief implementer, Secretary Vince Dizon.\n",
      "The vaccine will be distributed to 5,000 personnel in the next 15 days and planning for the nationwide vaccination rollout to all units in 18 Army hospitals is ongoing.\n",
      "\"Remember that being inoculated is our duty to the country and to the Filipino people whom we have sworn to serve and protect,\" Faustino told the troops. \"And to our countrymen, please know that the relentless trust and confidence you accord the Army drive us more to continue our efforts to effectively perform our mandate to serve the people and secure the land.\"\n",
      "At the Manila Naval Hospital, Col. Pura Lyn Epres spearheaded the administration of the initial vaccine dosage to 30 Navy hospital and health service front-liners headed by the first vaccinee, acting Chief Surgeon Navy, Col. Reynaldo Capuz who was inoculated by DOH regional director, Dr. Corazon Flores.\n",
      "These individuals who carry out anti-Covid-19 operations were prioritized to receive the limited first batch of available vaccines but the command endeavors to inoculate all its personnel upon the availability of more dosages.\n",
      "Navy chief, Vice Adm. Giovanni Carlo Bacordo said Tuesday's inoculation was “truly monumental for the Philippine Navy because it marks the beginning of the implementation of the government’s national vaccination program in the PN, which is expected to be in full swing in the coming weeks.”\n",
      "“The Philippine Navy is one with the national government and the DOH in protecting and saving Filipino people’s health and lives. We also need this vaccine for us to be able to do our job and we will have them very soon…Little by little, step by step, we can and we will overcome this COVID-19 pandemic together,” Bacordo said.\n",
      "Around 100,000 of the 600,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine donated by the Chinese Ministry of Defense were allotted to the Department of National Defense (DND).\n",
      "The DND will initially inoculate almost 15,000 individuals using close to 30,000 doses while the remaining 70,000 doses will be given to the AFP. (PNA)\n",

      "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, August 15) – Despite Russia’s offer of its Sputnik-V coronavirus vaccine to the Philippines, the Science and Technology Department said discussions are underway with other vaccine manufacturers around the world.\n",
      "DOST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña made the announcement via a Facebook Live broadcast of the DOST Report, an online show created by the same unit producing the agency’s flagship science and technology television program DOSTv.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "“Iba-ibang pathways ang aming dinadaanan dito. Unang-una, andun yung ating mga ineexplore na collaboration agreements for clinical trials with institutions that are leading in the development and coming from countries with bilateral agreements on science and technology, research and development,” dela Peña said.\n",
      "[TRANSLATION: We are using different pathways here. First, there are collaboration agreements we are exploring for clinical trials with institutions…”]\n",
      "Dela Peña said some of the countries their group is having discussions with are China, India, Japan, Canada, and the United States – this is aside from their meetings with Russia, which recently offered their vaccine to the Philippines. Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev reiterated that there is “nothing to hide” about the Sputnik-V coronavirus jab, saying data is available about the vaccine.\n",
      "READ: Russia has nothing to hide about Sputnik V, says envoy\n",
      "Sec. Dela Peña also said clinical trials for Sputnik-V will commence in October and may end by May of 2021 – same as the earliest date Malacañang announced earlier this week about how soon President Rodrigo Duterte can get vaccinated with the Gamaleya Institute-made vaccine.\n",
      "“Mahaba-habang proseso dahil iaanalyze pa ng experts dito yung data na ibinibigay nila bago tayong magsimula ng clinical trials,” Dela Peña said.\n",
      "[TRANSLATION: This will be a long process because experts will analyze the data they (Russia) will give before we start clinical trials.]\n",
      "The secretary also said the vaccine will have to be approved by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration or FDA before it can be used.\n",
      "In the meantime, the DOST is also waiting on the final list of vaccines from the World Health Organization which would be used for trials in the Philippines.\n",
      "Six vaccines from China, the US, and the UK are currently in the third stage of clinical trials.\n",
      "Dela Peña said three hospitals have been eyed for vaccine trials: the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and Manila Doctor’s Hospital – both in the nation’s capital, and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, also the Philippines’ premier coronavirus testing facility.\n",
      "Discussions with other COVID vaccine manufacturers ongoing – DOST\n",

      "Aug 15, 2020 12:30:24 AM\n",
      "(CNN) — On a day his state and others reported staggering coronavirus numbers, one Midwestern governor said he could see through the darkness to better days ahead. But he acknowledged it will remain a difficult journey.\n",
      "Moderna hours before had announced its Covid-19 vaccine has an astonishingly high success rate -- 94.5% effective -- based on interim clinical trial data. It is the second company to report such high efficacy results.\n",
      "\"There is light at the end of the tunnel,\" Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz told reporters Monday of the vaccine news. \"But I want to be very clear. We need to get all our neighbors to the end of the tunnel.\"\n",
      "That tunnel is going to be a long one.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "Most Americans probably won't get vaccinated until next year. And the fall surge continues to bring a terrifying jump in cases across the US: For the 11th day in a row, Illinois reported more than 10,000 cases in a single day, according to the state Department of Health website. Nationwide, for two straight weeks, the US has added more than 100,000 new cases daily.\n",
      "Cases in California are up 51.3% in the past week and daily cases have doubled in just 10 days, Gov. Gavin Newsom said. About 70% of the counties in the state are moving back into more restrictive tiers as Newsom used the analogy of \"pulling an emergency brake\" to deal with the crisis.\n",
      "As vaccination trials continue, tens of thousands of lives could either be saved or lost, depending on how people act. Traditional Thanksgiving gatherings, for example, are a huge concern among health experts and state leaders.\n",
      "\"We simply can't do that right now,\" Walz said as his state reported 24,000 new cases in just three days.\n",
      "All of this comes as one expert says Covid-19 could become the leading daily cause of death in the US.\n",
      "\"It's more than just heading in the wrong direction,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of tropical medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine. \"We are on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.\"\n",
      "Why the 'war' against Covid-19 is getting worse\n",
      "Much of the current surge is fueled by people hanging out with friends or family who don't live with them -- and wrongfully assuming they're not infected.\n",
      "US Surgeon General Jerome Adams said all Americans must mask up and double down on safety precautions, including social distancing, as the next few months are expected to be the worst of the pandemic.\n",
      "\"Hard truths: 49/50 states with increasing cases, 34 in red or orange zones (ie significant rise),\" Adams tweeted.\n",
      "\"Record cases over the past week will be record hospitalizations soon. Our/ YOUR communities and hospitals simply can not sustain high level care at this rate of increase.\"\n",
      "Many hospitals are already running out of health care staff. Major surgeries for non-Covid patients are getting delayed. And some patients are several hours away from the closest available ICU bed.\n",
      "Nationwide, more than 11 million people in the US have been infected with coronavirus, and more than 247,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n",
      "If 95% of Americans wore masks consistently, 68,000 lives could be saved by March 1, according to the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n",
      "If not, the death toll is expected to reach 439,000 by March 1.\n",
      "The hospitalization record is shattered, again\n",
      "A record-high 69,864 Covid-19 patients were hospitalized Sunday, according to the Covid Tracking Project.\n",
      "That number far exceeds the spring peak of 59,940, on April 15, and the summer peak of 59,718 on July 23.\n",
      "Hospitalizations will likely keep rising as new infections keep soaring. And the increased case numbers aren't just due to more testing.\n",
      "The US has averaged 148,725 new Covid-19 cases per day over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins. That's a 31% increase in new cases from the previous week.\n",
      "But the number of new Covid-19 tests performed has increased only 10.42%, according to the Covid Tracking Project.\n",
      "Bipartisan officials enact new restrictions\n",
      "A growing number of Republican and Democratic governors and city leaders have issued new mandates to try to stop the crisis from getting worse.\n",
      "On Monday, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio announced new limits on social gatherings, weddings and funerals.\n",
      "\"Despite the health order that limited mass gatherings to 10 people that was signed in April remaining in effect, we have seen rampant spread of the virus as a result of banquets, wedding receptions, and social gatherings following funerals,\" the governor said.\n",
      "\"We have seen great tragedy associated with such events. It's not the ceremonies causing the problem. It's the party afterward.\"\n",
      "The revised order prohibits dancing or socializing in open, congregate areas. Guests must be seated, and food should be served to them at their seats. No more than 10 people can sit at a table, and those people must be from the same household.\n",
      "Philadelphia announced new outdoor restrictions. As a result, the Eagles will not be able to host fans at Lincoln Financial Field, the NFL team said in a tweet.\n",
      "Starting Thursday, all bars and restaurants in Oklahoma must close by 11 p.m. and restaurant tables must be 6 feet apart.\n",
      "\"We need to slow the spread of this virus,\" said Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt. \"Data shows that social distancing is harder to maintain as it gets later at night, especially in bars.\"\n",
      "Beginning Tuesday, state employees must wear masks in common areas or when they are close to other workers, Stitt said.\n",
      "Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, has banned indoor social gatherings with people from different households, unless they take appropriate precautions.\n",
      "Those precautions include everyone quarantining for 14 days before the gathering, or quarantining for seven days before the gathering and getting a negative Covid-19 test result no more than 48 hours beforehand.\n",
      "Outdoor gatherings will be limited to five people in Washington state, and restaurants and bars will be limited to outdoor service with capacity limits and to-go service. Stores, including grocery stores, are limited to 25% capacity.\n",
      "In Michigan, high schools and colleges will shift to remote learning for three weeks. Indoor restaurant dining has been suspended.\n",
      "In Oregon, Democratic Gov. Kate Brown announced a two-week \"social freeze,\" which includes limiting social gatherings, suspending indoor restaurant dining, and limiting the number of people who can gather for faith-based organizations.\n",
      "And Republican Govs. Doug Burgum of North Dakota and Gary Herbert of Utah are among the latest to mandate face masks across their states.\n",
      "\"Right now, the data demands a higher level of mitigation efforts to reverse this dangerous trends, to slow the spread of the virus, and to avoid the need for any economic shutdowns,\" Burgum said.\n",
      "Former FDA heads under Trump and Bush call for mask mandates\n",
      "Health experts have lamented the lack of a strong, coordinated federal response to this pandemic. So it's \"now up to governors\" to enact tough restrictions to get Covid-19 outbreaks under control, two former commissioners of the Food and Drug Administration wrote.\n",
      "\"At least while infections are widespread and surging, governors and local leaders should mandate the use of masks and impose clear and consistent plans to restrict gatherings,\" Dr. Scott Gottlieb and Dr. Mark McClellan wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.\n",
      "\"Americans are understandably tired of Covid, but accepting temporary restrictions now will help prevent even more painful personal and economic disruptions.\"\n",
      "Gottlieb worked in the Trump administration, and McClellan worked in the George W. Bush administration.\n",
      "Many governors have taken aggressive steps to slow the spread,\" they wrote, \"but states that don't act quickly put the entire nation at risk.\"\n",
      "'This winter will be hard'\n",
      "Yes, there's great news with two vaccine trials -- one from Moderna, and one from Pfizer/BioNTech.\n",
      "But let's be clear: There will be no return to normal this year, BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin said.\n",
      "\"This winter will be hard. We will not have a big impact on the infection numbers with our vaccine this winter,\" Sahin told the BBC.\n",
      "Last week, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said \"we believe that we are in good situation to have up to 50 million doses this year, globally, and I believe we are in a very, very good situation to have 1.3 billion doses globally next year.\"\n",
      "But just like the Moderna vaccine, the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses for each person.\n",
      "So if 50 million doses are available worldwide by the end of this year, that would mean 25 million people could get vaccinated.\n",
      "Moderna, Pfizer and other companies making vaccines must first ask for and then receive emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration before they can start distributing their vaccines.\n",
      "This story was first published on CNN.com 'Good news on the vaccine front shows 'light at the end of the tunnel.' For now, the Covid crisis is unabated'\n",

      "(CNN) — Being vaccinated against Covid-19 is morally acceptable, the Vatican deemed, after some anti-abortion groups raised concerns about how the vaccines were manufactured.\n",
      "Some groups had suggested the coronavirus vaccines were made using cells from aborted fetuses. The cells are actually engineered and grown in labs from tissue acquired many decades ago, and are not made directly from aborted fetuses.\n",
      "The Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said in a note approved by Pope Francis on Monday that receiving the shot was morally permitted.\n",
      "\"It is morally acceptable to receive Covid-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process,\" the note said.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "The statement was issued and signed by the head of the Congregation in response to several requests for guidelines regarding the use of the vaccine.\n",
      "There have been some disagreements within the clergy regarding the ethics of taking a Covid-19 vaccine because it had used tissue retrieved from two abortions that took place in the last century.\n",
      "The abortion connection, which had prompted a number of Bishops to voice their opposition to the vaccine, has now been rejected by the Vatican and by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops had already issued a statement earlier in the month stating that the use of Covid-19 vaccines is morally justified.\n",
      "\"Given the urgency of this crisis, the lack of available alternative vaccines, and the fact that the connection between an abortion that occurred decades ago and receiving a vaccine produced today is remote, inoculation with the new COVID-19 vaccines in these circumstances can be morally justified\".\n",
      "The statement adds that receiving the vaccines do not indicate a cooperation with abortion, and that is not to be considered as an endorsement in any way.\n",
      "\"The licit use of such vaccines does not and should not in any way imply that there is a moral endorsement of the use of cell lines proceeding from aborted foetuses\".\n",
      "The Vatican's statement is aimed at addressing the moral questions surrounding the vaccine and does not aim to judge the safety or effectiveness.\n",
      "The statement also called on the governments, pharmaceutical companies, and international organisations to pay extra attention to the equitable distribution of the vaccine to the poorer countries.\n",
      "\"There is also a moral imperative for the pharmaceutical industry, governments and international organizations to ensure that vaccines, which are effective and safe from a medical point of view, as well as ethically acceptable, are also accessible to the poorest countries in a manner that is not costly for them,\" it said.\n",

      "In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, Bourla said he first learned about the results of the trial Sunday and he has yet to see the data, throwing cold water on the idea that there was any political motivation behind releasing the news after voters in the United States chose their candidate for president.\n",
      "Pfizer took several interim looks at the data during its vaccine trial, but it did not have enough infections in its test group to gain any meaningful data — until Sunday, Gupta reported. If anything, the data came earlier than expected: In October, Bourla made a comment  in an open letter on Pfizer's website, saying, \"Based on our current trial enrollment and dosing pace, we estimate we will reach this milestone in the third week of November.\"\n",
      "The Trump administration was quick to take credit for Pfizer's promising news. US Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that Pfizer's development was \"thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President Donald Trump.\"\n",

      "\"As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn't have the courage to do it before,\" Trump tweeted Monday evening. \"Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives!\" he tweeted.\n",

The race shows no signs of slowing as companies continue to move their vaccine candidates through clinical trials, growing closer to determining which will be considered safe and effective.\n",

      "Vaccinations are set to begin on Tuesday in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland said it would start administering the vaccine early in the week but did not specify which day.\n",
      "The process, which is complicated by the need to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine under strict conditions and give each recipient two doses, three weeks apart, will be closely watched from around the world.\n",
      "Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that 50 hospital hubs across England had already received their allocation of the vaccine, and that the distribution of the vaccine was \"really well underway now.\"\n",
      "UK health officials expect to have up to 4 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, available by the end of December, Cordery said.\n",
      "The government has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine so far, enough to vaccinate 20 million people, or a third of the UK population. More deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded in the UK than anywhere else in Europe.\n",
      "The speed with which UK regulators approved the vaccine -- ahead of their counterparts elsewhere in Europe and in the United States -- raised questions in some quarters. But Cordery said the process had been \"incredibly robust.\"\n",

      "The UK government's announcement of its approval a day earlier had been followed by confusion over who would get the vaccine first and how it could be administered safely, given the logistical constraints.\n",
      "The vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, a temperature only possible in special freezers. Once taken out of the freezer, the MHRA authorization requires the doses to be kept refrigerated and used within 5 days. Batches can only be moved and repacked into smaller numbers of doses a limited number of times and under strict conditions. Once a vial is diluted for injection, it cannot be transported and must be used within six hours, or discarded.\n",

      "But the challenges involved in getting the vaccine to care home residents means health workers now plan to administer it first to people aged over 80 who are about to be discharged from hospital, or are attending out-patient hospital appointments.\n",
      "\"Hospitals will also begin inviting over 80s in for a jab and work with care home providers to book their staff in to vaccination clinics,\" a statement from NHS England said Sunday. \"Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from Covid.\"\n",

      "(CNN) -- Even before the pandemic hit, the Cherokee Nation was dealing with a crisis: the potential disappearance of its native language.\n",
      "Only about 2,000 people alive on this earth can speak the Cherokee language fluently. And as Covid-19 began to spread, that number started to dwindle.\n",
      "So when the Cherokee Nation began receiving shipments of the Covid-19 vaccine, the tribal government identified Cherokee speakers as among the first groups to be eligible for the shot.\n",
      "\"When you lose a speaker and you're a tribe that has only 2,000 fluent speakers left, you've lost something that isn't just irreplaceable, as all life is, but is really a national treasure,\" Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. told CNN. \"Whether they survive and whether they pass down their knowledge will help determine in a couple of generations if there is a Cherokee language left.\"\n",
      "Vaccinating Cherokee language speakers alongside frontline health care workers is just the latest effort the tribe has made during the pandemic to keep this treasured population safe.\n",
      "And in doing so, the Cherokee Nation is not only protecting some of most revered citizens, but also ensuring the survival of its culture and identity.\n",
      "About 30 Cherokee speakers have died of Covid-19\n",
      "In relative terms, the Cherokee Nation has fared much better than other tribes and many parts of the US in controlling the spread of the virus.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "The Cherokee Nation, with about 141,000 citizens living on its reservation in northeastern Oklahoma, has reported a total of more than 11,800 Covid-19 cases and 66 deaths as of January 8. But about 30 of the people lost were native Cherokee speakers, Hoskin said.\n",
      "\"When I took office, preserving our language and revitalizing it was a high priority,\" he said. \"In the midst of Covid, knowing what we're losing, it just tells me that that's the right priority and we need to emphasize it even more.\"\n",
      "The first 975 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine arrived in the Cherokee Nation on December 14. The next morning, the tribe started vaccinating frontline health care workers at its health complex in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.\n",
      "Three days later, the tribe began administering the shot to Cherokee language speakers.\n",
      "The Cherokee Nation already had a record of its living first language speakers, thanks to an effort Hoskin initiated in 2018 when he was the tribe's Secretary of State. So its staff started contacting those listed in the speaker roll book to let them know they could now schedule an appointment to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\n",
      "More than 600 speakers have been vaccinated so far, according to the tribe. The aim is to vaccinate 1,000 by the end of the week.\n",
      "On January 4, the Cherokee Nation also announced it was beginning vaccinations for elders aged 65 and older.\n",
      "Prioritizing the vaccination of Cherokee speakers and elders has also had an unintended consequence: It has built trust in the vaccine among other citizens of the Cherokee Nation.\n",
      "Hoskin said he's seen some hesitation among Cherokee Nation citizens about taking the vaccine. But the tribe's decision to vaccinate native speakers early helped ease the anxieties that some people might have otherwise had, he added.\n",
      "\"People revere elders in the Cherokee Nation,\" he said. \"I think when they saw that group of people being made a high priority and celebrating it, that surely has built some confidence.\"\n",

      "(CNN) -- A leading Chinese Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech was just 50.38% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil, significantly lower than earlier results showed, according to a statement published by the government of Sao Paulo Tuesday.\n",
      "While the number exceeds the threshold required for regulatory approval, it falls far below the 78% previously announced, raising questions as to the veracity of the data and fueling skepticism over the apparent lack of transparency regarding Chinese vaccines.\n",
      "Analysts said the efficacy rate of Sinovac's Coronavac vaccine in Brazil -- the lowest among its global competitors -- could affect international confidence in Chinese-made vaccines and hamper Beijing's effort to repair its image from its early mishandling of the initial outbreak by providing Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries.\n",
      "\"The Butantan Institute and the Government of Sao Paulo report that the coronavirus vaccine achieved a 50.38% overall efficacy rate in the clinical study conducted in Brazil, in addition to (an efficacy rate of) 78% for mild cases and 100% for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19. All rates are higher than the 50% level required by the WHO (World Health Organization),\" the statement released Tuesday said.\n",
      "The razor-thin margin for regulatory approval is likely to lead to concern among scientists, given that last week the Butantan institute released partial \"clinical efficacy\" results celebrating 78% to 100% efficacy in preventing infections.\n",
      "The state body financed the phase 3 trials of the vaccine, which involved 13,000 health workers across eight Brazilian states.\n",
      "\"Regarding the overall efficacy of the analysis, we met the requirements of the World Health Organization with 50.38%,\" Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at the Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo said Tuesday during a news conference.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "However, on Tuesday, high-ranking members of the Brazilian Health Ministry told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil that \"the effectiveness is borderline,\" and that because \"It is at the limit. We have to wait for ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) to evaluate.\"\n",
      "A representative of Sinovac said the company is discussing the result but declined to give further comment. The final efficacy rate of the vaccine will be determined by China's drug regulator, the National Medical Production Administration, according to the representative.\n",
      "Potential stumbling block\n",
      "Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the US based Council on Foreign Relations, described the 50.38% efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine as a \"disappointing\" result that had caught him by surprise.\n",
      "The results suggest Coronavac is less effective than alternative vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have an efficacy rate of about 95%.\n",
      "Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 91% effective, while the UK's vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has an average efficacy of 70%.\n",
      "The Sinovac vaccine is also less effective than its domestic Chinese competitor, developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, which it says is 79.34% effective.\n",
      "Despite the worse than anticipated results, Huang said the Sinovac vaccine would still be \"usable\" by helping to relieve pressures on healthcare systems while reducing potential deaths, given its higher efficacy for moderate and severe cases that would require medical treatment.\n",
      "However, its low overall efficacy could hinder Sinovac's ability to expand its market share globally, Huang said.\n",
      "Sinovac has signed deals to provide 46 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to Brazil, 50 million doses to Turkey and 7.5 million doses to Hong Kong. It'll also supply 40 million doses of vaccine bulk -- the vaccine concentrate before it is divided into vials -- to Indonesia for local production.\n",
      "\"Since many countries are planning to order, or have already ordered Sinovac's vaccines, it might undermine people's willingness to take them, because people may question the usefulness of the vaccines,\" Huang said. \"It could be a potential stumbling block.\"\n",
      "Lack of transparency\n",
      "A lack of transparency has been a major concern clouding Chinese-made vaccines, which Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to make \"a global public good.\"\n",
      "Both Sinovac and Sinopharm have faced questions regarding the release of data. When announcing its efficacy results, state-owned Sinopharm did not provide details on its clinical trial data. A Sinopharm executive said detailed data would be released later and published in scientific journals, without giving a timeline.\n",
      "There is also the issue of discrepancy in results from clinical trials conducted in different places.\n",
      "Having largely eliminated the coronavirus inside its borders earlier last year, Chinese drugmakers had to look abroad for places to test the efficacy of their vaccines. But the results reported so far are far from consistent.\n",
      "Sinopharm's efficacy rate of 79%, for example, is lower than the 86% announced by the United Arab Emirates for the same vaccine in December.\n",
      "Sinovac's vaccine has had wildly different results from three countries: Indonesian drug regulators say interim data from Phase 3 trials showed it is 65.3% effective and gave it the country's first emergency use approval; Turkey says it is 91.25% effective; And in Brazil, the two significantly different efficacy rates announced a week apart have further sparked questions.\n",
      "Last week, Brazil's health regulator agency ANVISA told the Butantan Institute that in order to approve the emergency use of a vaccine, the global efficacy rate had to be made publicly available -- information the Institute had not received at the time from Sinovac, according to CNN Brasil sources.\n",
      "ANVISA will meet on Sunday to decide on two requests for emergency use of both the Coronavac vaccine and the Oxford University AstraZeneca vaccine.\n",
      "Domestic expectations\n",
      "The news could potentially hinder China's own coronavirus vaccination drive too, Huang warned.\n",
      "China has inoculated tens of thousands of people with Sinovac's vaccine since July under a government-approved emergency use program, which includes at least three Chinese vaccine candidates.\n",
      "In total, it has administered 4.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine under emergency use, and is planning to vaccinate 50 million people ahead of February's Lunar New Year celebrations.\n",
      "Chinese public health experts have repeatedly told the public they are confident that Chinese-made vaccines are at least as good as, if not better, than foreign alternatives, Huang said.\n",
      "\"If people learn about this, they might start to question the safety and efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine, or even other Chinese-made vaccines,\" Huang said. \"I think the government will need to do some convincing work, on either those who have already taken the shots, or are about to do so.\"\n",

      "(CNN) -- Are COVID-19 vaccines safe for cancer patients?\n",
      "It's a question that has been on the minds of researchers and oncologists long before the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine rollouts began. Although there is a consensus that the vaccines are safe for most cancer patients, according to the American Cancer Society and others in the medical community, research into whether they will be effective for cancer patients is still a data-free zone.\n",
      "The American Cancer Society recommends that cancer patients talk to their doctors before getting any type of vaccine because all patients and their courses of treatment are different.\n",
      "There are several factors that may require a cancer patient to delay vaccination, including recent stem cell transplants or other recent use of therapy agents known to reduce vaccine efficacy, according to Dr. Laura Makaroff, the American Cancer Society's Senior Vice President for Prevention and Early Detection.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "\"As far as safety of the vaccine, every situation for every patient with cancer is a little different. And there's a spectrum of where any one patient might be in their cancer journey,\" Makaroff told CNN. \"The COVID-19 vaccine is definitely safe for people with cancer but it's important that patients have a conversation with their healthcare provider and their cancer care team to determine when is the right time to have the vaccine.\"\n",
      "\"All the guidance that we're seeing -- the American Cancer society and other leading oncology groups -- is that COVID-19 immunization is recommended for patients in active therapy, but we really understand that there are limited safety and efficacy data on these patients,\" Makaroff said.\n",
      "Even with limited data, many cancer experts, medical groups, and doctors are making a big push for vaccinating most cancer patients -- especially those cancer patients most at risk during the pandemic.\n",
      "\"The potential benefits far outweigh the risks,\" said Dr. Brian Koffman, chief medical officer for the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Society, a group that represents patients with the most common adult form of leukemia in the western world.\n",
      "\"Despite the lack of safety data specifically in patients with CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), SARS-Cov-2 vaccination is anticipated to be safe.\"\n",
      "Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who develop symptomatic COVID-19 have an 89% risk of hospitalization, Koffman told CNN, based on a study published in the journal Nature.\n",
      "CLL is characterized by a weakened immune system. The immunocompromization is so severe that CLL patients are advised to avoid live vaccines such as the ones for measles or yellow fever.\n",
      "And a weakened immune system also means these cancer patients have an increased risk of death due to Covid-19, according to Dr. Chaitra Ujjani, a physician at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and oncology professor at the University of Washington School of Medicine. The Nature study, conducted the by European Research Initiative on CLL, found that the mortality rate for CLL patients with symptomatic coronavirus was 31%.\n",
      "\"The thing that people don't quite realize is that the impaired immune system in CLL patients -- due to the disease or some of the treatments for the disease -- can actually impact your response to vaccination,\" Ujjani told CNN.\n",
      "\"We recommend the COVID-19 vaccines for our patients ... but we're not really sure how effective it's going to be,\" she added. \"Patients with blood cancers are typically excluded from the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of the vaccine.\"\n",
      "Cancer-specific vaccine trials underway\n",
      "To remedy the lack of data, Ujjani is launching a research study involving 500 CLL patients across the country -- all of whom are already slated to receive the vaccine from their doctor or pharmacist -- to determine what kind of immune response they will have to the commercially available vaccines.\n",
      "The study, which is a collaboration between more than 10 medical institutions, will be the first of its kind and may bring more clarity for cancer patients.\n",
      "The Seattle Cancer Care Alliance is conducting similar trials for other cancer types, including certain immune system and blood cancers, Ujjani said.\n",
      "Advocacy groups for other more prevalent types of cancer are also encouraging cancer patients to get vaccinated as soon as possible. The Lung Cancer Action Network recently asked the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to give lung cancer patients expedited access to the vaccines.\n",
      "\"Because COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory condition, this disease presents a unique challenge to lung cancer patients, who are at extremely high risk of hospitalization and death from COVID-19,\" said the group in a letter.\n",
      "More research urgently needed\n",
      "The scientific community agrees that more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines in cancer patients -- and many doctors are working around the clock to get more trials off the ground.\n",
      "\"We need these data so that we can better inform patients and better prioritize the allocation of the vaccines. If these vulnerable patients form an adequate immune response, we should certainly vaccinate them as early as possible,\" Dr. Elad Sharon, senior investigator at the National Cancer Institute, told CNN via email.\n",
      "\"But, if research efforts show that these patients fail to form a protective response to these vaccines, then what we will need to do will be to vaccinate everyone around these patients first, so that our medically vulnerable patients are most protected by the people living with them and caring for them.\"\n",
      "Ujjani added, \"We're all working really hard to answer this question, but it's hard because we've been working kind of against the clock as the vaccines just became available.\"\n",
      "\"A lot of our patients have suffered in isolation and fear, and they're not sure they're going to get back to a normal life,\" Ujjani told CNN. \"So every oncologist is interested to see how their patients will respond to the vaccine.\"\n",

      "(CNN) -- When she found a lump in her left breast during a routine self-check, Boston primary care physician Dr. Devon Quasha knew exactly what to do. She immediately scheduled a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound at Massachusetts General Hospital for early January.\n",
      "Then the Moderna vaccine became available to health care professionals in the city. She received her first COVID-19 shot about a week before her scheduled mammogram.\n",
      "Quasha didn't notice much of a reaction to the vaccine at first, but a couple of days before her appointment her left arm began to hurt.\n",
      "Tender, swollen lumps developed under her left armpit, along with a large swelling above her collarbone -- all areas where the body has lymph nodes, the body's filters for germs.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "\"You have lymph nodes above and below your collarbone,\" Quasha said. \"You don't want to feel those. It was scary when I felt it.\"\n",
      "Lymph nodes contain immune cells that help fight invaders. That's why it made sense to Quasha that the nodes were reacting to the vaccine, building antibodies as they were designed to do. But she couldn't be sure.\n",
      "The swelling was only on the left side where she had gotten the shot -- the same side as the worrisome lump. Was it a reaction to the vaccine or another sign of breast cancer?\n",
      "'It was like a wildfire'\n",
      "After the ultrasound, Quasha's radiologist was concerned. She told Quasha she considered the lump she had felt in her breast to be of little significance, but the lymph nodes that showed up as white blobs on her mammogram were another matter.\n",
      "In non-pandemic times, that finding would set off alarm bells, requiring the need for further investigation, even an immediate biopsy. Yet Quasha had just had the vaccine. After talking it over with her, Quasha said her doctor decided not to do a biopsy at that time. Instead she told Quasha to come back for a follow-up ultrasound in six weeks.\n",
      "Similar scenarios had been happening in mammogram centers around the country. As radiologists compared notes with colleagues, word began to spread.\n",
      "\"We all started talking about it, and it was like a wildfire,\" said Dr. Connie Lehman, chief of breast imaging in Massachusetts General's department of radiology.\n",
      "\"I cannot tell you how many women are showing nodes on mammograms and people thought it was going to be not that common,\" said Lehman, who is also a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School.\n",
      "Tales of unnecessary biopsies spurred the patient care committee of the Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) to put out an advisory in January: Ask your patients about their COVID-19 status, and record the date and which arm received the vaccine. Consider that before automatically scheduling a biopsy.\n",
      "\"We wanted to advocate that women don't always need to have a biopsy,\" said Dr. Lars Grimm, associate professor of radiology at Duke University School of Medicine and one of the authors of the SBI advisory. \"Because oftentimes the default if you see swollen lymph nodes in a patient would actually be to recommend doing a biopsy.\"\n",
      "Mass General's Lehman agreed. \"When you hear hoofbeats, don't think zebra,\" she said. \"If a woman had a vaccine in the arm on the same side, and the lymph nodes are swollen, this is a normal biological response. It's totally expected. It just doesn't make sense to start imaging.\"\n",
      "That does not mean that women who wish to be sure about their cancer status cannot have a biopsy, Grimm stressed.\n",
      "\"You actually have some women who want to biopsy,\" he said. \"You might tell them, 'Hey, I think this is due to your Covid vaccine, and I'm sure that it's going to resolve in a few weeks on its own and you're going to be fine.' But that patient tells you, 'I'm not going to be comfortable waiting, I want to know now.' \"\n",
      "Focus on screening to save lives\n",
      "For Quasha, the knowledge that many women were experiencing the same type of reaction to the vaccine was a welcome relief from worry. After a discussion with her doctor, she said she no longer needs the follow-up screening.\n",
      "\"I was very reassured,\" Quasha said. \"The point here is that there are a number of side effects from the vaccine which are not dangerous but can sometimes increase patient anxiety.\"\n",
      "Instead of bringing women back in for an unnecessary ultrasound, radiology centers should be focused on scheduling women who have missed or are overdue on their mammogram, Lehman said.\n",
      "\"We need to take care of the large percentage of women who didn't get screened because of the shutdowns during Covid,\" she said. \"At Mass General alone, we failed to screen 15,000 women because of Covid, and we're still trying to get them back in.\n",
      "\"This isn't where I need to start doing axillary ultrasounds, because someone had a vaccine and the node swelled. It's just not being practical or pragmatic or putting our patient's needs first,\" she said.\n",
      "It's not just breast cancer, Lehman stressed. Lymph nodes in other parts of the body are also reacting to the COVID-19 vaccines, causing people with other forms of cancer to undergo unnecessary procedures.\n",
      "\"There have been some false scares and some unnecessary biopsies because people didn't think to ask, and they assume that the node was the cancer coming back,\" she said.\n",
      "What to do?\n",
      "To avoid unnecessary worry, SBI recommends women schedule any routine, annual breast screening before getting the COVID-19 vaccine. If a woman has already had the vaccine, or is soon scheduled to do so, the society suggests waiting at least four to six weeks after the second dose before scheduling your appointment.\n",
      "At Mass General, Lehman and her team have gone a step further. They are screening all women regardless of vaccine status, but telling those with no history of cancer that any swelling in the lymph nodes that might be connected to a COVID-19 vaccine is benign -- meaning not cancerous.\n",
      "\"This follows the American College of Radiology recommendations that if you have a known inflammatory cause you can say it's benign,\" said Lehman, who recently published a paper on the hospital's procedures.\n",
      "\"If their concern is a swelling or tenderness after the vaccine in their armpit, we suggest that they wait four to six weeks, talk to their doctor, and if it persists, then we have them come in to do an evaluation of it,\" she said.\n",
      "Whatever you do, experts stress, don't skip getting your breast cancer screening when it is recommended. A study published Tuesday in the journal Radiology that followed over half a million women made the point clearly: Women who skip even one scheduled mammography screening before they are diagnosed with breast cancer have a significantly higher risk of dying.\n",
      "In fact, the risk of having a fatal breast cancer within 10 years of diagnosis was 50% lower for women who had regular breast screenings, the study said.\n",

      "While details about the research behind the vaccine are limited, here's what we know so far.\n",
      "What do we know about the Russian vaccine?\n",
      "The vaccine was developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, using funding from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). The vaccine is named Sputnik V -- a reference to the 1957 Soviet Union satellite.\n",
      "Scientists conducted months of human trials but are yet to publish data and did not begin the crucial Phase 3 stage, which usually precedes approval, before the announcement on Tuesday.\n",
      "On Wednesday it was announced that a Phase 3 trial involving more than 2,000 people in Russia and several Middle Eastern and Latin American countries had begun. Typically this stage of trial involves testing on tens of thousands of people.\n",
      "Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said Tuesday that the number of people the vaccine had been tested on so far was the equivalent of a Phase 1 trial, which typically involves a small group and studies the safety of the vaccine.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "Is the Russian vaccine safe?\n",
      "The short answer is that we don't know. Russia has released no scientific data on its vaccine testing and CNN is unable to verify claims about its safety or effectiveness. But Russia says the vaccine has passed through Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials which were completed on August 1.\n",
      "A Phase 1 study typically focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and whether it elicits an immune response in a small number of people.\n",
      "\"We do not have any information whatsoever on whether this is safe,\" Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University of Nottingham, told CNN.\n",
      "Russia claims that volunteers in the Phase 1 and 2 trials felt well after taking the vaccine, and exhibited no unforeseen or unwanted side effects.\n",
      "Neal said that researchers were unlikely to have detected any rare side effects linked to the Gamaleya vaccine.\n",
      "\"You won't know about side effects without [widespread] testing, if they're rare. That's the point of a Phase 3 study,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I wouldn't take it, certainly not outside of a clinical trial right now,\" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.\n",
      "Is the vaccine effective?\n",
      "Without data and completed Phase 3 trials, Russia has not proven to the world Sputnik V works.\n",
      "\"I would think that it at least produces antibodies. What we don't know is if it protects people against infection,\" Neal told CNN.\n",
      "Russia has said that its vaccine is an adenoviral vector one. Adenoviruses cause the common cold, but in Covid-19 vaccines they're weakened and modified to deliver genetic material that codes for a protein from the novel coronavirus.\n",
      "The body then produces that protein and may produce an immune response against it but the method can cause problems.\n",
      "Sputnik V's makers say the vaccine induced a \"strong antibody and cellular immune response,\" in trial volunteers, according to the official website for the vaccine.\n",

      "How did Russia pull this off so quickly?\n",
      "In April, Russia enacted a law which eliminated the need for a Phase 3 vaccine trial before approval.\n",
      "Approval now means the coronavirus vaccine can be distributed even as Phase 3 tests get underway -- though practically speaking, mass-manufactured doses aren't expected to be ready for weeks.\n",
      "\"They're not as far ahead as other vaccines,\" Neal said, noting that Moderna and Oxford's vaccines have already begun Phase 3 trials.\n",

But he added that these are not normal times, with a pandemic raging and shortage of vaccines.\n",
      "Pfizer and Moderna both use genetic technology called messenger RNA, or mRNA technology. Johnson & Johnson uses a weakened common cold virus, known as adenovirus, to carry genetic instructions into the body to prompt an immune response.\n",

      "Plus no cases of severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis were seen in any of the volunteers, the company said.\n",
      "Fauci said the results would look even better if Janssen did not have to compete against the 94% and 95% efficacy seen in trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.\n",
      "\"You know what the problem is? If this were out there and we didn't have the Moderna 94-95% .... We would have said wow, a 72% effective vaccine that's even more effective against severe disease is really terrific,\" he said in a telephone interview.\n",
      "\"But now we're always judging it against 94 to 95%. Having said that, this is a vaccine that could have use particularly in developing countries to keep people out of the hospital. It has a very good efficacy against severe disease,\" Fauci added.\n",
      "Mammen said the Janssen vaccine was tested later, after new variants of coronavirus were already circulating. One in particular, called B.1.135, was dominant in South Africa when the vaccine was tested there. This variant has mutations that might be expected to weaken the vaccine's effects somewhat.\n",

      "Plus people do not have to worry about coming back for a second dose.\n",
      "\"We really wanted it to be a single dose. So we optimized our antigen so that we get enough immunogenicity after one dose, as opposed to two,\" he said.\n",

      "Janssen is already testing a two-dose regimen of the vaccine and that could increase the efficacy, Fauci said.\n",
      "\"Let's see what that shows. It could possibly bring it up to 90%,\" he said. \"Heck if you got 72 with a single dose, you would think you would do pretty good with a boost.\"\n",

      "(CNN) -- The Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine appears to substantially reduce transmission of the virus, rather than simply preventing symptomatic infections, UK researchers have suggested.\n",
      "The rate of positive PCR tests declined by about half after two doses, according to preliminary results by researchers at the University of Oxford that have yet to be peer reviewed.\n",
      "Their analysis, released as a preprint Tuesday, also supports spacing out doses and estimates good efficacy after just one shot of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.\n",
      "The study did not measure transmission directly -- for example, by tracing contacts who were infected by study volunteers. But the researchers did collect regular nasal swabs from some participants and found that the rate of positive PCR tests fell by half after two doses of the vaccine. After one dose only, the rate of positive tests fell by 67%.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "\"While transmission studies per se were not included in the analysis, swabs were obtained from volunteers every week in the UK study, regardless of symptoms, to allow assessment of the overall impact of the vaccine on risk of infection and thus a surrogate for potential onward transmission,\" the authors write.\n",
      "If the vaccine were simply making infections milder, PCR positivity would not change, the authors argued in the preprint analysis. \"A measure of overall PCR positivity is appropriate to assess whether there is a reduction in the burden of infection.\"\n",
      "Coronavirus vaccine trials have primarily looked at prevention of symptomatic cases of COVID-19. Previously, there has been little other public data suggesting that vaccines could prevent people from passing the infection to others.\n",
      "Speaking to the UK's Science Media Centre (SMC), Helen Fletcher, professor of immunology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the data in the study \"suggest a possibility that the vaccine could have an impact on transmission but further follow-up would be needed to confirm this.\"\n",
      "Dr. Doug Brown, chief executive of the British Society for Immunology, told the SMC the study \"hints that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine may be effective in stopping people being able to transmit the virus.\"\n",
      "He added: \"While this would be extremely welcome news, we do need more data before this can be confirmed and so it's important that we all still continue to follow social distancing guidance after we have been vaccinated.\"\n",
      "Dose spacing\n",
      "The vaccine showed 66.7% efficacy against symptomatic disease starting two weeks after the second shot, researchers at the University of Oxford said.\n",
      "The new analysis adds new trial sites and a month of new data to the mix, building upon earlier results announced by AstraZeneca that its vaccine had showed an estimated 70.4% efficacy.\n",
      "However, the latest research also suggests the vaccine may offer substantial protection after a single shot.\n",
      "The study estimates 76% efficacy up to three months following one dose. This is based on a subset of 88 symptomatic infections, split unevenly between the vaccine and placebo groups between 22 and 90 days after vaccination. The study also found relatively stable levels of antibodies during this time frame, \"with minimal waning by day 90.\"\n",
      "Furthermore, the authors suggest there could be higher efficacy with more spaced-out doses. Among adults age 18 to 55, vaccine efficacy appeared to rise when the time between shots was spaced out from less than six weeks to more than 12. However, more information is needed to know how statistically different that finding is.\n",
      "Taken together, the findings may bolster the UK's decision to recommend spacing out doses up to 12 weeks apart, according to a statement from the chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial and co-author of the paper, Andrew Pollard.\n",
      "\"This is positive news as it shows that just one dose of this vaccine generates good levels of immunity and that this protection does not seem to wane in the shorter term,\" said Brown, of the British Society for Immunology.\n",
      "\"In immunology terms, this finding is not unexpected as we know that some other vaccines confer better immunity when the doses are more spread out. Although further information is required to confirm these findings for older age groups, overall this new research should provide reassurance around the UK's decision to offer the two doses of this vaccine 12 weeks apart.\"\n",
      "Similar data is not yet available on delaying the second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to 12 weeks after the first dose, said Dr. Gillies O'Bryan-Tear, past chair of policy and communications at the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine in comments to the SMC. But, he added, \"most commentators agree that it is likely to be the same with that vaccine, and indeed, other two dose vaccines.\"\n",
      "The authors caveat that the trials were not initially designed to evaluate efficacy by dose intervals, but the data \"arose due to the logistics of running large-scale clinical trials in a pandemic setting.\"\n",
      "The primary analysis is based on 332 symptomatic infections that occurred among more than 17,000 trial volunteers in the UK, Brazil and South Africa more than two weeks after their second dose.\n",
      "AstraZeneca announced last month it had completed enrollment in its Phase 3 trial in the United States, which will serve as \"the primary basis\" for the company's eventual application to the US Food and Drug Administration.\n",

      "\"Pfizer and BioNTech's Phase 3 study for the Covid-19 vaccine was designed to evaluate the vaccine's safety and efficacy following a 2-dose schedule, separated by 21 days,\" Pfizer said in a statement last month. \"There are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.\"\n",
      "But the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland explained the move in a letter to health care professionals after the vaccine was approved, saying it was based on the \"balance of risks and benefits,\" and that the \"great majority\" of initial protection came from the first jab.\n",

      "(CNN)— Alaska, one of the states leading the US in vaccinations, has made the Covid-19 vaccine available to any resident ages 16 and up.\n",
      "It's the first state in the US to remove nearly every eligibility requirement for the Covid-19 vaccine -- a milestone possible, the state's chief medical officer said, because of the state's success in vaccinating vulnerable Alaskans.\n",
      "\"Soon this virus will be a preventable disease, if people choose to get vaccinated,\" said Dr. Anne Zink of Alaska's Department of Health and Social Services in a Tuesday news conference. \"This is our shot to end the pandemic.\"\n",

      "How Alaska is getting vaccinations right\n",
      "Alaska has consistently ranked among the top states in percentage of residents vaccinated, according to CNN's Covid-19 vaccine tracker. About 41 vaccine doses have been administered for every 100 residents, and over 16% of the state's population has been fully vaccinated.\n",
      "The state's robust public health system -- and experience in distributing vaccines to the far reaches of the massive state -- had equipped it for a successful vaccine rollout, Zink told CNN last week. And the state's 229 sovereign tribes received their own vaccine allocations, which relieved some of the pressure off the state to provide for all 730,000-plus residents.\n",
      "Even before Tuesday's announcement, Alaska's vaccine eligibility had already expanded to include essential workers, residents of multigenerational housing and young people who accompanied seniors to their vaccination appointment, a strategy that Zink and officials from the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium said addressed the disproportionate death rates among low-income residents and Alaska Natives.\n",
      "The state currently has 430,685 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine -- not enough to vaccinate the entire state within a few weeks.\n",
      "\"We know we don't have enough vaccine in the state of Alaska to do everyone tonight,\" Zink said. \"But even if you're thinking about it, let (the state's Covid-19 helpline) know, and they can help connect you to an appointment if appointments become filled quickly as more vaccine comes into the state.\"\n",

      "(CNN) — US President Joe Biden's coronavirus response team learned two things his first week in office: Johnson & Johnson's one-shot coronavirus vaccine was highly effective -- but the company was millions of doses behind its production schedule.\n",
      "Preliminary conversations that began under the Trump administration about a vaccine manufacturing partnership between the pharmaceutical giant and its competitor, Merck, whose own vaccine attempt had failed, were \"incremental\" and going nowhere fast, according to two senior administration officials. And Johnson & Johnson seemed reluctant to commit to a large-scale deal with Merck, the officials said.\n",
      "\"They just were not all in,\" one of the officials told CNN.\n",
      "That changed when Jeff Zients, the White House's coronavirus czar, called Johnson & Johnson's CEO Alex Gorsky on a Sunday in early February and urged the company to meet the moment, stressing that the US is in a \"national emergency\" and that it was time to go \"big and bold.\"\n",
      "\"You can't be incremental and small in your thinking. We have to overwhelm this problem,\" one senior administration official said, recounting the conversation, which lasted an hour more than the scheduled 15 minutes.\n",
      "Zients reminded Gorsky -- a West Point graduate and US military veteran -- of Johnson & Johnson's major contributions during World War II, including manufacturing the first-ever duct tape and other military supplies. Just as Americans remembered Johnson & Johnson's contributions then, its efforts to accelerate the vaccination of Americans would be their new legacy, Zients said, according to two senior officials.\n",
      "\"That was really a turning point,\" one of the officials said, noting that Gorsky \"embraced\" the approach and discussions about a large-scale partnership with Merck quickly turned more serious.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "Hanging over that conversation and others between Biden administration officials and executives from both companies was Biden's authority under the Defense Production Act to compel the companies to partner if they were unwilling. A senior administration official said that authority was never explicitly threatened in conversations with both companies, but added that it was implicitly a motivating factor.\n",
      "\"The DPA is always there, implicitly as a tool, which brings people to the table and puts people on their toes,\" the official said.\n",
      "The administration would have been willing to invoke the DPA's coercive authorities had the two companies not reached an agreement, but did not need to, the official said. Instead, Biden is exercising other authorities under the DPA to invest $105 million to help Merck retrofit its manufacturing facilities to produce the vaccine at scale and to expedite the supply of key vaccine production materials to Johnson & Johnson.\n",
      "Biden announced the partnership on Tuesday, which he said will speed the production of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine and ensure the US has \"enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,\" two months earlier than previously anticipated. He compared the partnership to \"the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War II.\"\n",
      "A Johnson & Johnson spokesman declined to comment for this story, referring CNN to comments Gorsky, the company's CEO, made Wednesday at a Washington Post event.\n",
      "Gorsky said the company felt compelled to \"be doing everything we can to accelerate\" vaccine production and \"make a real difference with this virus.\"\n",
      "\"In discussions with the government and trying to say, 'Hey what else could we be doing? How else could we accelerate?\" Gorsky said. \"And that's when in conversations that we were able to sit down together and bring this partnership to fruition.\"\n",
      "A Merck spokesman did not respond to CNN's requests for comment, but the company's executive vice president for manufacturing Sanat Chattopadhyay said in a statement Tuesday that the company looks \"forward to combining our expertise with Johnson & Johnson to help increase supply and expand access to\" the coronavirus vaccine.\n",
      "Discussions about a manufacturing partnership between Johnson & Johnson and Merck began during the Trump administration, which had secured the initial purchase of 100 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. While Trump administration officials did not secure the partnership, those Trump-era discussions helped open the door to a deal between the two pharmaceutical competitors.\n",
      "\"It simply wasn't coming fast enough,\" Biden said Tuesday of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. \"So my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.\"\n",
      "A senior Biden administration official insisted that the conversations between the two companies with Trump administration officials were \"small ball,\" looking to make incremental increases in Johnson & Johnson's production rather than maximizing production capabilities and ensuring Johnson & Johnson facilities would be producing vaccines on a 24/7 schedule -- which will now be the case.\n",
      "\"There's a difference between conversations and it moving forward and the use of the Defense Production Act, which is something this president, and not the prior president, committed to invoking,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said on Tuesday, referring to the assistance to both companies to speed vaccine production.\n",
      "Moncef Slaoui, the Trump administration's coronavirus vaccine czar, did not respond to CNN's requests for comment.\n",
      "While administration officials described Zients' early February conversation with Gorsky as a \"turning point,\" it followed several other conversations between Zients and David Kessler, Biden's chief science officer charged with accelerating vaccine production and distribution, and executives at Johnson & Johnson and Merck.\n",
      "While Biden did not call either company's CEOs directly, a senior official said the President was updated on the negotiations on a regular basis.\n",
      "Those conversations were also facilitated by Zients' preexisting relationships with the CEOs of both companies, whom he knew from his time in the Obama administration working on health care and economic issues.\n",
      "The two senior officials also credited Johnson & Johnson and Merck for ultimately getting on board with a partnership following key conversations in early February, with one official saying they \"have really been good corporate citizens in forming this partnership.\"\n",

      "(CNN) — Study subjects who received Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine had positive early results, according to the biotech company, which partnered with the National Institutes of Health to develop the vaccine.\n",
      "If future studies go well, the company's vaccine could be available to the public as early as January, Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer, told CNN.\n",
      "\"This is absolutely good news and news that we think many have been waiting for for quite some time,\" Zaks said.\n",
      "These early data come from the Phase 1 clinical trial, which typically studies a small number of people and focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and elicits an immune response.\n",
      "The results of the study, which was led by the National Institutes Health, have not been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.\n",
      "Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of eight developers worldwide doing human clinical trials with a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization.  Two others, Pfizer and Inovio, are also in th United States, one is at the University of Oxford in Britain, and four are in China.\n",
      "Moderna has vaccinated dozens of study participants and measured antibodies in eight of them. All eight developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus at levels reaching or exceeding the levels seen in people who've naturally recovered from Covid-19, according to the company.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus, disabling it from attacking human cells.\n",
      "\"We've demonstrated that these antibodies, this immune response, can actually block the virus,\" Zaks said. \"I think this is a very important first step in our journey towards having a vaccine.\"\n",
      "A vaccine specialist who is not involved in Moderna's work said the company's results are \"great.\"\n",
      "\"It shows that not only did the antibody bind to the virus, but it prevented the virus from infecting the cells,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the NIH panel that's setting a framework for vaccine studies in the US.\n",
      "While the vaccine had promising results in the lab, it's not known if it will protect people in the real world. The US Food and Drug Administration has cleared the company to begin Phase 2 trials, which typically involve several hundred of people, and Moderna plans to start large-scale clinical trials, known as Phase 3 trials, in July, which typically involve tens of thousands of people.\n",
      "Offit said before the pandemic, vaccine developers would typically test out their product in thousands of people before moving on to Phase 3, but that Moderna is \"extremely unlikely\" to have vaccinated that many by July, since they've only vaccinated dozens so far.\n",
      "He said it makes sense to Moderna to move into Phase 3 without vaccinating that many people, given that Covid-19 is killing thousands of people each day.\n",
      "\"This is a different time,\" Offit said.\n",
      "In January, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said it would take about 12 to 18 months to get a vaccine on the market. Zaks said he agreed with that estimate for Moderna's vaccine, putting a delivery date somewhere between January and June of next year.\n",
      "In the Moderna study, three participants developed fever and other flu-like symptoms when they received the vaccine at a dose of 250 micrograms. Moderna anticipates the Phase 3 study on dosage will be between 25 and 100 micrograms.\n",
      "So far, the Moderna study subjects who were vaccinated even at 25 and 100 micrograms achieved antibody levels similar to or even higher than people who naturally became infected with coronavirus.\n",
      "But it's not clear whether natural infection confers immunity to re-infection, and so similarly it's not clear whether vaccination confers immunity.\n",
      "\"That's a good question, and the truth is, we don't know that yet,\" Zaks said. \"We are going to have to conduct formal efficacy trials where you vaccinate many, many people, and then you monitor them in the ensuing months to make sure they don't get sick.\"\n",

      "(CNN)— The United Kingdom has become the first Western nation to begin vaccinating its citizens with a COVID-19 shot outside of clinical trials — a landmark moment in the coronavirus pandemic.\n",
      "The first Briton to get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine — 90-year-old Margaret Keenan — received the first of two doses at 6:31 a.m. local time on Tuesday at University Hospital in Coventry, less than a week after the UK became the first country to approve it.\n",
      "Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said she felt \"privileged\" to be first to get the shot. \"It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the New Year after being on my own for most of the year,\" she said, according to a statement released by the UK's National Health Service (NHS).\n",
      "The logistical challenges of manufacturing and distributing tens of millions of vaccines mean the roll out will be gradual, with the most vulnerable people and health care workers first in line.\n",
      "May Parsons, the nurse who administered the historic jab, said she was honored to be involved in the program. \"The last few months have been tough for all of us working in the NHS, but now it feels like there is light at the end of the tunnel,\" she said.\n",
      "The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the vaccine, but only 800,000 shots will be available as part of the first wave that began on Tuesday.\n",
      "Because the vaccine requires two doses administered at least three weeks apart, the UK will have enough shots to vaccinate roughly a third of the country's population. The country has also ordered 7 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which could be approved for emergency use in the UK within the next few weeks.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "There will be 50 vaccination hubs in hospitals across England and dozens more across Wales and Scotland. In England, the vaccinations will only be administered by hospitals. Wales and Scotland have yet to specify the types of locations they plan to have administer the vaccine.\n",
      "Keenan will have to go back for the second dose in three or four weeks' time. According to the government's guidance, each vaccinated person will receive a credit card-sized vaccination document with details of their next appointment. Seven to 10 days after the second dose, she should be protected against the virus.\n",
      "While the UK's immunization program started with a big bang on Tuesday, the vaccine remains off limits to the vast majority of people.\n",
      "For now, it is available by invitation only for those age 80 and over, care homes staff and frontline health and social care workers. Care home residents were also expected to be prioritized, but the government said last week this won't happen immediately.\n",
      "The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine needs to be stored at minus 75 degrees Celsius (minus 103 degrees Fahrenheit), which makes its distribution difficult. Moderna's vaccine, if approved, could be a more practical option for the care homes, as it can be kept at minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 degrees Fahrenheit).\n",
      "The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine offers 95% protection against Covid-19. According to the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), more than one in 10 recipients may suffer side effects including pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain, and fever. A handful of other, less common, side effects are also listed.\n",
      "The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to follow the UK's MHRA and authorize the emergency use for the Pfizer vaccine as soon as this week — its vaccine advisory committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday.\n",
      "The European Medicines Agency will conclude its decision on the vaccine on December 29, according to the European Commission.\n",

      "(CNN) -- People with a \"significant history of allergic reactions\" should not be given the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, the UK's National Health Service (NHS) advised after two healthcare workers had symptoms after receiving a shot on Tuesday.\n",
      "The precautionary advice was given after the pair \"responded adversely\" following their shots on the first day of the mass vaccination rollout in the UK, NHS England said Wednesday.\n",
      "According to PA Media, it is understood that both staff members had a significant history of allergic reactions and carried adrenaline autoinjectors. Thousands overall are believed to have been vaccinated in the UK on Tuesday.\n",
      "\"As is common with new vaccines the MHRA [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday,\" said Stephen Powis, the national medical director for NHS England, in a statement. \"Both are recovering well.\"\n",
      "\"Any person with a history of a significant allergic reaction to a vaccine, medicine or food (such as previous history of anaphylactoid reaction or those who have been advised to carry an adrenaline autoinjector) should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,\" states the new MHRA advice, reported PA Media. It said that vaccines \"should only be carried out in facilities where resuscitation measures are available.\"\n",
      "Vaccine expert Dr. Paul Offit told CNN that allergic reactions to vaccines were not uncommon: \"Certainly, vaccines can cause severe allergic reactions. In the United States, roughly one of every 1.4 million doses of vaccines is complicated by a severe allergic reaction.\"\n",
      "He said that rather than a \"blanket recommendation\" for people with allergies, \"the smarter thing to do would be to try and look at these two patients and see what specific component of the vaccine they were allergic to.\"\n",
      "He said people should realize that there are immediate treatments for allergic reaction. \"That's why you're hanging out in the doctor's office,\" he said, before warning that the reports of allergic reactions \"will only serve as yet another way to scare people.\"\n",
      "Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that the authorization and approval process for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine \"has been incredibly robust.\" The head of Britain's medicines regulator also put out assurances on Sunday, saying the Pfizer/BioNTech shot was \"as safe as any general vaccine.\"\n",
      "US drug giant Pfizer and German company BioNTech have said there are \"no serious safety concerns\" over the vaccine.\n",

      "(CNN) — As the United States on Thursday surpassed 17 million official Covid-19 cases, a US Food and Drug Administration advisory panel recommended a second coronavirus vaccine for the country.\n",
      "The developments come as the US, after starting distribution of its first authorized vaccine this week, is dealing with record rates of daily cases, daily deaths and numbers of Covid-19 patients in hospitals.\n",
      "The FDA is widely expected to grant emergency use authorization for Moderna's vaccine candidate -- as it did for Pfizer's vaccine last week -- after its vaccine advisory panel voted to recommend it.\n",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would need to greenlight the vaccine before shots can be administered -- and a CDC advisory panel is expected to meet on the matter Saturday, raising the possibility that the Moderna vaccine could be used next week.\n",
      "The recently authorized Pfizer vaccine, meanwhile, has been administered to hundreds of US health care workers this week, and drug store chains CVS and Walgreens are helping to get shots to long-term care residents and staff members.\n",
      "But as vaccinations begin, recorded cases, hospitalizations and deaths are rising to levels not previously seen, as hospital staff around the country warn they're running out of space and energy to provide sufficient care:\n",
      "• Average cases: The country's average number of daily cases across a week was 215,729 on Wednesday -- a record high, Johns Hopkins University data show. That's more than three times what the daily case average was during a summer peak in July.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "• Cases in one day: The US recorded 247,403 cases on Wednesday, a record for one day.\n",
      "• Deaths: The nation averaged 2,569 deaths daily across the last week -- the highest average yet. The total reported Wednesday -- 3,656 -- is a one-day high.\n",
      "• Hospitalizations: 113,090 Covid-19 patients were in US hospitals Wednesday -- the most recorded on a given day, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\n",
      "The White House coronavirus task force warned this week that although spread has slowed somewhat in the northern and central US, cases are still surging in more populated states.\n",
      "And it lamented that state and local governments are \"not implementing the same mitigation policies that stemmed the tide of the summer surge,\" citing indoor gatherings at home and calling for a \"significant reduction in capacity or closure in public and private indoor spaces, including restaurants and bars.\"\n",
      "Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of Emory University's school of medicine, said he agreed.\n",
      "\"We're just simply saying, 'Well, we're getting vaccine.' But the vaccine is coming way too late for thousands of people who will die before we get the vaccine\" distributed widely,\" del Rio told CNN's New Day\" on Thursday.\n",
      "\"Transmissions (of the virus) are actively happening, and I think before the end of the year, we may be getting close to 4,000 deaths a day,\" del Rio said.\n",
      "The country's total official case count stood at more than 17,149,231 on Thursday afternoon, according to JHU, only five days after the count surpassed 16 million and just hours after passing the 17 million mark. But researchers have said the actual number of US infections -- counting those that weren't tested for -- probably is many millions higher.\n",
      "'We are still in for a very rough few weeks at least'\n",
      "Health experts have said Americans have important choices to make: The upcoming holidays could help drive another surge of cases, hospitalizations and, inevitably, deaths, if people opt to travel and gather again.\n",
      "Despite a warning from the CDC before Thanksgiving urging against travel, more than 4 million spent the holiday away from home.\n",
      "In California, Los Angeles County has frequently broken records for new daily cases, hospitalizations and daily deaths in recent weeks. On Thursday, about 65% of the county's hospitals were on \"diversion,\" meaning they could no longer accept new patients and had to direct incoming ambulances to other facilities.\n",
      "Health Director Barbara Ferrer attributed the surges to residents gathering over the Thanksgiving holiday, despite repeated pleas to stay home.\n",
      "\"This is a post-holiday surge that doesn't need to be,\" Ferrer told CNN. \"This is a lot of intermingling that needn't have happened.\"\n",
      "And the worst is yet to come, county health services director Dr. Christina Ghaly said earlier this week. \"We are still in for a very rough few weeks at least, and potentially through January,\" Ghaly said.\n",
      "By late Thursday, four of five California regions will officially be under a state-mandated stay-at-home order, because intensive-care unit capacity in those regions fell below 15%.\n",
      "Three regions fell under the order earlier this month, and it officially goes into effect in the fourth -- the entire San Fransciso Bay Area -- at 11:59 p.m. PT, after the ICU capacity fell below the threshold this week, state officials said.\n",
      "Officials in much of the Bay Area preemptively ordered their residents to stay home earlier this month because the capacity was dropping. But this week's data puts the entire region under the state order, which now covers all of the state except a mostly rural region stretching from north of Sacramento to the Oregon state line.\n",
      "Governors across the Northeast and Midwest, meanwhile, issued a video message this week encouraging residents to \"double down\" on safety measures and reconsider their holiday plans.\n",
      "\"If you are planning to travel or gather with other households for the holidays -- we urge you to reconsider,\" the governors said. \"Just one infection can cause an outbreak in your community, which could overwhelm our hospitals and put you and your loved ones at risk.\"\n",
      "In hopes of helping curb the spread around the holidays, El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego announced curfews from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. lasting from December 23 to December 26 and from December 30 to January 4.\n",

      "Politico was first to report that some pharmacists found they could get six -- and possibly even seven -- doses of vaccine out of vials, which are each designed to provide five doses. An FDA spokeswoman told CNN the agency was aware of the issue and \"working with Pfizer to determine the best path forward.\"\n",
      "\"At this time, given the public health emergency, FDA is advising that it is acceptable to use every full dose obtainable (the sixth, or possibly even a seventh) from each vial, pending resolution of the issue,\" the spokeswoman said. \"However, since the vials are preservative-free, it is critical to note that any further remaining product that does not constitute a full dose should not be pooled from multiple vials to create one.\"\n",
      "More than 2.9 million doses were allocated to states for the first Pfizer vaccine doses, according to a list published Wednesday by the CDC.\n",
      "The Pfizer vaccine requires each patient to receive two doses about 21 days apart, and the Moderna vaccine also would require two doses. Assuming the Moderna vaccine is authorized, the two products could combine for an availability of 40 million doses, for 20 million people, by the end of December, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said.\n",

      "(CNN) -- Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, whose foundation has been part of the effort to develop and deliver Covid-19 vaccines, said Sunday that the presidential transition is \"complicating\" efforts to distribute one, but that he's spoken with President-elect Joe Biden to ensure the US doesn't \"blow it\" again.\n",
      "\"The transition is complicating, but the new administration is willing to rely on actual experts and not attack those experts,\" Gates, the co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union.\"\n",
      "President Donald Trump has refused to concede the 2020 election to Biden and has not coordinated with the President-elect on the Covid-19 vaccine candidates and the massively complex distribution operation. Biden has said that the Trump administration had shared information -- but not a \"detailed plan\" -- with his transition team about the nationwide distribution of a vaccine.\n",
      "In his interview with Tapper, Gates praised Biden's incoming administration for \"laying out clear plans\" to slow the spread of Covid-19, adding that \"I think we'll get through this in a positive way.\"\n",
      "\"You know I'm pleased with the people and the priority that President-elect Biden and his team are bringing to bear on this problem,\" he said.\n",
      "The Gates Foundation on Thursday said it plans to commit an additional $250 million to support the \"research, development and equitable delivery\" of tools to fight Covid-19, including tests, treatments and vaccines. The announcement brings the group's total commitments to the global Covid-19 response to $1.75 billion.\n",
      "Gates lauded Biden for \"doing his best to retain\" Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who Gates said would be \"willing to admit when things aren't going well\" and \"deliver tough messages.\"\n",
      "\"I do think the US will not be one of the worst performers, as the (Biden) team comes into office,\" he added.\n",
      "The United States is the nation with the most cases and deaths from Covid-19. As of Sunday morning, the US had reported more than 16 million Covid-19 cases and nearly 300,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n",
      "Gates noted in his interview that the US \"would've been expected to be the best\" when it came to the pandemic given its federal health agencies and various technologies, but \"sadly ... we didn't get on top of it like many countries did,\" adding that future post-mortems on the crisis \"will guide us.\"\n",
      "Biden has laid out a three-point plan to combat the coronavirus pandemic, including aiming to distribute 100 million vaccine shots in his initial 100 days in office. Biden also told Tapper in an interview earlier this month, that he will ask Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days after he takes office.\n",
      "During his interview with Tapper, Gates confirmed that he has spoke with Biden about the pandemic.\n",
      "The price to pay each year \"to avoid, you know, a trillions of dollars disaster -- I think that roadmap's clear, and I talked with the President-elect about that. And you know, I think our foundation will be part of that dialogue to make sure we don't blow it again,\" Gates said.\n",
      "The US is close to a vaccine as the Food and Drug Administration on Friday issued an emergency use authorizaton for Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine. And the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted on Saturday to recommend the Pfizer vaccine for people ages 16 and older, moving the US another step closer to being able to inoculate millions of its citizens.\n",
      "Gates told Tapper that distribution \"should be based on medical need, not wealth at all.\"\n",
      "\"After all, this epidemic has been awful in the way that it's exacerbated inequities,\" he said.\n",

      "What happened March 4 before the dawn and into the night haunts her.\n",

      "\"That was the night (we had) like five ambulances in the parking lot,\" she said.\n",
      "It was the night she sent patients to the hospital whom she expected would be treated and eventually released. They never came back.\n",
      "It was the date she figured out \"the whole cascade of symptoms\" of a virus the nursing home learned had invaded just four days earlier.\n",
      "It was also the day she had to make some gut-wrenching phone calls.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "One at 3 a.m. she can't shake from her mind. She remembers the conversation with the woman on the other end of the line.\n",
      "\"I realized this was early in the morning, and this is very difficult to say that I am really sorry that your mom has passed away,\" Earnest said. \"I cried with her.\"\n",
      "The two, who had never met, shared a heartbreaking moment. Ten months later, they still sometimes talk, Earnest said.\n",
      "Earnest, a registered nurse, volunteered to help out the Kirkland nursing home from her position as a nursing director at another Life Care Center in the state.\n",
      "They needed all the help they could get. Nearly 70% of the staff had tested positive for coronavirus in March.\n",
      "She had no idea that the inconspicuous building on a tree-lined street in a quiet residential neighborhood in Kirkland would become America's first epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak.\n",
      "Eventually the state department of health reported 46 people linked to the nursing home died of coronavirus; 39 of them were patients. Ten patients died at the nursing home itself, Earnest said.\n",
      "\"It was like chasing a ghost,\" she told CNN in March. \"You're in a battlefield where supplies are limited. The help's slow to get to you and there's lots of casualties. And you can't see the enemy.\"\n",
      "Ten months since the initial outbreak, she and other frontline health care workers here are finally getting the best weapon available to battle the virus: the vaccine.\n",
      "Alice Cortez, a nursing manager at Life Care Center of Kirkland, was the first to get the vaccine here.\n",
      "\"This is an exciting day for everybody especially my team,\" she said as her voice cracked with emotion.\n",
      "\"What I feel right now is a new life, a new beginning, but a better life.\"\n",
      "One by one, nurses, a doctor and other frontline workers at the facility came outside to get their first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. That vaccine was the first to get emergency approval by the FDA.\n",
      "Coronavirus remains a threat at nursing homes\n",
      "But everyone here is well aware that the virus is still raging and remains a threat to the most vulnerable people: The people they are charged with caring for.\n",
      "For now, the Kirkland nursing home has no positive coronavirus cases. But of the 26 Life Care Center nursing homes in the region, eight facilities have Covid-19 cases right now. At one point this year, 24 of the 26 did.\n",
      "As of December 13, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees nursing homes, says 441,000 nursing home patients have tested positive for coronavirus across the United States and 86,775 nursing home residents have died from Covid-19. And 1,258 staff members have perished, too.\n",
      "\"There is not a day that goes by where I don't get a phone call or a message that we have a new positive patient or staff,\" said Nancy Butner, vice president of Life Care Centers of America Northwest division. Butner said some of her staff have been hospitalized recently. And more patients have died in other facilities.\n",
      "\"It is relentless,\" Butner said.\n",
      "Initially, some families and the public blamed the nurses, doctors and staff at Life Care Center of Kirkland for the outbreak and not controlling it better.\n",
      "The phones never stopped ringing. Families couldn't get through -- sometimes doctors couldn't -- because of other unwanted calls.\n",
      "\"It was very hard to go into a patient's room and hear the phone. And you think it's a doctor, and you get there and it's some person saying they have the cure for Covid giving you a recipe that is as crazier than they are,\" Earnst said.\n",
      "Too often, it was the most jarring kind of call: death threats, enough to require security. Earnest was afraid to go to her car one night after treating patients.\n",
      "\"My husband said, 'Make sure you have your gun,'\" she said, able to laugh about it now. But he was serious and so were the threats.\n",
      "Then there was the sight of the devastated families who showed up every day.\n",
      "Some had lost their mom or dad at the facility, and others had family still inside infected with Covid-19. They sat in chairs outside their family member's room window, eating lunch with them and having muffled conversations through the glass.\n",
      "Inside, the staff was dealing with a virus no one knew enough about.\n",
      "It was before the public was told to wear masks, before the elbow bump became the new handshake, before all of the symptoms were known. And it was before tens of thousands of people began getting sick and dying in New York City, which soon became the second epicenter of the virus.\n",
      "In April, state and federal agencies that oversee nursing homes also blamed Life Care Center of Kirkland. The federal report said: \"inspectors found three 'Immediate Jeopardy' situations, which are situations in which a patient's safety is placed in imminent danger.\"\n",
      "Life Care Center appealed the ruling. In September, a state administrative judge largely sided with the Life Care Center of Kirkland, not the state findings, which mimicked the federal ones.\n",
      "The judge said the state agency \"provided relatively little evidence that the facility actually failed to meet any expected standard of care or failed to follow public health guidelines.\"\n",
      "The federal appeal has not been decided.\n",
      "Changes made since the March outbreak\n",
      "In the beginning, there were not enough coronavirus tests, and it took days to get results. Now, they have rapid tests that take minutes.\n",
      "In some rooms, there were three patients. Now, that's down to one -- or two if they can be properly distanced.\n",
      "Before the virus, the facility accepted as many as 124 patients. Now they've capped it at 97.\n",
      "Back then, there was a constant worry about a lack of personal protective equipment. Now, a nearby facility has a large room stuffed with boxes of masks, gloves and other gear.\n",
      "But 10 months after the initial viral outbreak, the chairs for family members remain outside the windows of the rooms. Room numbers are scrawled on the windows.\n",
      "That has become a semi-permanent fixture because visitors still aren't allowed inside.\n",
      "There is no family hand-holding or hugs and kisses. It is simply too dangerous, the virus too contagious. The staff knows that now.\n",
      "In the beginning, Earnest, a registered nurse, was informing doctors and members of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of what she was seeing in patients. Now, they get constant updates and new safety protocols from government agencies.\n",
      "Covid-19 impacts staff inside and outside the nursing home\n",
      "Butner says what people don't often think about is that the staff has to battle the virus at work and at home.\n",
      "Earnest lost an uncle to Covid-19 this year. So before Christmas she had to have \"the talk\" with her mother about how she wanted to die.\n",
      "\"If she got it, what did she want? Did she want to be on a ventilator or did she want to be ... let go?\"\n",
      "It was the hardest conversation she's had with family. But she says she couldn't avoid it. No one should.\n",
      "It is too awful when they are taken away and isolated and you don't get to know their wishes. Sometimes you don't get to say goodbye, she said.\n",
      "Earnest said she hopes the vaccine will make these conversations less urgent. But not everybody at the nursing facilities is looking forward to getting it.\n",
      "\"We did a survey with the staff at our facilities before we did education on the vaccine. Twenty percent said no, never. They would not get vaccinated,\" she said.\n",
      "For now, she says, Life Care Centers of America isn't making it mandatory. The reason is simple.\n",
      "\"We simply could not lose 20% of our staff,\" she said. \"Another effect of this virus is an extreme shortage of nursing staff for all of health care.\"\n",
      "She is hoping that with education, the percentage will shrink.\n",
      "For physician's assistant Christy Carmichael, her decision to get the vaccine made everyone gasp. Last week she had promised one of her patients who had survived Covid-19 that she would be able get the vaccine.\n",
      "\"I said sure you can. Unfortunately she passed away,\" Carmichael said, before dissolving into tears after getting her vaccine shot. \"I did promise her that she would get it, so it's just sad that she didn't get to see this today.\"\n",

      "(CNN) -- Data on vaccines being tested by Johnson & Johnson and Novavax came out last week, and makers of AstraZeneca's vaccine and Russia's Sputnik V vaccine published some long-awaited details about their shots on Tuesday.\n",
      "All indicate high efficacy against the virus, even though they take very different approaches.\n",
      "Here's how some of the top coronavirus vaccines and vaccine candidates work.\n",
      "Pfizer/BioNTech\n",
      "Pfizer and its German-based partner BioNTech use a new approach to making vaccines that uses messenger RNA or mRNA.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "This design was chosen for a pandemic vaccine years ago because it's one that lends itself to quick turnaround. All that is needed is the genetic sequence of the virus causing the pandemic. Vaccine makers don't even need the virus itself -- just the sequence.\n",
      "In this case, BioNTech researchers used a little piece of genetic material coding for a piece of the spike protein -- those studs that cover the surface of the coronavirus and the source of its name. Corona means \"crown.\"\n",
      "Messenger RNA is a single strand of the genetic code that cells can \"read\" and use to make a protein. In the case of this vaccine, the mRNA instructs the muscle cells in the arm to make a particular piece of the virus's spike protein called the receptor binding domain. Then the immune system sees it, recognizes it as foreign and is prepared to attack when actual infection occurs.\n",
      "\"RNA is like snapchat messages that expire. RNA vaccines do NOT become a permanent part of your body. They are temporary messages instructing cells to make one viral protein temporarily,\" Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, said on Twitter.\n",
      "\"It takes 25 different coronavirus proteins to make a coronavirus, so there is no worry about the RNA making a virus.\"\n",
      "Clinical trials showed Pfizer's vaccine was 95% effective in preventing symptomatic infections. Pfizer is working to show the vaccine can prevent all infections, including those that don't cause symptoms. It has also been testing its vaccine against some of the worrying new variants of coronavirus. So far, the studies indicate the vaccine can protect against variants causing concern in South Africa and the UK.\n",
      "MRNA is very fragile so it's encased in lipid nanoparticles -- a coating of a buttery substance that can melt at room temperature. That's why Pfizer's vaccine must be kept at ultracold temperatures of about minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 75 degrees Celsius). That means special equipment is needed to transport and store this vaccine.\n",
      "Pfizer's vaccine won FDA EUA in December and is being delivered to millions of people in the US and UK. The US government has contracted to buy 300 million doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.\n",
      "Side-effects from vaccination are rare and usually mild. They include fever and headache, although a very few people have experienced allergic reactions to the vaccine. It's not clear what causes the allergic reaction, and the FDA and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are investigating.\n",
      "Moderna\n",
      "Moderna's vaccine is also based on mRNA. \"mRNA is like software for the cell,\" Moderna said on its website.\n",
      "And like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, it codes for cells to make a piece of the spike protein.\n",
      "The Moderna vaccine also goes into the muscle cells of the arm, and perhaps to nearby immune system cells, and instructs them to make pieces of spike protein.\n",
      "Clinical trials showed Moderna's vaccine was 94% effective in preventing symptomatic infections and the company says it has data showing the vaccine also prevents all infections, including those that do not cause symptoms.\n",
      "Moderna thinks its vaccine will protect against the coronavirus for at least a year\n",
      "Moderna has come up with a different formulation for the lipid nanoparticles to protect the mRNA in its vaccine. These formulations are corporate secrets, but Moderna thinks its approach is better and said its vaccine can be shipped at minus 20 degrees C (minus 4 degrees F) and can be kept stable for 30 days at 2 degrees to 8 degrees C (36 to 46F), the temperature of a standard home refrigerator.\n",
      "The FDA authorized Moderna's vaccine in December. The US government has contracted to purchase 200 million doses of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine, and is in talks to purchase another 100 million doses.\n",
      "Johnson & Johnson's vaccine arm, Janssen Pharmaceuticals\n",
      "Janssen's coronavirus vaccine is a recombinant vector vaccine. It uses a genetically engineered version of adenovirus 26, which can cause the common cold, but the gene tinkering has disabled it. It also delivers the genetic instructions to make a piece of spike protein.\n",
      "This is one vaccine that has been tested on the market before. The adenovirus 26 vector was used to make the company's Ebola vaccine, which won marketing authorization from the European Commission in July.\n",
      "It's the only vaccine tested as a single shot -- a significant advantage in a world complicated by the need to ensure people get two carefully spaced doses of vaccine. Plus, it can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures.\n",
      "Preliminary data released last week showed the vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate and severe disease in a global Phase 3 trial, but 72% effective in the US trial. Plus, it was 85% effective in preventing severe disease, and almost completely effective in preventing death.\n",
      "\"A vaccine that's inexpensive, that's a single dose, and that has no cold chain requirements -- that's pretty good,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.\n",
      "Johnson & Johnson is expected to apply for emergency use authorization this week. The company said expects to supply 100 million vaccine doses to the US government in the first half of 2021.\n",
      "The company is also testing a two-dose regimen in volunteers to see if adding a second dose gives better or longer-lasting protection.\n",
      "AstraZeneca\n",
      "AstraZeneca's vaccine, made with a team at Britain's University of Oxford, is, like Janssen's, a vector vaccine. It uses an adenovirus that infects chimpanzees, but doesn't make people sick, to carry the spike protein from the coronavirus into cells.\n",
      "It was modified so that it doesn't replicate itself, then genetically engineered to inject cells with the DNA encoding for the full coronavirus spike protein.\n",
      "It's a cheaper way to make vaccines -- but slower than using RNA. The company has pledged to make its vaccine available inexpensively to countries around the world. The vaccine can be kept stable for six months at standard refrigerator temperatures, the company said.\n",
      "It's approved in Britain but the US FDA is waiting for data from US trials.\n",
      "Data released from trials in Britain, South Africa and Brazil in a Lancet preprint Tuesday indicated it's about 67% effective at preventing symptomatic infection two weeks after two doses. But the Oxford team also tested some volunteers to see if they became infected at all, and said they think the vaccine prevents infections in general.\n",
      "Plus, the studies indicated a single dose of vaccine prevented 76% of symptomatic infections for up to 90 days, and if more time passed between the first and second doses, the efficacy improved. When volunteers waited 12 weeks between doses, the vaccine's efficacy went up to 82%. A longer wait between doses would help get more people vaccinated, since the companies are struggling to keep up with demand.\n",
      "Novavax\n",
      "Maryland-based biotechnology company Novavax specializes in \"protein subunit\" vaccines. They use virus-like nanoparticles as a base and cover them with genetically engineered pieces of the coronavirus spike protein.\n",
      "This is also a tried and true vaccine approach. A hepatitis B vaccine given to newborns is a protein subunit vaccine, as is the human papillomavirus or HPV vaccine and FluBlok, Sanofi's influenza vaccine.\n",
      "Novavax uses an insect virus called a baculovirus to get the coronavirus spike protein into moth cells, which then produce the protein. This is harvested and mixed with an adjuvant -- an immune booster --based on saponin, found in soap bark trees.\n",
      "A Phase 3 trial conducted in the UK showed the vaccine had an efficacy of 89%, the company said last week. It has not published any data yet, but announced results in a news release. The vaccine was found to have 95.6% efficacy against the original novel coronavirus and 85.6% against the variant first identified in the UK, known as B.1.1.7.\n",
      "And a Phase 2b study conducted in South Africa indicated the vaccine was 60% effective against a variant circulating there and known as B.1.351 -- although efficacy went down if HIV-positive volunteers were included.\n",
      "Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline\n",
      "This is also a protein subunit vaccine, using Sanofi's FluBlok technology with a GlaxoSmithKline adjuvant. It also uses a baculovirus to grow little bits of spike protein.\n",

      "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, February 28) — The Philippines received its first COVID-19 vaccine shipment from China on Sunday, but President Rodrigo Duterte said he is waiting to be inoculated with a different brand — also a Chinese one — as per his doctor’s advice.\n",
      "“Kaming mga 70 [years old], we have to be careful. Ako naman, may doctor akong sarili. She thinks that another brand, I would not mention it... 'Yun nalang ang hinihintay nya and hinihintay ko,” the President, who is turning 76 next month, said in a press briefing.\n",
      "[Translation: For 70-year-olds like us, we have to be careful. I have a doctor who thinks I should be injected with another brand, but I won’t mention the name. That’s what she and I are waiting for.]\n",
      "The briefing came after the arrival of 600,000 doses of Sinovac’s CoronaVac, which were donated by the Chinese government. Earlier, the Food and Drug Administration said Sinovac is not the most ideal for senior citizens, as well as healthcare workers constantly exposed to the virus, due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4%. But Health spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire later said that while clinical trials show lower efficacy in preventing mild symptoms, CoronaVac is still 100% effective against moderate and severe symptoms.\n",
      "\"In the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage... No doubt about it,\" Duterte added. \"As to what brand, ‘yan ang problema [that's the problem], because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor.\"\n",
      "The President said his doctor is eyeing another \"Chinese brand.\" While it is not clear if this is Sinopharm, he earlier expressed preference for the particular pharmaceutical firm. Sinopharm vaccine has also been administered to his security detail and allegedly to other high-ranking government officials despite the absence of regulatory approval in the country.\n",

      "Despite not planning to receive it himself, Duterte has guaranteed the safety and effectiveness of Sinovac vaccines. His reassurance comes in the heels of hesitancy, especially among healthcare workers who are first in line in the national immunization program.\n",
      "“To my fellow Filipinos, please set your fears aside. These vaccines are backed by science and deliberated by Filipino experts,” he said in a speech during the turnover ceremony. However, he also later on said he will not force those who are not comfortable to be inoculated with them.\n",
      "The President defended last month the government’s preference for vaccines produced in China, saying that they are as good as those made by American and European pharmaceutical companies.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque advised the public to take whatever COVID-19 vaccine is available as soon as possible.\n",
      "“Uulitin ko lang po ang mga sinabi ng mga experts. Ang pinakamagaling na bakuna ay ang nariyan na at maaari nang gamitin,” said Roque.\n",
      "[Translation: I will just reiterate what the experts have said. The best vaccine you can get is the one that is already available and ready for use.]\n",
      "Besides the donation, Roque said the country has purchased 25 million more doses of COVID-19 vaccines from Sinovac.\n",
      "The national government is aiming to inoculate 50 to 70 million Filipinos within the year. Some 525,600 doses of the British-made AstraZeneca vaccine are supposed to arrive in the Philippines on Monday, but officials said the delivery had been postponed due to supply shortage.\n",

      "(CNN) -- New data shows that the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine \"provides high levels of protection against infection and symptomatic disease,\" Public Health England (PHE) said in a press release on Monday.\n",
      "PHE's Siren Study, which was carried out on healthcare workers aged under the age of 65, found that one dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 72% after three weeks, while two vaccine doses reduced the risk of infection by 85%. This high level of protection extended to the B.1.1.7 coronavirus variant first identified in the UK in December.\n",
      "Health workers were tested for COVID-19 infection every two weeks using PCR tests and twice a week with lateral flow tests, Dr. Susan Hopkins, strategic response director at PHE, explained, meaning \"there was a lot of asymptomatic testing,\" she said.\n",
      "\"Overall we are seeing a really strong effect to reducing any infection: asymptomatic and symptomatic,\" Hopkins said during a press conference held by the UK's Science Media Centre on Monday.\n",
      "PHE also analyzed routine testing data based on symptomatic disease in over 12,000 people, which showed that one dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was 57% effective against symptomatic COVID-19 disease in those aged over 80 four weeks after the first dose. This increased to 88% one week after the second dose.\n",
      "Early data has also shown that vaccinated people who are subsequently infected are far less likely to die of, or be hospitalized with, the virus. People over the age of 80 who were infected post vaccination were 41% less likely to be hospitalized with the virus and 57% less likely to die of it.\n",
      "PHE predicted that protection against severe disease was likely to be over 75% in those who have received one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\n",
      "\"The good sign is overall we are beginning to see a decline in hospitalizations and deaths in those vaccinated age groups [and] at least some is attributable to the vaccination program,\" Dr. Mary Ramsay, head of immunization at PHE, said during the press conference.\n",
      "She said that while the UK's current lockdown had played a part in the decline in hospitalizations, \"the faster speed in decline can be attributed in some aspects to the vaccination program.\"\n",
      "In the PHE release, Ramsay cautioned that despite the encouraging signs \"we don't yet know how much these vaccines will reduce the risk of you passing COVID-19 on to others,\" adding that vaccinated people should continue to follow stay-at-home orders.\n",
      "The UK has placed its focus on vaccinating as many high-risk people as possible with the first dose.\n",
      "UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was \"extremely encouraging\" that data supported the UK government's \"decision to maximize the number of people vaccinated with a single dose.\"\n",

      "Reality can differ from promises\n",
      "Yuri Varlamov, a teacher in Moscow and a member of the union, said he doesn't want to take the vaccine because he doesn't believe it is safe right now.\n",
      "\"Before the end of trials, they cannot make it mandatory. But I know that in some schools and state bodies, people are talking about mandatory status of this vaccine by the end of this year,\" Varlamov said.\n",
      "Marina Balouyeva, co-chairman of the \"Uchitel\" union, said a petition against compulsory vaccination for teachers was more of a precaution.\n",
      "Balouyeva said she is wary of Sputnik-V for several reasons. \"Firstly, it is generally known that the quality of domestic vaccines is worse than that of foreign ones,\" she said.\n",
      "\"Secondly, the vaccine was created at railway speed, which already raises concerns. It was created in haste.\"\n",
      "Despite promises from authorities that taking the vaccine will be voluntary, she said she fears things could go differently in reality, as often happens in Russian state institutions.\n",
      "Balouyeva said no complaints have yet been made to her union from teachers saying they are being forced to be vaccinated. However, previous experience indicates there have been such problems with other vaccines, she says.\n",
      "For example, officially, the seasonal flu shot is not mandatory for Russian educational workers -- it is voluntary. But according to Balouyeva some schools require it from their employees without fail.\n",
      "Whether there will be sanctions on those unwilling to be vaccinated with Sputnik-V, depends on the headteacher. Most schools have a so-called \"incentive bonus\" -- a fund of money that the administration can distribute as they see fit. Some teachers could be deprived of this payment if they don't get the vaccine.\n",
      "Balouyeva is all too familiar with the consequences that follow if you go against the school administration.\n",

      "CNN was given access by local authorities to one of Moscow's top public schools, where some measures -- like testing and teachers in facemasks -- have been implemented.\n",
      "But no one CNN spoke to at School 1363 said they had taken the vaccine, although theysay they will \"definitely\" do so soon. Deputy head Maria Zatolokina said: \"I think that every teacher understands how important it is to be safe and to create a safe environment for our students to be healthy. That's why I hope that we are responsible people, and we should [all] be vaccinated.\"\n",
      "Political pressure\n",
      "Critics such as Anastasia Vasilyeva, a Russian doctor turned prominent campaigner and ally of Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, says the country's push for a vaccine comes amid political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray Russia as a global scientific force. Navalny is currently being treated in a Berlin hospital after a suspected poisoning attempt in Siberia last month.\n",
      "\"I think it's to show Russia is a big strong country, that Putin is a big strong president,\" Vasilyeva told CNN.\n",
      "Her colleague, a surgeon at a hospital in northeast Moscow, shared his concerns about the vaccine with CNN, strictly on the condition of anonymity, due to fear of facing repercussions at work, if he came out publicly against the vaccine. When offered the vaccine in early August, he started consulting with experts.\n",
      "\"I am not a vaccine specialist,\" he admits, \"So, I called the doctors who deal with vaccinations, I called immunologists. They said, 'don't do it, by no means, the vaccine is raw.'\"\n",
      "It was a friendly offer, he says, no pressure, no obligations. But no matter how hard the deputy chief physician tried to persuade the surgeon that the vaccine is \"perfectly normal, good, amazing,\" the doctor still was reluctant to try it on himself.\n",
      "\"Explain to me: how could it be that such powerful European and international organizations could not do it, but a relatively small Gamaleya Institute could? I cannot understand it,\" the surgeon said.\n",
      "He didn't know when the vaccine would be delivered to his hospital but said very few of his colleagues would have the courage to refuse it.\n",
      "\"Totalitarianism remains [in Russia]. The two most helpless sectors are education and health care. Everything is done forcefully here. Last year I had a flu shot, everyone was told they needed to be vaccinated. And everyone did it, because if you don't, there will be penalties.\"\n",
      "But it isn't just doctors and teachers who voiced concerns Russia may have cut essential corners in development.\n",

      "(CNN) — When the British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca announced on Monday that its experimental coronavirus vaccine is 70% effective on average, the world exhaled a collective sigh of relief and stocks rallied. Another vaccine with promising results had arrived.\n",
      "But a lack of clarity surrounding several aspects of the data from the AstraZeneca vaccine trials have raised some eyebrows in the scientific community, potentially setting back the timing for the vaccine to be authorized in Europe and the US.\n",
      "AstraZeneca said on Monday that study participants in the UK had been given two different courses of the vaccine.\n",
      "The drugmaker, which developed the vaccine with the University of Oxford, did not however, at the time, explain why they used two different dosing regimens or why the size of one group was significantly smaller than the other.\n",
      "In one group, 2,741 participants received a half-dose of the vaccine and then a full dose at least a month later. This group was 90% protected against COVID-19.\n",
      "In the second group, 8,895 participants received a full dose followed by another full dose at least a month later. This group was only 62% protected.\n",
      "That's why AstraZeneca says their vaccine is 70% effective, on average.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "But some scientists are questioning why the company would report on a pooled result of two different trials, as it deviates from standard reporting on clinical trials.\n",
      "And in the days following that announcement, another point of confusion has emerged.\n",
      "On Tuesday, Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca's Executive Vice President who heads up non-oncology research and development, first explained to Reuters that a lab error was the reason why some volunteers had received a smaller dose -- the dose that proved to be 90% effective. \"The reason we had the half dose is serendipity,\" Pangalos said, adding that researchers had \"underpredicted the dose of the vaccine by half.\"\n",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, Oxford's communications manager for vaccines told CNN that \"dose selection for any new vaccine is a complicated area, and in exploring methods of dose selection, we discovered one gave a lower dose than expected.\"\n",
      "Oxford elaborated further on Thursday, saying in a statement to CNN that a \"difference in the manufacturing process\" had led to the error.\n",
      "That manufacturing problem has since been corrected, the statement said, noting that the UK regulator overseeing the trial had agreed to include \"both approaches\" in Phase 3.\n",
      "While AstraZeneca and Oxford face criticism about transparency -- given that they did not mention the error in their press release announcing the results nor on a press call on Monday -- the company believes the world should focus on the trial's positive results.\n",
      "Speaking to the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday, Menelas Pangalos AstraZeneca's Executive Vice-President said, \"The mistake is actually irrelevant.\n",
      "\"Whichever way you cut the data -- even if you only believe the full-dose, full-dose data... We still have efficacy that meets the thresholds for approval with a vaccine that's over 60% effective,\" Pangalos said, according to the WSJ.\n",
      "AstraZeneca and Oxford have yet to put forward a candidate for interview, as requested by CNN.\n",
      "The US Food and Drug Administration requires a threshold of at least 50% efficacy. It is not clear if the FDA will authorize emergency use however.\n",
      "AstraZeneca has not yet tested its half-strength dose in the US either. But on Thursday, a spokesperson for the company told CNN their aim was to include the half-strength dose regimen into their US trials, which currently has around 10,000 participants.\n",
      "The spokesperson said that the company hopes to recruit around 40,000 volunteers in total -- some of whom would receive the half-dose vaccine. They added that they were in \"ongoing discussions\" with the FDA for approval, adding that nothing formal had been announced.\n",
      "On Monday, Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee -- which will review COVID-19 vaccines before they are put on the market -- said the lack of data that led them to their conclusions made it \"hard to know the significance of their findings.\"\n",
      "When two other major drugmakers, Pfizer and Moderna, released their efficacy results earlier this month, they did include the data that led to their results.\n",
      "AstraZeneca presented an analysis of 23,000 participants in its Phase 3 trial.\n",
      "It said some participants received the COVID-19 vaccine, while others received a different vaccine for an unrelated virus, or placebo injections.\n",
      "A total of 131 study participants developed COVID-19, AstraZeneca said, but they did not say how many of those people had received the vaccine.\n",
      "What also remains unclear is why the two-dose regimes produced such different efficacy measures.\n",
      "The trial's lead investigator at Oxford, Professor Andrew Pollard told journalists on Monday that's likely to do with the delicate balance of dosing someone just enough to trigger an immune response against the disease.\n",
      "\"What we've always tried to do with a vaccine is fool the immune system into thinking that there's a dangerous infection there that it needs to respond to -- but doing it in a very safe way,\" Pollard explained.\n",
      "So, it may be that the best way of \"kicking the immune system into action\" could be to give the body a small amount of the vaccine to begin with -- and then follow up with a larger amount, he said.\n",
      "Responding to whether he had genuine confidence that the half-dose group's 90% success was not just a feature of a small sample size, Pollard said that result was \"highly significant...even with the numbers that we have.\"\n",
      "But experts are questioning whether those results will hold up if more people are given the lower-dose regime.\n",
      "In a call with reporters on Wednesday, the US vaccine czar Moncef Slaoui said they were reviewing AstraZeneca's vaccine data.\n",
      "He said that group that got the mistakenly lower dose that yielded the 90% efficacy had been a younger group, with no one older than 55. That could potentially affect the strength of AstraZeneca's findings, given that young people typically produce stronger immune responses to vaccines.\n",
      "Both Oxford and AstraZeneca told CNN on Thursday they were unable to give a breakdown of the ages of the people who were given the vaccine in that smaller group.\n",
      "An AstraZeneca spokesperson told CNN on Thursday that, \"given the high efficacy we have now seen with the different dosing regimens, there is strong merit in continuing to further investigate these findings in order to establish the most effective dosing regimen for the vaccine.\"\n",
      "He added that the company is having discussions with regulators around the world to evaluate the findings and that they are looking forward to the publication of peer-reviewed results.\n",
      "But Dr. Saad Omer, a vaccine specialist at the Yale School of Medicine believes the group with the 90% efficacy rate is relatively small and the results may not stand up when more people are given this regimen.\n",
      "\"I hate to criticize fellow academics, or anyone for that matter,\" he said, \"but releasing information like this is like asking us to try and read the tea leaves.\"\n",
      "On Wednesday, AstraZeneca's stock fell more than 6%.\n",

      "Every step in the production process had to be carefully designed and calibrated, including vast water filtration systems, to mass-produce the brand-new vaccine.\n",
      "\"In principle, the process of manufacturing was known on a small, lab-scale, but making it on a large industrial scale is another universe,\" Dmitry Poteryaev, chief science officer at Generium told CNN.\n",
      "\"You cannot simply go from one liter of bioreactor to 100 liters or 1000 or 1 ton of bioreactor. Every process is different, the oxygenation is different, the mass balance is different,\" he explained.\n",
      "He said those problems had been overcome several months ago and the factory was now ready to step up production further.\n",

Every vial has its own unique QR code, we are told, so it can be traced to individual patients no matter where in the world they are.\n",
      "The vaccine has become one of the world's most preordered, with at least 30 countries, from Argentina to the Philippines, signing contracts for nearly 2.5 billion doses so far, according to figures from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which is responsible for global production and distribution of the vaccine.\n",

      "This is a country with one of the highest numbers of COVID-19 infections in the world -- more than 4.1 million cases and counting. But it also has one of the world's highest rates of vaccine hesitancy. One recent opinion poll, published by the independent Levada Center, indicated just 38% of Russians are willing to be vaccinated.\n",
      "Earlier this month, one of the key scientists behind the development of the vaccine said about 2.2 million people -- less than 2% of the Russian population -- have received at least the initial dose of the two-shot regimen.\n",

Critics say \"Putin's vaccine\" was designed to be another first in a global race, to project Kremlin power, regardless of how effective or safe it was.\n",
      "But the results of large-scale human trials, published and peer-reviewed in the prestigious Lancet medical journal earlier this month showed an impressive 91.6% efficacy for the vaccine.\n",

      "Another reason for doubt may be that while President Vladimir Putin said his daughter was vaccinated, he has yet to take the shot.\n",
      "The Kremlin has brushed off questions as to why, saying Putin has a vaccine scheduled, and that when he eventually gets inoculated, the nation will be informed.\n",
      "But in a country where many people look to the Kremlin strongman for his lead, his abstinence on the Sputnik V front is notable and discouraging.\n",
      "Ice cream incentives\n",
      "All adults with no underlying health conditions in Russia are now eligible for a free vaccination. But progress in Moscow, for instance, is painfully slow. In a city of more than 12 million people, fewer than 600,000 have been vaccinated so far, according to Mayor Sergey Sobyanin.\n",

      "\"In emergency use, we now have used it on nearly a million people. We have not received any reports of serious adverse reaction, and only a few have some mild symptoms,\" Liu said.\n",
      "Liu said the vaccine had been given to Chinese construction workers, diplomats, and students who have gone to more than 150 countries around the world during the pandemic -- and none of them has reported an infection.\n",
      "He said on November 6 that there were 56,000 people who had received emergency vaccinations and then gone overseas.\n",
      "\"For example, a transnational company has 99 employees in one of its overseas offices, of whom 81 were vaccinated. And later, an outbreak broke out in the office, 10 of the 18 people who were not vaccinated were infected and none of those vaccinated were infected,\" he said.\n",
      "He said that separately, Sinopharm had carried out Phase 3 clinical trials involving almost 60,000 people in 10 countries -- including the UAE, Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Peru, and Argentina. CNN has not seen the results of these trials yet.\n",
      "Sinopharm has two vaccine candidates. It's unclear which vaccine Liu referred to.\n",
      "Beijing has granted approval to companies for urgent vaccinations using experimental drugs for months. In June, Chinese company CanSino Biologics announced it had been given special authorization to administer its experimental vaccine to the People's Liberation Army.\n",
      "Since July, Chinese drug makers have been administering experimental vaccines to people working in \"high-risk\" professions under the emergency use program, which allows vaccine candidates to be used on a limited scale before their safety and efficacy have been fully proven by clinical trials.\n",

      "(CNN) — An Australian produced coronavirus vaccine candidate has been scrapped after trial participants returned false positive test results for HIV, developers announced Friday.\n",
      "The inoculation, which had yet to progress beyond Phase 1 trials, was being jointly developed by the University of Queensland and Australian biotech company CSL. Australia had hoped the vaccine would be available by mid-2021.\n",
      "In a statement, CSL said that no serious adverse effects had been reported in the 216 trial participants, and the vaccine was shown to have a \"strong safety profile.\" However trial data revealed that antibodies generated by the vaccine interfered with HIV diagnosis and led to false positives on some HIV tests, CSL said.\n",
      "If the vaccine was rolled out nationally, CSL said it could undermine public health in Australia by causing a wave of false positive HIV tests in the community.\n",
      "\"Follow up tests confirmed that there is no HIV virus present, just a false positive on certain HIV tests. There is no possibility the vaccine causes infection,\" the statement added.\n",
      "Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters on Friday morning that the vaccine \"will no longer feature as part of the country's vaccine plan.\" Australia had pre-emptively ordered 51 million doses of the CSL vaccine in October.\n",
      "Morrison said that Australia had backed four vaccines that showed promise but \"at no stage ... believed that all four of those vaccines would likely get through that process.\"\n",

      "Australian Minister for Health Greg Hunt said that following the announcement, Australia would be ordering an extra 20 million units from AstraZeneca and 11 million from Novovax.\n",
      "A vaccine has to pass through three stages of trials before it can then be considered for approval for public use. Australia has yet to grant approval to a coronavirus vaccine candidate.\n",
      "Adam Taylor, early career research leader in emerging viruses at Griffith University's Menzies Health Institute, said in an emailed statement that the false positive HIV results were a result of the technology used to create the vaccine.\n",
      "\"The (vaccine's) molecular clamp is made from a HIV protein, which on its own is harmless. The molecular clamp stabilizes the coronavirus spike protein and presents it to the body in a way that promotes a good immune response. This is why the clamp technology is so vital,\" Taylor said.\n",
      "He added that the clamp model vaccine had shown \"good safety and immune response\" against the coronavirus in early clinical trials, and the possibility for generating an HIV positive result had been thought to be low.\n",
      "Some Australian health experts have praised the University of Queensland researchers for ending the trial when they did. \"Although it might seem counter-intuitive, from a research ethics viewpoint, this is a success,\" said Diego Silva, an health ethics expert at the University of Sydney School of Public Health, in an emailed statement.\n",

      "Vaccines, especially, attracts myths and rumors and coronavirus vaccines seems to be fiction magnets.\n",
      "Here are a few of the more common ones:\n",
      "The COVID-19 vaccines were too rushed. We cannot know if they are safe.\n",
      "It's true the vaccines being produced against coronavirus were created in record time. But that's not because they were rushed. It's because of careful preparation. The technology that underlies both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines -- the first two to get through the US regulatory process -- has been in the works for more than a decade and was made precisely for a pandemic situation.\n",
      "This plug-and-play technology needs only the genetic code of a new virus, and that was available just days after the new coronavirus was identified and isolated.\n",
      "Vaccines are usually slow to develop because -- contrary to popular belief -- they are not big money makers for pharmaceutical companies, so production doesn't ramp up unless there is a guaranteed market. In this case, the United States government paid billions up front so the companies would feel secure in going ahead and making vaccines at the same time they started the months-long process of clinical trials.\n",
      "These trials went speedily because of the pandemic itself. So many people were getting infected across the country that it did not take long at all to tell whether the vaccine could protect people from infection. In addition, the hospitals and academic labs that did the testing sped up their own processes, fling paperwork daily, for instance, instead of waiting for weeks to file it in batches. And the US Food and Drug Administration scientists who reviewed the data worked seven days a week to review the information, dropping everything else to speed along their decisions.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "The companies themselves submit to outside experts called Data and Safety Monitoring Boards while the trials are ongoing.\n",
      "Finally, the review was subject to outside eyes. The FDA submitted all the data to the independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, a group of mostly non-government, non-industry experts who reviewed the data. They overwhelmingly voted that both the Pfizer/BioNtech and Moderna vaccines are as effective and as safe as the companies who made them say they are.\n",
      "Anyone who wants to can see the data. It's posted online, and was published in the New England Journal of Medicine for any expert to review and critique.\n",
      "People who have allergies can't get the vaccines\n",
      "It's true that people who have allergies to the specific ingredients in these vaccines should not get them. But that is a pretty short list, and might include ingredients such as polyethylene glycol. \n",
      "Old-fashioned flu vaccines are grown in eggs and some people with egg allergies were warned against getting some flu vaccine formulations -- but even flu vaccines have been reformulated in recent years and many are egg-free. The coronavirus vaccines are not made using eggs. They also do not contain preservatives that might trigger allergies.\n",
      "\"Honestly, anaphylaxis and other serious allergic reactions are considered a potential risk with every licensed vaccine,\" said Dr. Elissa Malkin, assistant research professor of Medicine at the George Washington University and a co-investigator on the Moderna vaccine clinical trial at GW.\n",
      "\"It is not surprising that as more people get vaccinated that allergic reactions would appear. We expect them to be uncommon and rare,\" Malkin told CNN.\n",
      "No allergic reactions were seen in the clinical trials of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, which involved just under 80,000 people. As they are rolled out among millions of people, more are likely to be seen, however.\n",
      "One health worker who suffered an allergic reaction in Fairbanks, Alaska on Friday issued a statement saying she would be vaccinated again. \"Anaphylaxis is a rare but expected potential side effect that is treatable and does not have long term health implications like Covid,\" she said.\n",
      "I would get the vaccine and recommend it to anyone, despite my reaction,\" she added.\n",
      "\"I've seen firsthand the suffering and death of COVID patients and my adverse reaction to the vaccine pales to what Covid infection can do to people.\"\n",
      "The vaccine will permanently change your DNA\n",
      "This rumor may have started because the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines both use genetic material. But they don't change DNA. They use RNA, which doesn't hang around in the body.\n",
      "Former US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Tom Frieden came up with this analogy:\n",
      "\"An mRNA vaccine doesn't actually contain the virus itself. Think of it as an email sent to your immune system that shows what the virus looks like, instructions to kill it, and then—like a Snapchat message—it disappears. Amazing technology,\" Frieden tweeted.\n",
      "The vaccine is more dangerous than COVID-19\n",
      "Brown University emergency room doctor Dr. Megan Ranney took this one on. She noted that at least 1% of people who catch coronavirus die of it. \"Another 10-20% are hospitalized. Another 30% or more have long lasting symptoms. The vaccine is far safer, with only minor temporary side effects,\" Ranney said on Twitter.\n",
      "In both Pfizer and Moderna's vaccine trials, no worrying side-effects were seen. Covid-19 has killed more than 313,000 Americans -- more than 1.67 million people globally, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n",
      "Coronavirus is just a myth\n",
      "If it's a conspiracy, it's a good one. Tens of thousands of doctors and nurses around the world must be colluding in this lie. Every single government, the United Nations, the World Health Organization, the CDC and countless other organizations must be in on it.\n",

      "“Iba-ibang pathways ang aming dinadaanan dito. Unang-una, andun yung ating mga ineexplore na collaboration agreements for clinical trials with institutions that are leading in the development and coming from countries with bilateral agreements on science and technology, research and development,” dela Peña said.\n",
      "[TRANSLATION: We are using different pathways here. First, there are collaboration agreements we are exploring for clinical trials with institutions…”]\n",
      "Dela Peña said some of the countries their group is having discussions with are China, India, Japan, Canada, and the United States – this is aside from their meetings with Russia, which recently offered their vaccine to the Philippines. Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev reiterated that there is “nothing to hide” about the Sputnik-V coronavirus jab, saying data is available about the vaccine.\n",
      "READ: Russia has nothing to hide about Sputnik V, says envoy\n",
      "Sec. Dela Peña also said clinical trials for Sputnik-V will commence in October and may end by May of 2021 – same as the earliest date Malacañang announced earlier this week about how soon President Rodrigo Duterte can get vaccinated with the Gamaleya Institute-made vaccine.\n",
      "“Mahaba-habang proseso dahil iaanalyze pa ng experts dito yung data na ibinibigay nila bago tayong magsimula ng clinical trials,” Dela Peña said.\n",
      "[TRANSLATION: This will be a long process because experts will analyze the data they (Russia) will give before we start clinical trials.]\n",
      "The secretary also said the vaccine will have to be approved by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration or FDA before it can be used.\n",
      "In the meantime, the DOST is also waiting on the final list of vaccines from the World Health Organization which would be used for trials in the Philippines.\n",
      "Six vaccines from China, the US, and the UK are currently in the third stage of clinical trials.\n",
      "Dela Peña said three hospitals have been eyed for vaccine trials: the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and Manila Doctor’s Hospital – both in the nation’s capital, and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, also the Philippines’ premier coronavirus testing facility.\n",
