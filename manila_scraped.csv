C.: United States President Joe Biden’s massive relief plan is on track to cross the finish line on Wednesday (Thursday in Manila) with a final House vote, stimulating an economy digging out from the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic and offering a lifeline for millions of families. The $1.9-trillion package, broadly popular with Americans and approved by the Senate over the weekend, is expected to narrowly clear Congress days before a crucial deadline, culminating a weeks-long negotiation over its cost and scope. If it reaches his desk, Biden — who made the American Rescue Plan his top legislative priority — could sign the historic bill into law by week’s end. But the plan that funds Covid-19 vaccines, preserves unemployment benefits for millions, and sends relief checks of up to $1,400 to most Americans can afford very few Democratic defections. All Republicans are in lockstep against the package, and Democrats enjoy the smallest majority in years in the 435-seat House of Representatives. A Tuesday vote laying out the parameters of the next day’s action on the bill augured its narrow path to success. The tally was 219 to 210 in favor of proceeding, with no
Republicans in support and one Democrat joining their party in opposition. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said he was “110 percent” confident the bill will pass. In an effort to drive home how this sweeping package helps the economy, Biden on Tuesday visited a business billed as Washington’s oldest hardware store, which has benefitted from the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) begun under Donald Trump’s administration to help businesses stay afloat during the crisis. “We’re going to continue this,” Biden said of the PPP as he chatted with store owner Mike Siegel. The president took a jab at Trump, though, saying that “a lot of money went to people who shouldn’t have gotten help” through the PPP because some of the beneficiary companies were too large and therefore not supposed to qualify. Biden’s administration will tailor the program so that it focuses on businesses with 20 employees or fewer, he said. Left-wing Sen. Bernie Sanders tweeted “Finally, our government is responding to the pain of working people.” The last congressional plan to fight the coronavirus, which has to date left more than 527,000 dead in the United States and brought the economy to its knees, was enacted in December. It expanded unemployment payments by $300 a week, and extended them through March 14. That deadline has loomed as Biden and congressional Democrats crafted their latest package, but it appears they will meet it and extend the benefits until early September. “It’s a remarkable, historic, transformative piece of legislation which goes a very long way to crushing the virus and solving our economic crisis,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters."

Debold Sinas on Wednesday directed all police units to strictly enforce public health guidelines amid the rising cases of Covid-19. The PNP chief also appealed to the public anew for greater awareness and cooperation in the implementation and observance of health protocols. “We cannot afford to lower our guard against the virus, especially at this point when the cure is already within reach,” Sinas said. He added that the police force “will remain vigilant in enforcing public health guidelines and local ordinances that seek to mitigate the effects of the pandemic that has so far infected 600,000 Filipinos, 12,000 of whom have died due to medical complications.” Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros, meanwhile, rejected the proposal to deploy military and police personnel to arrest individuals who breach health protocols. The senator deplored “the militaristic approach” to the pandemic, saying it was “a repeat of the mistakes of the past.” She said it would only delay the swift response needed to deal with the rise in cases which the World Health Organization (WHO) said might require the country to return to a stricter lockdown like in July 2020. “What is this, throwback to 2020?” asked Hontiveros. She noted that during the world’s longest lockdown, police arrested 76,000 people for breaching health protocols from March to July last year. “The cases did not go down and only overwhelmed health workers that they had to beg for a 2-week circuit-breaker,” the senator said in a statement. She lamented that deploying uniformed personnel was an ineffective and anti-poor strategy. She cited the case of the five youths arrested in Laguna at the start of the lockdown who were detained in a dog cage. “There is a way to enforce stricter health protocols humanely and non-violently. It’s 2021 already. Let’s do this the right way,” Hontiveros said. Sen. Panfilo Lacson, on the other hand, said civilians should also do their part “by cooperating with lawful instructions and following the proper health protocols.” “This is the key to minimizing the spread of the coronavirus. We are under a state of public health emergency by virtue of Presidential Proclamation 922,” Lacson said. “The country is still struggling to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, there is a noticeable spike in the past few days, and the government must use its police power under the Constitution to make sure that the further spread of the virus is prevented or controlled,” he added.

He urged the LGUs to each pass an ordinance penalizing the violators. Malaya said the DILG deployed 180 policemen in Pasay City, reportedly experiencing a surge in virus cases, to enforce health and safety protocols to stop Covid-19 from fanning out. On a positive note, the majority of adult Filipinos tend to use masks and face shields to avoid contracting Covid-19, while some only practice physical distancing and staying at home for the same reason.

WHO Country Representative Rabindra Abeyasinghe. PHOTO BY J. GERARD SEGUIA According to WHO Country Representative Dr. Rabindra Abeyasinghe, the LGUs should lead in the effort on early detection, quarantine and granular lockdowns to prevent increase in cases that may lead to a regional community lockdown just like last year. “We need to go back to ensuring that public- health measures are fully implemented and that the authorities fully implement the early detection, early quarantining, isolation of cases and, if necessary, limited lockdowns in [villages] with clustering of such cases to prevent further spread,” Abeyasinghe said in a news briefing on Tuesday. The Department of Health (DoH) on Monday blamed an increase in the number of cases in the country on the public’s noncompliance with the minimum health standards, an uptick that was aggravated by the presence of the B117 or the United Kingdom variant and the B1351 or the South African variant of the virus. Both variants have higher transmission rates and, in the case of the South African variant, may affect the efficacy of vaccines being rolled out globally. Abeyasinghe said the WHO is carefully monitoring the variants that have spread across the globe by working with different research institutions to understand how they act. He added that the current increase in the number of cases does not constitute a “second wave” of infection, as the region did not experience a true “flattening of the curve” or a decrease in the number of cases specifically in the National Capital Region (NCR or Metro Manila). “I would not classify this as a second wave… We should have seen a flattening of the curve and in the case of NCR, we did not see a flattening. We always knew that there is a thick chain of transmission although the numbers went down…. [there] were still significant
levels of transmission in the community,” Abeyasinghe said. He added that determination of community transmission of the variants is not possible because of the limited number of variants and that the testing for the variants remains expensive. “The number of variants confirmed is limited…. With limited testing for variants being done, the key issue is interpreting the findings and doing representative sampling and that is what we are doing with the DoH to strengthen, as it is not possible in an economic standpoint variant genome sequencing for every Covid patient,” Abeyasinghe said. On Tuesday, the country logged 2,668 new cases of Covid-19, pushing the total number of infections to 600,428."

The Philippines earlier received 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines from the World Health Organization-led Covax Facility. The vaccines developed by Novavax and AstraZeneca are being manufactured by Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer. An early data readout in January from its United Kingdom trial showed the vaccine to be around 96 percent effective against the original coronavirus and around 86 percent effective against the now widely circulating variant first discovered in Britain. Novavax completed enrollment of its 30,000-subject, US-based trial in February. Meanwhile, Roque said the government has signed a purchase order for 1 million doses from China’s Sinovac Biotech and a supply agreement for 13 million doses from another American drugmaker, Moderna Inc., which would add to the country’s Covid-19 vaccine supply. This is aside from 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines that were donated by the Chinese government and arrived in the country last week.

Those who are fully vaccinated can also visit with unvaccinated people from one other household indoors without masks or distancing so long as the unvaccinated people are not at high risk for severe Covid-19, added CDC Director Rochelle Walensky. Fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who has Covid-19 also won’t need to take a test or quarantine unless they show symptoms — unless they live in a congregate setting like a nursing home or correctional facility. The recommendations came as US states were moving to reopen schools and businesses amid a drop in cases. Some 59 million Americans have now received one or more vaccine doses — about 23 percent of the adult population — and the immunization rate has been steadily rising after a shaky start. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a two-dose series, like the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two weeks after a single-dose vaccine like Johnson & Johnson’s. Two women wearing face masks as a protection against the coronavirus disease take a selfie during snowfall in central Moscow on March 8, 2021. AFP PHOTO While the new guidance will come as welcome news, particularly for the elderly who are now free to visit with their healthy children and grandchildren, many restrictions have not changed. The CDC continues to recommend that fully-vaccinated people wear masks and maintain social distancing in public, or in indoor gatherings involving people from more than one household. And the new guidance does not apply to meetings with people who have underlying conditions that place them at higher risk for severe Covid. The health agency also continues to recommend against attending larger gatherings and advises against domestic or foreign travel. Scientists are now very confident that authorized Covid vaccines protect people against severe disease and death. There is also growing evidence that they stop infections — though probably not at the same rate as they stop disease — but more research is needed to get a firmer idea.  "

Mayor Benjamin Magalong, who recently called a meeting facilitated by concerned city government divisions said among the measures were for the companies to maintain strict adherence to health and safety protocols in all their activities. The companies were advised to revisit their safety measures and to adjust and innovate where it is needed to make them more apt and effective. They were also advised to adopt a moratorium on social activities. Moreover, the city sought more cooperation on their part in contact tracing operations even with the existence of their own CT teams. Testing will also be done using pooled methods and antigen while quarantine protocols will be improved to be more effective. It was also agreed that the companies will be subjected to random and surprise inspection by the city sanitation team. Other key agreements were for the call center companies to update their human resource database and to have their employees register with StaySafe and Baguio in my Pocket applications for easier contact tracing. Compliance with all the accords will be monitored by the City Mayor’s Office through the Permits and Licensing Division and the Management Information Technology Division and the City Health Services Office through the Sanitation Division.

Calalo,"March 6, 2021","Metro LGUs lauded for fast rollout of, increased confidence in vaccines of health workers","METRO Manila’s local government units (LGUs) have effectively and swiftly carried out the rollout and deployment of vaccines in their respective hospitals that led to increased confidence among medical frontliners. Undersecretary Bernardo Florece Jr., officer-in-charge of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), said in a statement that the LGUs’ preparation in coordination with the Department of Health (DoH) and compliance with the national deployment and vaccination plan played a key role in the success of the start of the roll-out. “A few days since the vaccination program began, we have seen the significant increase in vaccine confidence among health care workers with some hospitals even running out of stocks,” Florece said. “The local hospitals conducted town halls among their medical workers, conducted simulations, and did an inventory of their resources, so when the roll-out began, they were prepared and there were generally no hitches,” the DILG acting secretary added. Congratulating the LGUs for the good start, Florece said that the greater challenge will come in the next few months when inoculations will begin among the senior citizens and indigent groups. “But the LGUs have shown that it can be done properly and fast,” he said. LGU hospitals that were the first batch to begin inoculation include Pasig City General Hospital, San Ana Hospital, Pasay City General Hospital, Quezon City General Hospital, Taguig-Pateros District Hospital, Ospital ng Muntinlupa, Tondo Medical Center, Valenzuela Medical Center and Ospital ng Makati. In Parañaque City, the vaccination rollout commenced last Friday as 50 health workers from the Ospital ng Parañaque received their first dose of CoronaVac, the vaccine manufactured by China’s Sinovac Biotech. Among the first to get the jabs were hospital director Dr. Jefferson Pagsisihan and Parañaque’s chief of clinics Dr. Patrick Ismael Dela Cruz 2. Malabon City also started its vaccination rollout at the Ospital ng Malabon (OsMal) and the first to be vaccinated was OsMal chief Dr. Mitzi Tanchoco. Health workers in Caloocan City also got their jabs of Sinovac’s Covid-19 vaccine as the vaccination rollout commenced at the Caloocan City Medical Center where a total of 149 health workers agreed to get vaccinated. In Makati City, the local government said that its 300 doses of Sinovac vaccine were all administered to health workers of the Ospital ng Makati (OsMak) with the hospital director, Dr. Vergel Binay, being the first health worker to be administered the vaccine. Mandaluyong City Medical Center, Navotas City Hospital, Novaliches District Hospital, San Juan Medical Center have also begun their inoculations. All Level 3 and Level 2 LGU Hospitals in Metro Manila have also begun the vaccination rollout among health care workers, the DILG said."

Valente, TMT","March 6, 2021","Galvez: Covid-19 vaccines delivered in March, April still for health workers","IN a bid to protect and preserve the country’s health care system amid the health crisis, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. assured the public that all jabs for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) to be delivered this March and April would be “specifically allocated” to health care workers. In a statement, Galvez said the government would prioritize health workers in its vaccination efforts until two million of them have received shots to protect them from the virus. “All vaccine supplies that we have received and will be delivered this month are specifically allocated to all health care workers from all regions across the country,” Galvez said. “Initial deliveries for April will also follow this allocation until we have completely inoculated nearly two million individuals under this sector,” he added. Galvez made the statement as he assured the public that the priority framework of the vaccination rollout of the Covid-19 jabs would be strictly followed. He explained that due to the limited supply of vaccines and recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, along with the directive of President Rodrigo Duterte, the allocation of Covid-19 jabs should follow the priority framework issued by the country’s inter-agency task force focused on the coronavirus response. “The framework prioritizes medical frontliners and healthcare workers to be followed by our senior citizens and other sectors. This prioritization primarily ensures that we will be able to protect and preserve our healthcare system as we continue to battle this pandemic,” he said. Galvez said the prioritization of health care workers was emphasized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of the Philippines’ agreement in procuring 44 million doses of Covid-19 shots from the Covax Facility, an initiative focused to provide equitable access to vaccines and which the agency is a leader of. On Thursday, a total of 487,200 doses of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca arrived in the country. The WHO said that 4.5 million doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine would arrive in the country in batches before the end of May. “All the doses from Covax must first be administered to the agreed upon priority groups starting with health care workers . Giving the vaccines to other sectors when not all health care workers have been vaccinated will jeopardize succeeding deliveries from Covax,” Galvez said. Succeeding sectors in the priority list, including those who will participate in boosting public trust in the vaccination campaign, will be served once the country receives the vaccine supplies for the second and third quarters of the year, according to Galvez. “We remind our countrymen especially our co-workers in government that in these trying times, it is our moral obligation to ensure that our healthcare system is protected and will be able to withstand possible spikes in Covid-19 cases,” Galvez said. “By respecting and following the priority framework, we will be able to reduce Covid-19 morbidity and mortality, protect the populations most at-risk to the disease, slow down the transmission rate, and minimize social and economic disruptions. We need to preserve our healthcare institution,” he added. Galvez thanked government officials, civil society organizations, and other personalities for volunteering to get inoculated in public to boost the people’s trust and confidence in the Covid-19 vaccination campaign. “We value your support and appreciate your intention to help us boost the people’s confidence in the vaccines even as volunteering to take the jab in public,” the vaccine czar said. “Indeed, seeing our leaders getting inoculated will significantly affect the perception and decision of our countrymen on the vaccine program,” he added. Amid the continued rise in coronavirus cases, the government is targeting to give free inoculations to 70 million Filipinos to reach herd immunity. Meanwhile, one million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from Sinovac that the Philippines purchased will arrive in the third week of March. The Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer under the Covax facility may arrive in the country in April. The first batch of 20 million doses of Moderna Covid-19 vaccines will arrive in the Philippines by June."

REUTERS posted on March 3 a must-read report on the pandemic that surveys how virus variants are impacting the views of scientists on Covid-19, and the vaccine rollout in various countries. As reported by Julie Steenhuysen and Kate Kelland, Reuters provides a revealing update on the battle between scientists and SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. I reproduce their report in full: “Chris Murray, a University of Washington disease expert whose projections on Covid-19 infections and deaths are closely followed worldwide, is changing his assumptions about the course of the pandemic. “Murray had, until recently, been hopeful that the discovery of several effective vaccines could help countries achieve herd immunity, or nearly eliminate transmission through a combination of inoculation and previous infection. But in the last month, data from a vaccine trial in South Africa showed not only that a rapidly spreading coronavirus variant could dampen the effect of the vaccine, [but] it could also evade natural immunity in people who had been previously infected. “‘I couldn’t sleep’ after seeing the data, Murray, director of the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told Reuters. ‘When will it end?’ he asked himself, referring to the pandemic. He is currently updating his model to account for variants’ ability to escape natural immunity and expects to provide new projections as early as this week. New consensus
“A new consensus is emerging among scientists, according to Reuters interviews with 18 specialists who closely track the pandemic or are working to curb its impact. Many described how the breakthrough late last year of two vaccines with around 95 percent efficacy against Covid-19 had initially sparked hope that the virus could be largely contained, similar to the way measles has been. “But, they say, data in recent weeks on new variants from South Africa and Brazil have undercut that optimism. They now believe that SARS-CoV-2 will not only remain with us as an endemic virus, continuing to circulate in communities, but will likely cause a significant burden of illness and death for years to come. “As a result, the scientists said, people could expect to continue to take measures such as routine mask-wearing and avoiding crowded places during Covid-19 surges, especially for people at high risk. “Even after vaccination, ‘I still would want to wear a mask if there was a variant out there,’ Dr. Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to US President Joe Biden, said in an interview. ‘All you need is one little flick of a variant (sparking) another surge, and there goes your prediction’ about when life gets back to normal. “Some scientists, including Murray, acknowledge that the outlook could improve. The new vaccines, which have been developed at record speed, still appear to prevent hospitalizations and death even when new variants are the cause of infection. Many vaccine developers are working on booster shots and new inoculations that could preserve a high level of efficacy against the variants. And scientists say there is still much to be learned about the immune system’s ability to combat the virus. “Already, Covid-19 infection rates have declined in many countries since the start of 2021, with some dramatic reductions in severe illness and hospitalizations among the first groups of people to be vaccinated. Worse than flu
“Murray said if the South African variant, or similar mutants, continue to spread rapidly, the number of Covid-19 cases resulting in hospitalization or death this coming winter could be four times higher than the flu. The rough estimate assumes a 65 percent effective vaccine given to half of a country’s population. In a worst-case scenario, that could represent as many as 200,000 US deaths related to Covid-19 over the winter period, based on federal government estimates of annual flu fatalities. “His institute’s current forecast, which runs to June 1, assumes there will be an additional 62,000 US deaths and 690,000 global deaths from Covid-19 by that point. The model includes assumptions about vaccination rates as well as the transmissibility of the South African and Brazilian variants. “The shift in thinking among scientists has influenced more cautious government statements about when the pandemic will end. Britain last week said it expects a slow emergence from one of the world’s strictest lockdowns, despite having one of the fastest vaccination drives. “US government predictions of a return to a more normal lifestyle have been repeatedly pushed back, most recently from late summer to Christmas, and then to March 2022. Israel issues “Green Pass” immunity documents to people who have recovered from Covid-19 or been vaccinated, allowing them back into hotels or theaters. The documents are only valid for six months because it’s not clear how long immunity will last. “‘What does it mean to be past the emergency phase of this pandemic?’ said Stefan Baral, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. While some experts have asked whether countries could completely eradicate any case of Covid-19 through vaccines and stringent lockdowns, Baral sees the goals as more modest, but still meaningful. ‘In my mind, it’s that hospitals aren’t full, the ICUs aren’t full, and people aren’t tragically passing,’ he said. Scientific whiplash
“From the beginning, the new coronavirus has been a moving target. “Early in the pandemic, leading scientists warned that the virus could become endemic and ‘may never go away,’ including Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program. “Yet they had much to learn, including whether it would be possible to develop a vaccine against the virus and how quickly it would mutate. Would it be more like measles, which can be kept almost entirely at bay in communities with high rates of inoculation, or flu, which infects millions globally each year? “For much of 2020, many scientists were surprised and reassured that the coronavirus had not changed significantly enough to become more transmissible, or deadly. “A major breakthrough came in November 2020. Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE as well as Moderna Inc said their vaccines were around 95 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 in clinical trials, an efficacy rate that is much higher than any flu shot. “At least a few of the scientists Reuters interviewed said even in the wake of those results, they hadn’t expected the vaccines to wipe out the virus. But many told Reuters that the data raised hope within the scientific community that it would be possible to virtually eliminate Covid-19, if only the world could be vaccinated quickly enough. “‘We all felt quite optimistic before Christmas with those first vaccines,’ said Azra Ghani, chair in infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London. ‘We didn’t necessarily expect such high-efficacy vaccines to be possible in that first generation.’ “The optimism proved short-lived. In late December, the UK warned of a new, more transmissible variant that was quickly becoming the dominant form of the coronavirus in the country. Around the same time, researchers learned of the impact of the faster-spreading variants in South Africa and in Brazil. “Phil Dormitzer, a top vaccine scientist at Pfizer, told Reuters in November that the US drugmaker’s vaccine success signaled the virus was ‘vulnerable to immunization’ in what he called ‘a breakthrough for humanity.’ By early January, he acknowledged the variants heralded ‘a new chapter’ in which companies will have to constantly monitor for mutations that could dampen the effect of vaccines. “In late January, the impact on vaccines became even clearer. Novavax’s clinical trial data showed its vaccine was 89 percent effective in a UK trial, but just 50 percent effective at preventing Covid-19 in South Africa. That was followed a week later by data showing the AstraZeneca PLC vaccine offered only limited protection from mild disease against the South African variant. “The most recent change of heart was considerable, several of the scientists told Reuters. Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in San Diego, described it as ‘scientific whiplash’: In December, he had believed it was plausible to achieve so-called ‘functional eradication’ of the coronavirus, similar to measles. “Now, ‘getting as many people vaccinated as possible is still the same answer and the same path forward as it was on December 1 or January 1,’ Crotty said, ‘but the expected outcome isn’t the same.’” My only comment on this is that the cost of vaccinating 50 to 70 percent of a country’s population is unrealistic and prohibitive, particularly if its economy has been shattered by the pandemic and the lockdowns. Vaccinating all humanity must wait until pharmaceutical companies can produce as many vaccines as there are people. Economists must take the field as resolutely as the scientists. yenobserver@gmail.com"

The vials were the first batch of vaccines that were delivered by the military outside the National Capital Region (NCR), according to Sobejana. About 100 of the 300 medical personnel assigned to the 4ID were expected to be inoculated during the ceremonial vaccination. “We in the Armed Forces especially recognize how significant a progress the vaccination program is in the fight against Covid-19 not only for our troops, who have been serving as frontliners alongside our medical health workers, but most importantly for the needed protection of our fellow Filipinos in highly-vulnerable conditions,” Sobejana said. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases Vaccine Czar Carlito Galvez Jr. also witnessed the event at the 4ID gymnasium. They were joined by representatives from the Department of Health (DoH) and senior military officials. Colonel Jonna Dalaguit, Camp Evangelista Station Hospital (CESH) commanding officer, will head the vaccination campaign for military health workers assigned to the unit, the AFP said. “Because of the tireless effort and perseverance of our public officials from various government sectors, this day became possible for us to come together and witness the arrival of the much-awaited vaccine against the coronavirus,” according to the AFP chief. He said that the AFP was planning distributions to other areas outside Metro Manila through its land, air and naval assets. This is being coordinated with the DoH with regard to the protocol on handling and storage of vaccines, Sobejana said. “We are one with the government and the Health Department in the full force implementation of the National Vaccine Deployment Program. I am urging all members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to join this effort so that we will be able to convey to our people the need for their cooperation in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” Sobejana said."

I stared at Martin Luther King Jr.’s simple monument in awe, and began to recall his legacy. Michael King Jr.
He was born Michael King Jr. on Jan. 15, 1929 in Atlanta and was assassinated on April 4, 1968 in Memphis. As a Baptist minister and social activist, he led the US civil rights movement from the mid-1950s to 1968. In 1964, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. While in a Connecticut tobacco farm, he saw that the races peacefully mixed in the North. In the South, racial segregation was the norm. He wrote to his parents, “Negroes and whites go to the same church. I never thought that a person of my race could eat anywhere.” On Dec. 1, 1955 in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks refused to surrender her bus seat to a white passenger. Parks was arrested for violating the segregation law. King called for the boycott of the transit system. In 1963, he landed in the Birmingham jail for leading more protests. On Aug. 28, 1963, he made his iconic “I Have a Dream” speech in a peaceful interracial assembly of some 250,000 people in front of the Lincoln Memorial. In another protest, King also said, “We may have all come on different ships, but we’re in the same boat now.” King was not the first to say that. America’s 30th President, from 1923 to 1929, once said, “No matter by what various crafts we came here, we are all now in the same boat.” The same boat
Germany and the United Kingdom were at War in Europe. When Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill said to US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, “Now that we are, as you say, ‘in the same boat,’ would it not be wise for us to have another conference … and the sooner the better?” Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, I’ve been hearing public officials say that “we are all in the same boat.” Now, I am not sure if that is true. Gillian Tett wrote in the Financial Times, “The cruelty of Covid-19 is that it has not just exposed existing inequalities, but that it is exacerbating them, too.” Tett also wrote about “the three Bs” among people these days – boredom, burnout, and breakdown. But if you look on the positive side, there is a fourth B – blessings. The pandemic has helped increase fortune for a few, and misfortune for many. In 2013, French economist Thomas Piketty wrote a best-selling book, “Capital in the Twenty-First Century.” He referred to capital as the “sum total of non-human assets” that can be owned or exchanged. He argues that “when the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income … capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities.” Piketty’s theory explains what’s unfolding before our eyes during this pandemic. Because of existing monetary policies all over the world, people who hold assets have increased their net worth. Those without assets, particularly the “Ninjas” (No Income, No Job or Assets) have seen how their meager wealth, if you can call it that, has shrunk as the recession has caused massive loss of jobs, wages and purchasing power. Whenever public officials say that we are in the same boat, I think we are missing the point. Do they know that many Filipinos today do not have the luxury of having three meals a day? Or that many households have experienced disconnection of water and electricity supply? Non-economic capital
Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002) was a French sociologist, anthropologist and philosopher who was primarily concerned with the dynamics of power in society. He analyzed the diverse and subtle ways in which power is transferred and maintained across generations. Bourdieu emphasized how social classes, especially the ruling and intellectual classes, preserve their social privileges across generations, despite the myth that “contemporary post-industrial society boasts equality of opportunity and high social mobility, achieved through formal education.” In the 1970s, Bourdieu argued that “capital does not need to be viewed just through the lens of economics.” In his book, “Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste” (1979), he argued that “judgments of taste are related to social position, or more precisely, are themselves acts of social positioning.” Like it or not, capital helps acquire power, and power helps amass capital. They augment each other over time. During a crisis, the power of economic capital tends to immensely reward those with other types of capital as well. People with strong economic, cultural, or social capital are the most resilient in both the real and virtual worlds. Those who do not have these types of capital are worst hit and continue to struggle. Emotional capital is a form of cultural capital. It augurs well for people during crisis situations. According to the UK’s Mental Health Foundation (MHF), people with “pre-existing problems have fared dramatically worse” during the Covid-19 pandemic. The MHF reported that “We are all in the same storm, but we are not all in the same boat. [There is] a divergence in people’s experience depending on their social and/or economic context in society. Differences in mental health impact will persist and likely increase.” Disparities
Here’s the main point: Capital, in economic, emotional, social or cultural form, can provide the needed resilience during crisis situations. If you have capital, you’ll be better off than those who don’t. There will be tragic inequities. There’s no easy way to fix them. From the economic standpoint, increasing inequity will likely drag down productivity. From a political perspective, inequity can engender corrosive bitterness between the haves and have-nots. From a moral perspective, inequity in crisis is wrong and must be abated, if not totally eradicated. As the pandemic continues to disproportionately impact different social classes, governments must employ more innovative ways of collecting and analyzing data to better understand and address growing disparities. This could help reduce barriers and ensure a more efficient and equitable means of addressing problems caused by this pandemic, particularly with regards to testing, tracing, treatment, and vaccine administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or CDC has announced that one of its main thrusts is “equitable distribution of vaccines to all Americans, especially those who are marginalized because of race and ethnic origin and the associated poverty that goes with disparate distribution of wealth.” Civilized societies, like ours, are governed by laws. I think it was the late President Ramon Magsaysay who said these related but separate statements, “He who has less in life should have more in law. The little man is fundamentally entitled to a little bit more food in his stomach, a little more cloth on his back, and a little more roof over his head. … for the government exists for the welfare of the masses of the nation. A high and unwavering sense of morality should pervade all spheres of government activity.” When disease, hunger and despair reign, world governments should truly help the many who are poor. Or else, it might become more difficult to protect the few who are rich.

CERTIFIED A medical worker flashes her vaccination certificate after receiving her first dose of coronavirus vaccine at the Pasay City General Hospital. PHOTO BY J. GERARD SEGUIA Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. made the statement as he assured the public that more than 500,000 doses of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccines from the World Health Organization-led Covax facility would arrive this month. Some 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccines were supposed to arrive in the Philippines on Monday, March 1, but the delivery encountered delay due to “supply problems.” “Opo, iyong Covax facility ay inaasahan po natin na mayroon pa tayong 500,000 plus so sigurado po iyan darating ng Marso (Yes, we are expecting 500,000 plus from the COVAX facility and this will surely arrive this March),” Roque said in an interview over dzBB radio, when asked for the status of AstraZeneca vaccine delivery. “At kaya nga po kampante po ang gobyerno na tuluy-tuloy na po ito at sa lalong mabilis na panahon sana matapos po natin ang mga health workers, 3.4 million po iyan at pagkatapos po sana ay mayroon na tayong makuha para sa mga seniors dahil iyon na po ang ating susunod na target ng ating vaccination (That’s why the government is confident that the vaccination will be continuous and as soon as possible, we hope to finish vaccinating our 3.4 million health workers and after them, we hope to get more for the senior citizens because they are the next target of our vaccination),” he added. THE Philippines formally started its vaccination drive against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) on Monday, a day after the first 600,000 doses from Chinese firm Sinovac BioTech Ltd. arrived. Roque had hailed the first day of the government’s national Covid-19 vaccination program as “very successful.” He said frontline medical workers who received the vaccine now have “peace of mind” knowing that they have some sort of natural protection against the virus. “Maligaya po ang ating medical front-liners kasi nga po nagkaroon sila ng peace of mind na bagamat sila po’y exposed dito sa coronavirus, ay meron na silang proteksyon ngayon (Our medical front-liners are happy because they can have peace of mind even if they are exposed to Covid-19, they have protection now),” he said. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised against the use of the Sinovac  vaccine for healthcare workers attending to Covid-19 patients because it only has a 50.4 percent efficacy rate based on data from Brazil. However, the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group later recommended the use of CoronaVac even for health workers. Meanwhile, millions of doses are expected to arrive in the Philippines soon. Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., for one, said a million state-purchased Covid-19 doses are set to arrive this March. Galvez likewise said at least 5.2 million doses of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines from the  Covax facility are set to arrive in the second quarter. Initial procurements with Novavax and AstraZeneca from the private sector’s end are also expected to reach the country within the period. The government is targeting to inoculate at least 50 million individuals by the end of 2021. The Philippines has logged 580,442 infections as of Tuesday, after six straight days of more than 2,000 new cases."

The Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition unveiled an interactive map that shows 1,172 violent acts and attacks occurred against health workers or facilities last year, “a minimum estimate,” according to the NGO. More than a third (412) of the acts are directly related to Covid-19, it said, citing several examples including in Mexico, where a nurse was attacked and injured by a group accusing her of spreading the virus. In Dakar, three social workers had stones hurled at them by residents who refused to have a coronavirus victim buried near their homes. In Birmingham, England, a health worker was spat at and insulted by a neighbor. The vast majority, 80 percent, of the perpetrators of the violence were civilians, but threats also came from public authorities. In Egypt, health workers who criticized the regime’s handling of the pandemic were arrested by security forces and accused of spreading false information and of belonging to a terrorist group. Insecurity Insight, which developed the interactive map, also recorded 802 attacks in countries at war or on victims of civil conflicts, such as the bombing of hospitals in Yemen and the kidnapping of doctors in Nigeria. “The map shows that violence and intimidation against health care was a truly global crisis in 2020, affecting 79 countries,” said Insecurity Insight director Christina Wille in a statement. Leonard Rubenstein, the president and founder of the Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition and a professor at Johns Hopkins University, called on international governments to protect health workers, including by fighting disinformation."

31,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/03/02/news/deal-reached-to-get-california-children-back-in-classrooms/846702/,Associated Press,"March 2, 2021",Deal reached to get California children back in classrooms,"ELK GROVE, California: The majority of California’s 6.1 million public school students could be back in the classroom by April under new legislation announced Monday by Gov. Gavin Newsom and legislative leaders. Critics panned the plan as inadequate. Most students in the nation’s most populous state have been learning from home for the past year during the pandemic. But with new coronavirus cases falling rapidly throughout the state, Newsom and lawmakers have been under increasing pressure to come up with a statewide plan aimed at returning students to schools in-person. If approved by the Legislature, the plan announced Monday would not order districts to return students to the classroom and no parents would be compelled to send their kids back to school in-person. Instead, the state would set aside $2 billion to pay districts that get select groups of students into classrooms by the end of the month. Crucially, the legislation does not require districts to have an agreement with teachers’ unions on a plan for in-person instruction. That’s a barrier that many districts, including the nation’s second-largest district in Los Angeles, have not been able to overcome. It also does not require all teachers be vaccinated, as teacher unions had urged and that could take months given the nation’s limited supply of vaccine. The legislation would make it state law that 10 percent of the state’s vaccine supply be set aside specifically for teachers and school staff. “You can’t reopen your economy unless you get your schools reopened for in-person instruction,” said Newsom, who announced the deal with state Senate President Pro Tempore Toni Atkins and Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon at an elementary school in the Elk Grove Unified School District just south of Sacramento. The district, one of the first in the country to halt in-person learning last year because of the coronavirus, plans to return to in-person instruction later this month. The state’s two largest teachers unions mostly praised the agreement, with California Federation of Teachers President Jeff Freitas calling the prioritization of vaccines for teachers “a huge victory.” Kevin Gordon, a lobbyist representing many of the state’s school districts, called the plan “a grand slam home run,” saying it “dismantled every impediment to reopening that we’ve had so far.” The announcement comes at a critical time for Newsom, who could face a recall election later this year fueled by anger over his response to the pandemic. Kevin Faulconer, the former Republican mayor of San Diego who already has announced his candidacy, said the plan Newsom announced “isn’t even close to good enough for our kids and teachers.” In this Feb. 25, 2021 file photo, Assistant Principal Janette Van Gelderen (left) welcomes students at Newhall Elementary in Santa Clarita, California. AP PHOTO “For months, Newsom has ignored science and left public schools across our state shuttered while private schools are open,” Faulconer said. “For him to tout this as an accomplishment after months of inexcusable failures shows how out of touch he is, and why he should be recalled.” In addition to the $2 billion, the legislation would give all school districts access to $4.6 billion to help students who have struggled with learning from home. Districts could use this money to add another month to the school year or they could spend it on counseling and tutoring for students who need the most help. To get their slice of the $2 billion, districts in counties under the state’s most restrictive set of coronavirus rules — known as the purple tier — must offer in-person learning for transitional kindergarten through second grade, plus certain vulnerable students in all grades. This includes students who are disabled, homeless, in foster care, learning English, don’t have access to technology or are at risk of abuse and neglect. Counties in the next group, known as the red tier, must offer in-person instruction for all elementary school grades, plus at least one grade each in middle and high schools. With new coronavirus cases falling, Newsom said he expects most counties to be in the red tier by the end of the month. Districts that meet the March 31 deadline get full compensation based on a complicated formula, while those that meet the standards after April 1 get less money. Districts that fail to have children back in classrooms before May 15 won’t get any money. The bill does not say how long students must be in the classroom each week. That concerns Jonathan Zachreson, founder of the parent group Reopen California Schools, who says districts could offer classroom instruction for a few hours one day per week and still get the money. He predicted many parents will get excited reading headlines from Monday’s announcement, only to end up frustrated. “It does not compel any school district to open other than just bribing them with extra money,” he said. “We need to have higher standards for what in-person learning means.” Newsom dismissed those concerns, saying he is “confident people won’t be gaming the system that way.” Cecily Myart-Cruz, head of United Teachers Los Angeles, said she worries the state plan would benefit schools in wealthier neighborhoods where the coronavirus is less prevalent. “This would send extra dollars to affluent areas that are able to reopen because of low infection rates, leaving students from low-income communities of color behind,” she said. Megan Bacigalupi, a parent advocate with Open Schools California, said she worried there was no urgency to get middle and high school students back to classrooms, noting the agreement does not require all of those students to return for in-person learning. “Framing this as a reopening deal is blind to the fact that there will be kids that will not be back in school this year,” she said. California Teachers Association President E. Toby Boyd praised the legislation for recognizing the union’s safety concerns, which were broadcast to state residents in television ads that started running last month. But he criticized the plan for only requiring coronavirus testing in schools located in counties where the coronavirus is the most widespread."

The new cases were part of the eighth batch of 350 samples sequenced by the Philippine Genome Center in the past week.

Even with the mass inoculation for the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) finally underway, the government still has not fully convinced majority of the people to get their shots. Standing in the way are prevailing perceptions about the risks of getting vaccinated and the efficacy of some vaccines. NO FAN OF NEEDLES A personnel at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium in Caloocan City braces for the prick of the needle during the initial inoculation of health workers on March 1, 2021. PHOTO BY RENE H. DILAN But a member of the Department of Science and Technology’s Vaccine Expert Panel warned in an online interview with The Manila Times that this was not the time to be choosy when it came to a Covid-19 vaccine because the virus had already mutated. Dr. Nina Gloriani, a microbiologist, believes that any of the three vaccines approved for use in the country is capable of providing protection against infection. Given the green light for emergency use in the Philippines are Pfizer and BioNTech tozinameran’s Cominarty, AstraZeneca’s AZD1222, and Sinovac Biotech’s CoronaVac.
CoronaVac has the lowest efficacy rate at 61 percent, while Cominarty has the highest at 95 percent. For Gloriani, the detection of Covid-19 variants and mutations in parts of the country means that the government must waste no time in immunizing as many people as it can. The Department of Health plans to vaccinate at least 70 million people before the end of this year to achieve herd immunity, the percentage of the population that has to be vaccinated to reach an acceptable threshold of protection against the virus. “Para sa akin, kung ano ang mauna d’yan, kung high-risk ka for exposure to Covid, you take the vaccine, a 50-percent efficacy is better than zero. Hindi tayo pwedeng mag-wait nang matagal, dahil ang variants nandito na (For me, whatever vaccine is the first to be rolled out and if you have a high-risk exposure to Covid, you have to take it, as a 50-percent efficacy is better than zero; and we cannot wait for too long since the variants are already here),” Gloriani said. The emergence of variants will affect the efficacy of the vaccines, although manufacturers were modifying their vaccine formulations to create booster shots against the mutations, she said. To prevent mutations from affecting vaccine efficacy, the public must continue to practice health precautions such as wearing face masks and face shields, physical distancing and continued hygiene. “Kung ang tao, nag-iingat mabuti, wala nang pupuntahan ang virus kasi ang virus, habang may malilipatan na buhay na cells, dadami s’ya at dadami; at habang siya ay nagre-replicate, mataas ang mutation nya kaya dapat mapigil ang transmission (If people are really being careful, the virus will not be able to transfer itself. So long as it moves to a living cell, it will multiply until it replicates and create a mutation. So, it is imperative that we prevent transmission),” Gloriani said. She added that relying solely on a vaccine’s efficacy rate could be misleading, since the rate could differ widely during clinical trials for a specific sector such as health care workers, adults aged 18 to 59 years old, or senior citizens. “If you test the vaccine in a general population where the exposure to Covid is lower, tataas ang efficacy mo, maiiba iyun,” she explained. Such was the case for the CoronaVac, which posted a 50.4-percent efficacy among health care workers in a clinical trial in Brazil. “At the time of the clinical trial, ang taas ng kaso ng Covid cases sa Brazil…if you are talking about 10,000 na binigyan ng bakuna — kalahati placebo — puro health care workers ‘yun and in a situation na mataas ang cases, mataas din ang possibility or probability na magkaka-Covid sila so mataas ‘yung gan’ung scenario (the Covid cases in Brazil were already high…so if you are talking about the 10,000 people who were given shots — half of which were placebo — all of them were health care workers who were in situations where there prevalent cases, they had a high probability of being infected with Covid, that scenario is hugely [expected]),” Gloriani said. The 50-percent efficacy threshold for Covid vaccines set by the World Health Organization was based on the different attack rates of the virus across the globe. In the end, what counts most is the protection the vaccine provides against the most severe infection. “With a pandemic vaccine, hindi natin expect na mapo-protektahan ang lahat, pati mild, moderate, severe, but what we are after, na ma-protektahan against the severe form of the disease, kasi ayaw natin may mamatay, may ma-critically ill kasi ‘yung health care system, papanik din ang ating resources doon (we still cannot expect to protect everyone, including those with mild, moderate and severe cases, but what we are after is to protect them against the severe form of the disease because we do not want health workers to die or be critically ill and to experience a strain in our health care resources),” Gloriani said."

Every day there is the chance of getting the disease.” FOR SAFEKEEPING A pharmacist stores vials of anti-Covid vaccine at a cold storage machine at the Sta. Ana Hospital inManila on March 1, 2021. Doses of vaccines will be distributed to more hospitals this week. PHOTO BY MIKE ALQUINTO She added that she did not want to wait any longer and wanted to get vaccinated with the first available vaccine that would arrive in the country. “Ayoko nang maghintay (I don’t want to wait); there is always a threat of getting Covid. There is also the threat of dying from Covid, with so many vaccines available. There are many efficacies available, but for preventing them, they are all the same,” she told The Manila Times minutes before she was inoculated. Twenty other medical professionals at the Lung Center received their jabs. Aniceto, who was vaccinated by Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd, joked that being inoculated by the Health chief made her feel like a guinea pig. Aniceto said she listened to infectious disease experts such as Dr. Edsel Maurice Salvana and Dr. Rontgene Solante before deciding to be vaccinated. “They studied all the scientific data and I will trust their judgment is enough to put my faith on. And I am hoping that by being the first one in Lung Center, I hope to give that message to everyone also,” she added. Nursing aide Jove Erdadan, meanwhile, said he wanted to be protected against Covid-19 and that he trusted the vaccine. Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the Lung Center of the Philippines Employees Association,
refused to take any vaccine made in China. He said he would wait for a vaccine made either in Russia or the United States. The police and the military had their own vaccination rollouts, with two persons who received their first doses exhibiting “very mild” reactions. In the military, the first to get the vaccine was Col. Fatima Claire Navarro, commanding officer of the V. Luna Medical Center. Her first dose of CoronaVac was also administered by Duque. Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles and Quezon City Mayor Josefina Belmonte witnessed the rollout at the V. Luna Medical Center. Navarro said she did not feel any adverse effects afterwards and the injection itself did not cause any pain. “I didn’t feel anything different after the vaccination. No feeling of heaviness, nothing painful and even the injection, there was nothing unusual,” she told reporters. She noted that they had studied all vaccines and their possible reactions and found all of them offered “appropriate” protection from the virus. “Now, what’s important is the timeliness,” Navarro said. “It’s important that we will save our fellow countrymen’s lives, our lives and our family’s lives against Covid-19.” Vaccination for military personnel is mandatory. Those who refuse face sanctions under the Articles of War 105. In Camp Crame, BGen. Luisito Magnaye, head of the Philippine National Police’s Health Services Command, was the first to receive the vaccine. He said he did not feel anything unusual, but pointed out that 24 hours were needed to monitor possible effects. At the Veterans Memorial Medical Center, two hospital personnel were taken to the
emergency room after experiencing “very mild” effects. The two unidentified workers developed rashes, but hospital Director Dominador Chiong said they recovered after receiving medication. Other ranking government officials and health experts who attended the vaccination rollout at PGH also received their shots. Among them was the Department of Health’s Technical Advisory Group member and infectious disease expert Edsel Salvana. “I’m alive! Arm hurts but that’s just my immune cells getting ready to churn out anti-Covid antibodies. [Number] 2 to get vaccinated in the Philippines!” Salvana said on Facebook. Food and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo was also vaccinated. He said because the syringe was small and the nurses at PGH were experts at inoculation, he hardly felt the shot. Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chief Benhur Abalos was also vaccinated. He said the death of his mother from the virus inspired him to have the inoculation. Corazon Abalos, the wife of former Commission on Elections chairman Benjamin Abalos Sr., died in January. The MMDA chief had also tested positive for the virus, contracting it from his mother. “Don’t let yourself remain unvaccinated. The more individuals who will be inoculated, the earlier our fight against this disease will end,” he said. Manila Mayor Francisco Do-magoso attended the event but did not get a shot, saying health care workers should be prioritized."

Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. TMT file photo Speaking in Filipino during an interview with state-run PTV 4 on Saturday, Roque said the “change in protocol” also meant that the health workers could wait for their preferred brand. Roque gave the assurance as 600,000 doses of CoronaVac, the first batch that the Philippines will be receiving from its manufacturer Sinovac Biotech Ltd., and 525,600 doses from British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca through the Covax Facility will be arriving on Sunday and Monday, respectively. It also came a day after health personnel from the Philippine General Hospital protested against the government plan to inoculate them with the Chinese-made vaccine and demanded that they be given “the safest dose” with the “highest efficacy rate” although they did not name a specific brand. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) had approved the recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and the Department of Health’s Technical Advisory Group to allow the administration of Sinovac vaccines to frontline medical workers. The IATF-EID’s approval comes despite results of clinical trials showing that the Sinovac vaccine only has a 50.4-percent efficacy rate among health care workers exposed to Covid-19. The Palace official clarified that the new rule would only apply to health care workers because of the condition stipulated in the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued to Sinovac. “Pang-health care workers lang po iyan. Sa lahat po, kinakailangan po talaga kung ano ang naririyan ay tatanggapin natin (That’s just for health care workers. So, the rest must accept whatever vaccine is available),” Roque said. Nonetheless, Roque said no one would be forced to take CoronaVac. The FDA had allowed the emergency use of CoronaVac on healthy individuals aged 18 to 59 not including health care workers. On Wednesday, Roque said the government decided to administer the Sinovac vaccine to “economic frontliners” from 18 to 59 years old. He said Cabinet officials and even Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo might also be among the first in line to receive the vaccines from Sinovac. Roque said the government was “excited” over the delivery of the vaccines with President Rodrigo Duterte himself personally attending the ceremony prepared at the Villamor Airbase in Pasay City on Sunday afternoon. AstraZeneca, too A day after the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines, the first round of the allocated doses from AstraZeneca from the Covax Facility will be arriving at noontime on Monday, Roque announced late Saturday in a statement. “This forms part of the 44 million doses of Covax to inoculate 20 percent of our population,” he said. Roque thanked the co-leaders of the Covax Facility — World Health Organization, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund — toward this end. The Philippines stands to get 9.4 million doses from AstraZeneca and US drugmaker Pfizer-BioNTech through the Covax Facility, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had said. The FDA has previously granted EUAs to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. MMDA ready In anticipation of the arrival of the Sinovac vaccines, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) announced on Saturday that it was ready to deliver the first batch of vaccines to their destinations. MMDA Chairman Benjamin Abalos Jr. said the vaccines would initially be stored at the Health department’s cold storage warehouse in Marikina City. Abalos said during the Laging Handa public briefing on PTV-4 that the MMDA’s Bus Carousel along EDSA or its adjoining lane would be used to hasten the delivery of the vaccines to at least 30 hospitals. Abalos said based on their simulations, they might be able to make the deliveries from the warehouse to the different hospitals in Metro Manila where the vaccines would be administered earlier than expected and advised motorists passing through the same route to give way to the six 40-foot container vans."
39,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/28/opinion/editorial/confident-of-rebound-despite-challenges/846098/,The Manila Times,"February 28, 2021",Confident of rebound despite challenges," Economic managers, along with others monitoring the country’s pulse, remain confident of a healthy rebound this year. This is welcome news, given that gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 9 percent in 2020, mainly because of the response against the coronavirus pandemic that has killed some 2.5 million people worldwide. FIRST FOR THE YEAR (Clockwise from top left) Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Gov. Benjamin Diokno, BDO Capital & Investment Corporation President Eduardo Francisco, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd and former finance secretary and Asia Pacific Credit Suisse Managing Director Jose Isidro Camacho speak during The Manila Times’ economic forum, Rising from the ashes: From Pan-Asian to pan-global, on Feb. 26, 2021. SCREENGRABBED FROM THE EVENT At The Manila Times economic forum on Friday, Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd sees a GDP growth of between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent this year, the same forecast that was announced earlier. Central bank Governor Benjamin Diokno said inflation would be “benign” despite moves to ramp up consumer spending and the cost-push price increases seen recently. Former Finance secretary Jose Isidro Camacho, now the Credit Suisse Asia-Pacific managing director and vice president in Singapore, pointed out that the Philippines stood to benefit from its inclusion in Asean or Association of Southeast Asian Nations. That regional bloc, he added, was expected to grow 6 percent this year. And finally, Eduardo Francisco, BDO Capital and Investment Corp. president, said Philippine firms were generally healthy enough to weather the pandemic’s effects. Assumptions and caveats For the most part, we agree with the rosy outlook. But as in any forecast, certain assumptions were made. There were also a few caveats mentioned by the forum’s speakers, particularly related to the Covid-19 vaccines and the quality of recovery expected, that policymakers and other national leaders should not ignore. First, Secretary Dominguez mentioned that Congress needed to pass as many as 14 pieces of legislation certified as “priority” because of their role in economic recovery. Among the priority bills is Guide — Government Financial Institutions Unified Initiatives to Distressed Enterprises for Economic Recovery. Urgent amendments were also needed in the Foreign Investment Act, Public Service Act and Retail Trade Liberalization Act. These, the secretary added, would complement the country’s participation in the RCEP, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the largest multilateral trade agreement in the world. Whether Congress will buckle down to work on these proposals amid the distractions from the upcoming elections is yet to be seen. We should be vigilant against and intolerant of delays. Speaking of RCEP, Mr. Camacho was bullish about that multilateral agreement but explained that the dividends from it would not be seen soon. Meanwhile, the government has to do better in acquiring Covid-19 vaccines. We agree. As we pointed out many times in this space, the Philippine economy is consumption-led. Personal spending accounts for about 70 percent of GDP. And so, an economic recovery effort has to be anchored on easing the quarantine measures and bolstering consumer confidence by ensuring public health safety. The way to do that is to inoculate enough Filipinos to establish herd immunity. Regrettably, vaccines are proving to be difficult to acquire, a situation resulting from the perilous combination of global supply issues and poor administration of this health crisis. Worse, the slow vaccine rollout, which hopefully starts today, exacerbated the wealth gap, as well as the divide between the politically connected and others without similar connections. That matters and not only because viruses do not discriminate according to income brackets and political camps. Of course, there is labor. Most workers will not qualify to be among those on the priority list of people to be inoculated. If workers remain unprotected from the virus, restarting industries will be a struggle. There are also small enterprises, which are more vulnerable to the economic fallout. Micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) account for more than 96 percent of all registered firms in the country. MSMEs also employ 62.4 percent of the labor force, and they contribute 35.7 percent of the value added and 25 percent of export revenues.
To be fair, the Duterte government’s mantra is to “heal as one.” That sounds reassuring, but not everyone appears to be on the same page, so to speak. Instead, many seem more Darwinian — that is, survival of the fittest in terms of wealth and privilege. National leaders need to address these inequities, if the rosy economic forecasts mentioned earlier are to be realized."

Roque said the initial delivery forms “part of the 44 million doses of Covax to inoculate 20 percent” of the population. Roque thanked the World Health Organization, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund toward this end. “We are grateful to everyone — from our medical frontliners to our fellow Filipinos and foreign partners — who stand by us in this challenging time,” he said. “Together, we will heal and recover as one nation and one people,” the Palace official added. The Philippines stands to get 9.4 million doses from AstraZeneca and US drugmaker Pfizer-BioNTech through Covax facility, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. had said. About 5.5 million of the 9.2 million doses are expected from AstraZeneca, whose initial delivery was scheduled mid to late February. On the other hand, 117,000 doses will come from Pfizer-BioNTech. The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has previously granted emergency use authorizations (EUAs)to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Philippine government is also set to receive the first batch of the Sinovac vaccines from China at 5 p.m. at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City today, February 28.

Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said Duterte on Friday retained the GCQ classification of the National Capital Region, Baguio City and Davao City until March 31. Also under GCQ are, for Luzon, Batangas and some areas in the Cordillera Administrative Region which include Apayao, Kalinga and Mountain Province; Tacloban City for the Visayas; Iligan City and Lanao del Sur for Mindanao, he said. The rest of the country, meanwhile, will be under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). “The above mentioned risk-level classifications will take effect starting Monday, March 1 until March 31, 2021,” Roque added. The new community quarantine classifications came days after Duterte rejected the proposal to place the country under MGCQ until the country’s Covid-19 vaccination program has started. Nine of 17 mayors in the capital region had backed a shift to MGCQ by March, which marks a year since the country was first placed under quarantine. Metro Manila, which accounts for about a third of the country’s gross domestic product, has been under GCQ since August 2020, with stricter lockdowns enforced in the earlier months as Covid-19 infections rose. To date, the country recorded 568,680 Covid-19 cases, with 524,042 recoveries and 12,201 deaths. The country has yet to receive any Covid-19 shot, with which it hoped to launch its vaccination drive this month, and cover up to 70 million people or two-thirds of the population through the year. The Palace has announced that the first batch of China’s Sinovac Biotech vaccines would arrive in the Philippines on Sunday. The President will personally witness the arrival of the vaccines. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently cleared the Sinovac vaccine for emergency use. However, Sinovac is not recommended for healthcare workers and senior citizens due to its 50 percent efficacy rate. Sinovac is the third vaccine brand to receive emergency use authorization after Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines."

OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT PHOTO JUST like other governments in the world grappling with the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, the Duterte administration’s fight against the deadly virus got off to a rough start but started showing improvements after recalibrating its strategy by balancing the effective control of the disease, as well as the socioeconomic costs. Malacañang has released at least 33 coronavirus-related issuances, including Proclamation 922, which President Rodrigo Duterte signed on March 8 to declare a State of Public Health Emergency to mobilize government and non-government agencies to respond to the impending health crisis. “The declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency would capacitate government agencies and (local government units) to immediately act to prevent loss of life, utilize appropriate resources to implement urgent and critical measures to contain or prevent the spread of Covid-19, mitigate its effects and impact to the community, and prevent serious disruption of the functioning of the government and the community,” the proclamation read. On Mar. 16, Duterte placed the entire Luzon under enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) until Apr. 12. On the same day, he signed Proclamation 929 declaring a state of calamity throughout the country after health authorities confirmed that community-based transmission of Covid-19 has already occurred. “Such declaration will, among others, afford the national government, as well as LGUs ample latitude to utilize appropriate funds, including the Quick Response Fund, in their disaster preparedness and response efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 and to continue to provide basic services to the affected population,” it read. Bayanihan laws
To mitigate the impact of the pandemic, Duterte signed Republic Act (RA) 11469, also known as the Bayanihan to Heal As One Act of 2020 (Bayanihan 1), a day after Congress passed the bill on Mar. 24. Under the law, Duterte, for a limited time, was given special powers, including reallocation of government funds to address the prevailing health crisis. With the law in effect, the government was given the authority to expedite and streamline the accreditation of testing kits to facilitate prompt testing and immediate isolation and treatment of patients. Health care workers, considered as among the frontliners in the fight against Covid-19, had to be provided with Covid-19 special risk allowances in addition to their hazard pay. Their Covid-19-related medical expenses were also shouldered by the government. The government was also given the authority to provide compensation of P100,000 to health care workers who contracted severe Covid-19 infection while in the line of duty while P1 million may be provided to health care workers who die while fighting the pandemic. Banks and other financial institutions were ordered to implement grace periods for the payment of loans without incurring interests, penalties, fees, or other charges. In September, he signed RA 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2), which extended Duterte’s special powers for handling the pandemic and provide a P165.5-billion fund to address the health crisis. The largest chunk of the budget was allotted to loans for sectors hit by the pandemic, such as micro, small, and medium-scale enterprises, transport, tourism, and agriculture. It also provided for the government’s Covid-19 health-related response. Cash aid
Among the most salient features of the Bayanihan 1 law was the allocation of P200 billion worth of emergency subsidies to fund the government’s Social Amelioration Program (SAP), which granted a P5,000 to P8,000 monthly cash aid to about 18 million low-income Filipino families affected by the pandemic. The cash aid program was said to be the “largest financial aid package ever granted to Filipino households.” However, the SAP encountered delays in the release and distribution of funds. Despite hiccups, 71 percent of Filipino families said they received cash aid from the government since the start of the pandemic, according to SWS survey conducted from Sep. 17 to 20. Besides the SAP, the government also had other cash aid programs for the most vulnerable sectors affected by the lockdown, such as the Abot Kamay ang Pagtulong (AKAP), Tulong Panghanap-buhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD), and the Covid-19 Adjustment Measures Program (CAMP). Duterte threatened to detain politicians who would engage in corruption amid the prevailing health crisis, saying that the public should never be deceived, especially in these trying times. On Nov. 10, he offered a cash prize worth P50,000 to P100,000 to anyone who could report dishonest government officials and their corruption activities. Test, Trace, Treat
In April, the government started its mass testing initiatives following the accreditation of several hospitals for Covid-19 testing. The government had also started purchasing more rapid antibody test kits, aiming to test 1.5 percent to 2 percent of the country’s 110 million population to get a clear picture of Covid-19 infections in the Philippines. On May 6, Duterte inked Executive Order (EO) 114 institutionalizing the “Balik Probinsya, Bagong Pag-Asa” program designed to help low-income families in Metro Manila resettle in their home provinces by assisting their transition with support and incentives on transportation, subsistence, and education, among others. “Balik Probinsya” was temporarily suspended to prioritize the short-term “Hatid Probinsya” or the provision of transportation assistance to locally stranded individuals and overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) stranded in Manila due to travel restrictions imposed under community quarantine. To ensure the health and safety of students, the President on July 17 signed RA 11480, which reschedules the start of the school year in case of a state of emergency or state of calamity. The opening of classes for School Year 2020-2021 kicked off on Oct. 5. He also stood by his decision not to allow face-to-face (F2F) classes until a vaccine for Covid-19 is available in the country. Although he initially approved pilot F2F classes in areas with low risk of Covid-19 on Dec. 14, he withdrew this plan a week after a new strain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARS-COV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, emerged in the UK. In his fifth and penultimate State of the Nation Address on July 27, Duterte admitted that there were “lessons to be learned” from the Covid-19 pandemic. “The gains we achieved in the first three-and-a-half years were put to a test when the pandemic suddenly struck the global community. While I am aware that the road toward a comfortable life for all would be far easy if pandemic had not occurred and along the rest of the world we suffered,” he said. However, Duterte said the country was able to withstand the challenges brought about by the health crisis. He also vowed to facilitate the country’s economic recovery. “The global scale and socio-economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has been unprecedented. Yet in the throes of this global health emergency, we have been able to withstand the headwinds generated by this coronavirus,” Duterte added. In August, the One Hospital Command system was launched to improve the referral system and interoperability of public and private health care facilities treating patients with Covid-19. In the same month, Duterte said he would volunteer to be among the first to be inoculated with the Covid-19 vaccine being developed by Russia, Sputnik V, to show “great trust.” Malacañang, however, said the President would first have to receive approval from the Presidential Security Group (PSG) before he is permitted to push through. Also in August, he formed a task force headed by the Department of Justice to investigate alleged corruption in the state-run Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) amid the pandemic. He also ordered the implementation of a reshuffle within the state insurance firm following the appointment of new PhilHealth chief Dante Gierran. Equal access to vaccines
On Sep. 23, Duterte, for the first time, participated in the United Nations (UN) General Assembly, where he stressed the importance of ensuring universal access to anti-Covid-19 technologies and products, including a safe and effective vaccine. “When the world finds that vaccine, access to it must not be denied nor withheld. It should be made available to all, rich and poor nations alike, as a matter of policy. The Philippines joins our partners in the Asean and the Non-Aligned Movement in raising our collective voice: the Covid-19 vaccine must be considered a global public good. Let us be clear on this,” he said. Duterte reiterated his call for equal access to vaccines in his speech during the 37th Asean Summit on Nov. 12, adding that the immediate priority right now should be “health security.” “We must work together to ensure that all nations – rich or poor – will have access to safe vaccines. No one is safe until all of us are safe,” he said. On Oct. 27, Duterte said he favored a government-to-government transaction in the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines, saying it would prevent the risk of corruption. In November, Duterte signed EO 118 placing a price cap on reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing and test kits for Covid-19. In signing the EO, the President recognized the priority of the state to ensure that the general public, especially those from low- and middle-income households, have “equitable access” to quality and affordable health care services, such as Covid-19 tests. Although initially against the payment of reservation fees, Duterte on Nov. 19 approved the recommendation to make advance payments to suppliers of potential Covid-19 vaccines. He agreed to enter into advance market commitments (AMCs) to avoid being among the last countries to acquire a vaccine. He approved the recommendation a day after he noted that the government must get the “best bargain” for the country’s supply of Covid-19 vaccines once available. On Dec. 1, Duterte, through EO 121, granted authority to the Food and Drug Administration to issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for Covid-19 drugs and vaccines subject to several conditions. The EUA is expected to speed up the processing time for approval of potential vaccines from six months to 21 to 28 days. Every Monday night, Duterte presides over a meeting with the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF-EID) core members before his talk to the people to give the public updates on the government’s fight against the pandemic. In several speeches, he assured the public that the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines for Filipinos would be free from corruption. The poorest of the poor, the elderly, uniformed personnel, health care workers, and those with comorbidities will be prioritized in the government’s immunization drive. As Covid-19 vaccines remain unavailable, Duterte has repeatedly reminded the public to strictly observe health and safety protocols, particularly the wearing of face masks and face shields, washing of hands, and physical distancing. He cut short his Christmas vacation to meet with government officials on the new strain of SARS-COV-2 found in the UK on Dec. 26. During the meeting, he suggested the creation of a new task force that would focus on the new strain. Duterte later approved a recommendation to temporarily ban “all foreign travelers” from the UK and 19 other countries from entering the Philippines until Jan. 15, 2021. On Dec. 28, he signed the P4.5 trillion national budget for 2021 that includes funds allotted to boost government efforts to respond to the pandemic and provide critical measures to aid the economic and social sectors."

The long-anticipated shot could offer the nation a third vaccine option and help speed vaccinations by requiring just one dose instead of two. Food and Drug Administration scientists confirmed that overall the vaccine is about 66 percent effective at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19, and about 85 percent effective against the most serious illness. The agency also said J&J’s shot is safe. The analysis is just one step in the FDA’s evaluation. On Friday, the agency’s independent advisers will debate if the evidence is strong enough to recommend the shot. With that advice, the FDA is expected to make a final decision within days. The Covid-19 death toll in the US topped 500,000 this week, and the vaccination drive has been slower than hoped, hampered by logistical and weather delays. So far, about 44.5 million Americans have received at least one dose of vaccine made by Pfizer or Moderna, and nearly 20 million of them have received the second dose required for full protection. Tests showed the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were 95 percent effective at protection against symptomatic Covid-19. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, is part of the FDA advisory panel that will scrutinize the J&J data on Friday and cautions that none of the vaccines have been directly compared. Still, he was encouraged that one dose of the J&J vaccine appears as good at preventing serious illness as its two-dose competitors. “This is a vaccine to prevent you from going to the hospital and dying at a level that’s certainly comparable” to the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, he said. J&J tested its single-dose option in 44,000 adults in the US, Latin America and South Africa. Different mutated versions of the virus are circulating in different countries, and the FDA analysis cautioned that it’s not clear how well the vaccine works against each variant. But J&J previously announced that the vaccine worked better in the US — 72 percent effective against moderate to severe Covid-19, compared with 66 percent in Latin America and 57 percent in South Africa. South Africa recently began giving the J&J vaccine to front-line health workers on a test basis after deciding that a vaccine from rival AstraZeneca had not shown strong enough study results against the particularly concerning variant spreading there. “I was reassured” that despite different variants, the J&J shot still protected against serious illness, said Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University, a former FDA vaccine chief. “That’s pretty robust data.” In case the vaccines eventually need to be updated, manufacturers are working on adjustments to their recipes. Moderna announced Wednesday that it is ready to begin testing experimental doses that better match the South African version of the virus. Across all countries, the analysis of the J&J vaccine showed protection began to emerge about 14 days after vaccination. But by 28 days after vaccination, there were no hospitalizations or deaths in the vaccinated group compared with 16 hospitalizations and seven deaths in study recipients who received a dummy shot. This Dec. 2, 2020 photo provided by Johnson & Johnson shows vials of the Janssen Covid19 vaccine in the United States. Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose vaccine protects against COVID-19, according to an analysis by US regulators Wednesday, Feb. 24, 2021, that sets the stage for a final decision on a new and easier-to-use shot to help tame the pandemic. PHOTO BY JOHNSON & JOHNSON VIA AP The FDA said effectiveness and safety were consistent across racial groups, including Black and Latino participants. All of the world’s Covid-19 vaccines have been tested differently, making comparisons nearly impossible. It would not be surprising if one dose turned out to be a little weaker than two doses, and policymakers will decide if that’s an acceptable trade-off to get more people vaccinated faster. J&J has another large study underway to see if a second dose of its vaccine works better, raising the prospect that countries could eventually add a booster if one turned out to be warranted. Like other Covid-19 vaccines, the main side effects of the J&J shot are pain at the injection site and flu-like fever, fatigue and headache. No study participant experienced the severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis, that is a rare risk of some other Covid-19 shots, although one experienced a less serious reaction. The FDA said there were no serious side effects linked to the vaccine so far, although it recommended further monitoring for blood clots. In the study, those were reported in about 15 vaccine recipients and 10 placebo recipients, not enough of a difference to tell if the vaccine played any role. J&J was on track to become the world’s first one-dose option until earlier this month. Mexico announced it would use a one-dose version from China’s CanSino, which is made with similar technology as J&J’s shot but initially was developed as a two-dose option until beginning a one-dose test in the fall. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines now being used in the US and numerous other countries must be kept frozen, while the J&J shot can last three months in a refrigerator, making it easier to handle. AstraZeneca’s vaccine — widely used in Europe and Britain — is made similarly and also requires refrigeration but takes two doses. If the FDA clears the J&J shot for US use, it will not boost vaccine supplies significantly right away. Only a few million doses are expected to be ready for shipping in the first week. But J&J told Congress this week that it expected to provide 20 million doses by the end of March and 100 million by summer. European regulators and the World Health Organization also are considering J&J’s vaccine. Worldwide, the company aims to produce around a billion doses by the end of the year. "

Humankind has been the subject of much research. Studies on human dynamics have caused many hours of thoughtful observations and reflections to draw out what these differences are among us humans. These differences underpin our manner of thinking, feeling and acting. These differences, salient and latent, lie beneath, much like what is below an iceberg, Understanding human dynamics. Our understanding of life, our dealing with relationships, how we perform our responsibilities, face problems, make decisions and choose and implement solutions — all these are influenced by an innate system in each of us. This system impacts on how we think, feel and act. Thus, there are these differences among identical twins, family members, teachers, students and among people within our respective organizations or communities with whom we work. Unless we are aware of our respective differences, we cannot avoid misunderstandings and thus fail in our relationships. For us teachers, we would likely have some unproductive teaching due to our approaches not matching our students’ learning processes. This situation results in minimized learning of our students or worse, in their dropping out from our classes or from the school. The same is true to child rearing or parenting. This explains why children at times become rebellious or would feel unloved, harboring ill feelings up to adult age because we parents fail to understand what anchors their manner of thinking, feeling and acting. Leaders who know the mental framework of their constituents, would be able “to utilize their own and that of their constituents’ distinctive processes and capacities to achieve optimal individual and group performance.” Otherwise, employees become unproductive. Employees would execute work haphazardly because of their leader whose manner of speech and action leaves much to strain relationships. What is human dynamics? Human dynamics is a doctoral subject for students with a major in human resource management or in leadership and organization. Human Dynamics is apt and necessary, especially for leaders and office heads, to understand the human systems that constitute their respective organizations. Understanding human dynamics would have leaders know what continuing professional development is appropriate for employees to recognize, appreciate, and optimally utilize their diverse capacities, and work together harmoniously and productively. Human dynamics would enlighten students by what scholars have drawn from their studies — the inner differences that influence how “people think, plan and learn; experience emotions; communicate and relate with others; and go about engaging in activities and projects.” (www.humandynamics.com › who-we-are) These latent differences are true to “everyone, regardless of age, gender, culture, country or race.” Human dynamics research. Studies refer to three human system principles: the mental, emotional and physical principles. These principles work in tandem as people relate to one another. These are distinctive pathways to living our lives which flourish and contribute best under certain conditions and which could be developed, given we are aware of them. “The mental principle…is related to the mind — to thinking, values, structure, focus, objectivity, and perspective. The more subjective emotional principle concerns relationships — such as communication, connection, organization, empathy, harmony and “putting things together in new ways (creativity).” (https://thesystems.com/human-dynamics-for-the-21st-century/) A person with a well-developed emotional principle “is aware of his or her own feelings without being dominated by them and expresses those feelings appropriately.” The creative imagination, which accesses the inner life and makes connections in new ways, is also an expression of the emotional principle, which results in creativity. The “physical principle covers the process of “doing, making, producing, concretizing, detailing, making operational, utilizing, ensuring practicality, cooperating, synthesizing and systematizing,” operations. (https://dritter55.wordpress.com/2008/0709/a-brief-review-of-human-dynamics/) Human dynamics and new normal issues. Studies show that individuals function well when mental, emotional and physical principles are “developed and integrated.” But “when one or more principles are underdeveloped, a lack of wholeness and relative ineffectiveness exists in certain areas of a person’s life.” (https://dritter55.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/a-brief-review-of-human-dynamics/) “Whereas the mental principle is associated with the mind and thinking, and the emotional principle, with feelings and relating, the physical principle is aligned with the body and the translation into action of what is thought and felt.” (https://dritter55.wordpress.com/2008/07/09/a-brief-review-of-human-dynamics/) Drawing from these principles, how do they impact on the adaptiveness and preparedness of societies to the hazards of the pandemic? “The understanding of the dynamics which unfold during and in the direct aftermath of a pandemic are key to effective and efficient management decisions.” (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11299-020-00256-y) Human dynamics: impact on Covid-19 interventions. An analysis how the interventions adopted by different countries were influenced by the human dynamics of their respective governments — the people involved in coming out with these choices — would render us lessons. As Simon, et al. (1990; Gaissmaier & Gigerenzer, 2012) wrote, human dynamics that anchored their long term perspectives are likely to be shaped by two factors — the individual mind and the structure of the environment. “The former is affected by the perception of the Covid-19 pandemic as a dread risk with changes in behavioral patterns lurking” (Gigerenzer, 2004).“The latter also affects individual behavior as it determines the boundaries for adaptivity.” (Simon, 1990). “The structure of the environment is, amongst others, shaped by policy decisions.” Given the environment and the mindsets of our decision makers, we hope interventions adopted to ease our lives in this pandemic could have “a long-term perspective.” This “might help minimize unwanted (and often delayed) effects.” Error!

47,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/25/campus-press/under-new-management/844967/,"Ernie Cecilia, DPM","February 25, 2021",‘Under new management’,"When I was young and silly, I walked the streets in Manila on hot summer days to hunt for a full-time job. After graduating from a university high school in the country’s typhoon belt, I wanted to pursue college education in the university belt in Manila. But I first needed a job to finance my college education. Before I enrolled in college, I literally walked along Taft, Escolta, Dasmariñas, Tetuan, Avenida Rizal and Azcarraga to find a decent albeit menial job. There was no internet, Google or company websites then to make job hunting easy. Every day, I would meet ever changing faces coming my way, as I looked at street signs to my right and left. I would read familiar messages — NO Vacancy, Mail, Wanted Houseboy: Apply Inside, Beware of Dog (or its variation which warns “Forget the Dog, Beware the Owner”), Post No Bill, Do Not Enter, Under Renovation, or Under New Management. I knew what the other signs meant, but I was curious what “new management” would look like. I would often wonder, “Is the new management grumpier and greedier or kinder and more generous than the old one?” Game changer
My first encounter with a Manager reminded me how small I was in the overall scheme of things, especially in the context of my position as messenger (with a lower case “m”). I didn’t know if that was how Managers at that time were taught to behave, but I noticed that most managers would almost always maintain a certain distance between them and their subordinates. Many were autocratic, spoke in measured manner and tone, and could not care less how demeaning they would often treat other people. Fortunately, in 1960, Douglas McGregor wrote a book that helped me change my outlook about management. He was a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the 1950s and 1960s, and his book was called, “The Human Side of Enterprise.” McGregor proposed that there are two alternative ways by which managers perceive and address employee motivation. According to McGregor, Theory X management assumes that people dislike work and will avoid it if they could; that people are not ambitious and would rather be directed; and that people are gullible, resist change, and should be coerced and controlled if you expect them to help achieve organizational goals. Conversely, Theory Y management assumes that people consider work as natural as play and rest, are responsible and, given the right conditions, will seek responsibility. People can be committed to achieve quality and productivity goals if the right rewards are in place. It was McGregor who first pointed out that a “command-and-control” environment is not effective. In early corporate America, “command-and-control” was the norm — thanks to retired Generals who were rewarded with corporate positions after World War 2. McGregor thought that the essence of “command-and-control” relies on lower needs for motivation, which are mostly satisfied already among the majority of employees. This theory was a corollary to Abraham Maslow’s “Hierarchy of Needs Theory.” When employees lose their motivation, they will tend to dislike their work, avoid responsibility, resist change, etc. That creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Change drivers
Among enlightened managers, McGregor’s simple concept was a game changer. Over the years, when the “profession” of management developed to its fullness in the 1980s and 1990s, a bunch of enlightened Theory Y managers created a critical mass that swayed the practice of management towards how we experience it today. Also, there are significant change drivers that forced the practice of management to change. First is technology. The management practice championed by Frederick Winslow Taylor during the First Industrial Revolution was based on the technology in the days of Henry Ford, who leveraged the production line for utmost efficiency. Today and in the future, the Internet of Things will have a tremendous impact on the way managers will relate with their subordinates. In fact, even the face of management is now changing. In some cases, and where robotics and artificial intelligence have fully set into workplace processes, subordinates are already taking orders from C-3PO (the speaking, walking humanoid robot in “Star Wars”). Lest human managers and supervisors become irrelevant, they must be tech savvy now and in the future. To stay relevant, managers must have empathy and compassion — something that robot supervisors still don’t have. Second is information. As information almost doubles every year, it has become a most important global resource. Managers must have information at their fingertips in order to manage effectively. Enough said! The third is the changing demographics. Today, the majority of the inhabitants of the workplace are between their 20s and 30s. The elderly managers must adjust their management style to make these workplace inhabitants tick. Enough said, too! Managing in the next normal
Management and leadership will continue to change, as the business of doing business changes. In the next normal, managers must be able to adapt to the changing environment or C-3PO will take their jobs. Here are some of the requisites for managing in the next normal: – Caring. The Covid-19 pandemic provided lessons that managers did not learn in Management 101. Henceforth, managers are expected to be deeply concerned about employees’ safety, health and overall well-being. People expect to work in a safe environment that offers them not just ample pay and benefits, but a sense of belonging, social contact and a semblance of normalcy. – Character and integrity. Employees prefer to work with managers who share the same values with them. Managers must live and demonstrate in no uncertain terms the Company’s mission and values, in a way that people can feel and empathize with. While being transparent with organizational and environmental realities, managers must exude optimism and hope, inspire, and motivate their people. – Competence. Skills are the new currency of the future. Emerging managerial roles require an elaborate mix of hard and soft skills. While intelligence quotient (IQ) remains constant, emotional quotient (EQ) can be developed and improved over time. EQ and adversity quotient (AQ) are among the soft skills that will help managers succeed when the going gets tougher. Managers must indulge in intentional lifelong learning in order to stay sharp, smart, and relevant. – Crisis-proofing. Businesses, brands and people that survive during crises are generally purpose-driven. Revisit your purpose; find a niche that is aligned with your purpose. Managers must develop resilient strategies for business continuity and sustainability. In like manner, they should develop even more creative strategies for career continuity and sustainability. Amid the growing uncertainty, managers must learn to adapt to the neck-breaking speed at which changes in the global environment occur. In a recent online management and leadership forum, I told managers to “[c]hallenge your current assumptions about management and leadership in the next normal. When the smoke clears, we could be seeing a different landscape in the workplace that will require a different set of managerial and leadership skills. Upskill and reskill to be relevant.” Obviously, there are new and emerging dimensions in management that were different from what Taylor, Ford, McGregor and Maslow saw during their time. This is the time for “new management” in uncertain times. Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, said, “There are four ingredients in true leadership: brains, soul, heart and good nerves.” The whole world is still in deep trouble. Perhaps, it should be “Under New Management.” Ernie Cecilia is the chairman of the Human Capital Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (AMCHAM); Co-Chairman of the Employers Confederation of the Philippines’ (ECOP’s) TWG on Labor Policy and Social Issues; and past president of the People Management Association of the Philippines (PMAP).

(Xinhua/Asigang) The vaccine donation was welcomed at the Chinggis Khaan International Airport in Mongolia’s capital city of Ulan Bator by Mongolian Deputy Prime Minister Sainbuyan Amarsaikhan and Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Chai Wenrui. “On behalf of the Mongolian government and people, I would like to express my deep gratitude to China, our friendly neighbor and comprehensive strategic partner, for extending its helping hand during this difficult time,” said Amarsaikhan. “There is a Mongolian saying that goes, ‘Close neighbors have one life, far away neighbors have one mind.’ Since the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, Mongolia and China have provided each other with material and emotional support, which is a real example of how neighboring countries are overcoming difficulties together,” he said. For his part, Chai said, “The current global vaccine supply and demand are very tight. China has overcome difficulties when its own vaccine supply is not sufficient, and has not hesitated to give 300,000 doses of vaccine to Mongolia free of charge, which shows that China attaches great importance to China-Mongolia relations and the friendship between the two peoples.” The Chinese ambassador expressed confidence that these vaccines will contribute to the protection of people’s lives and the fight against the pandemic in Mongolia. Mongolia is planning to vaccinate at least 60 percent of its 3.3 million people, or all adults in the country, against the coronavirus, with 20 percent of them to be vaccinated under COVAX, a global initiative to ensure quick and equal access to vaccines against the virus, according to the country’s health ministry. The Asian country is expected to launch a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign on Tuesday. As of Monday, the country recorded 2,693 COVID-19 cases, with six deaths."

The patient, Gabriella Forgione, wasn’t complaining. The 25-year-old pharmacy worker was happy to be prodded and poked at the hospital in Nice, in southern France, to advance her increasingly pressing quest to recover her sense of smell. Along with her sense of taste, it suddenly vanished when she fell ill with Covid-19 in November, and neither has returned. Being deprived of the pleasures of food and the scents of things that she loves are proving tough on her body and mind. Shorn of odors both good and bad, Forgione is losing weight and self-confidence. “Sometimes I ask myself, ‘Do I stink?'” she confessed. “Normally, I wear perfume and like for things to smell nice. Not being able to smell bothers me greatly.” A year into the coronavirus pandemic, doctors and researchers are still striving to better understand and treat the accompanying epidemic of Covid-19-related anosmia — loss of smell — draining much of the joy of life from an increasing number of sensorially frustrated longer-term sufferers like Forgione. Gabriella Forgione, a 25-year-old patient, holds still as a doctor slides a miniature camera up her nose during tests in a hospital in Nice, France on Monday, Feb. 8, 2021, to help determine why she has been unable to smell or taste since she contracted Covid-19 in November 2020. AP PHOTO Even specialist doctors say there is much about the condition they still don’t know and they are learning as they go along in their diagnoses and treatments. Impairment and alteration of smell have become so common with Covid-19 that some researchers suggest that simple odor tests could be used to track coronavirus infections in countries with few laboratories. For most people, the olfactory problems are temporary, often improving on their own in weeks. But a small minority are complaining of persistent dysfunction long after other Covid-19 symptoms have disappeared. Some have reported continued total or partial loss of smell six months after infection. The longest, some doctors say, are now approaching a full year. Researchers working on the vexing disability say they are optimistic that most will eventually recover but fear some will not. Some doctors are concerned that growing numbers of smell-deprived patients, many of them young, could be more prone to depression and other difficulties and weigh on strained health systems. “They are losing color in their lives,” said Dr. Thomas Hummel, who heads the smell and taste outpatients clinic at University Hospital in Dresden, Germany. “These people will survive and they’ll be successful in their lives, in their professions,” Hummel added. “But their lives will be much poorer.” At the Face and Neck University Institute in Nice, Dr. Clair Vandersteen wafted tube after tube of odors under Forgione’s nose after he had rooted around in her nostrils with his camera. “Do you perceive any smell? Nothing? Zero? OK,” he asked, as she repeatedly and apologetically responded with negatives. Only the last tube provoked an unequivocal reaction. “Urgh! Oh, that stinks,” Forgione yelped. “Fish!” Test complete, Vandersteen delivered his diagnosis. “You need an enormous amount of an odor to be able to smell something,” he told her. “You haven’t completely lost your sense of smell but nor is it good.” The hand of Dr. Clair Vandersteen wafts a tube of odors under the nose of a blindfolded patient, Gabriella Forgione, during tests in a hospital in Nice, southern France, Monday, Feb. 8, 2021. AP PHOTO He sent her away with homework: six months of olfactory rehab. Twice daily, choose two or three scented things, like a sprig of lavender or jars of fragrances, and smell them for two to three minutes, he ordered. “If you smell something, great. If not, no problem. Try again, concentrating hard on picturing the lavender, a beautiful purple bloom,” he said. “You have to persevere.” Losing the sense of smell can be more than a mere inconvenience. Smoke from a spreading fire, a gas leak, or the stink of rotten food can all pass dangerously unnoticed. Fumes from a used diaper, dog’s dirt on a shoe or sweaty armpits can be embarrassingly ignored. And as poets have long known, scents and emotions are often like lovers entwined. Evan Cesa used to relish meal times. Now they’re a chore. A fish dinner in September that suddenly seemed flavorless first flagged to the 18-year-old sports student that COVID-19 had attacked his senses. Foodstuffs became mere textures, with only residual hints of sweet and saltiness. Five months later, breakfasting on chocolate cookies before classes, Cesa still chewed without joy, as though swallowing cardboard. “Eating no longer has any purpose for me,” he said. “It is just a waste of time.” Cesa is among the anosmia sufferers being studied by researchers in Nice who, before the pandemic, had been using scents in the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. They also used comforting fragrances to treat post-traumatic stress among children after a truck terror attack in Nice in 2016, when a driver plowed through holiday crowds, killing 86 people. Dr. Clair Vandersteen (right) wafts a tube of odors under the nose of a patient, Gabriella Forgione. AP PHOTO The researchers are now turning their expertise to Covid-19, teaming up with perfumers from the nearby fragrance-producing town of Grasse. Perfumer Aude Galouye worked on the fragrant waxes that were wafted under Cesa’s nose to measure his olfactory impairment, with scents at varying concentrations. “The sense of smell is a sense that is fundamentally forgotten,” Galouye said. “We don’t realize the effect it has on our lives except, obviously, when we no longer have it.” The examinations on Cesa and other patients also include language and attention tests. The Nice researchers are exploring whether olfactory complaints are linked to Covid-related cognitive difficulties, including problems with concentrating. Cesa stumbled by picking the word “ship” when “kayak” was the obvious choice on one test. “That is completely unexpected,” said Magali Payne, a speech therapist on the team. “This young man shouldn’t be experiencing linguistic problems.” “We have to keep digging,” she said. “We are finding things out as we see patients.” Cesa longs to have his senses restored, to celebrate the taste of pasta in carbonara sauce, his favorite dish, and a run through the fragrant wonders of the great outdoors. “One might think that it is not important to be able to smell nature, trees, forests,” he said. “But when you lose the sense of smell, you realize how truly lucky we are to be able to smell these things.”"

Gonzales,"February 22, 2021","Widen amusement tax coverage, LGUs told","A think tank suggested expanding the coverage of amusement taxes that local government units (LGUs) can impose to include streaming shows as they look for other means to increase their sources of revenues amid the coronavirus pandemic. In a report over the weekend, the National Tax Research Center (NTRC) said local governments need more of these sources to finance their various programs and continue serving their constituents as the Covid-19 crisis persisted. It suggested broadening the scope of the local amusement tax as a way to boost earnings, as “LGUs should not only rely on the fiscal support and allocations from the national government.” Revenue collections from amusement taxes may be insignificant compared to others, but these still contribute to state coffers, the think tank emphasized. Local and national amusement taxes collected reached P887.72 million and P134.50 million, respectively, from 2014 to 2018, according to the report. The cancellation of several entertainment events on account of the pandemic resulted in lower revenues in the Greater Manila Area, where almost half of these came from. The government banned them at the onset of the pandemic, as they encourage mass gatherings that would allow the coronavirus to spread. The estimated revenue loss from taxes collected from SM Prime Holdings Inc. — which operates the Sy Group’s shopping malls, as well as cinemas — alone amounted to P376.39 million at end-September 2020. “As it stands and as construed by the Supreme Court in various cases, Section 140 of the LGC (Local Government Code) of 1991, as amended, is limited only to theaters, cinemas, concert halls, circuses and other places of amusement where one seeks admission to entertain oneself by seeing or viewing the show or performance,” the report said. “In this regard, the coverage of local amusement tax may be broadened to include places that may be considered as places of amusement. In addition, the phrase ‘places of amusement’ must be defined appropriately so as to include other establishments that may be considered as such,” it added. While the pandemic suspended or canceled most shows and programs, there are online streaming shows that can be regarded as sources of amusement, according to the NTRC, noting that people are watching them at home amid the state-imposed mobility restrictions. “The LGUs can tap these sites as sources of tax revenues as the country [adapts to] the new normal,” it said. “LGUs need a broader range of revenue tools. These should include revenue sources that automatically grow with the economy, and at present live streaming may be closely considered as an additional revenue source of LGUs,” the think tank added. “However, it is crucial that social and economic issues are taken into consideration so that new funding sources shift costs fairly on those who can most afford to pay.” The administrative aspect of imposing this tax should also be considered, according to the NTRC. “Congress should consider reviewing the LGC of 1991, as amended, to align the limitations and taxing powers of LGUs to modern business models. For instance, expanding the coverage of local amusement tax may be explored by policymakers to provide additional revenue to LGUs,” it said. “Expanding the local amusement tax coverage will give sufficient leeway for the local sanggunian (council) to explore other activities that may be covered by the local amusement tax,” it added."

Of course, it is always better to be prepared. As Benjamin Franklin said, “By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.” But with delay after delay in the arrival, the dry runs are becoming less virtuous and more comedic.

PHOTO BY MIKE ALQUINTO Indeed, the latest from the Palace is that even President Rodrigo Duterte has grown impatient with the delays. That should have been reassuring, until we remember that he heads the government that is on the receiving end of the blame. Doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine from the Covax Facility were supposed to arrive by mid-February, but delivery was snagged because of vague issues surrounding the indemnity agreement. Also, the 600,000 doses of China’s Sinovac Biotech vaccine expected to arrive on February 23 may also be delayed because the manufacturer has yet to secure emergency use authorization from the local Food and Drug Administration. With frustration growing, the government now has to parry more criticisms than usual. Vice President Maria Leonor “Leni” Robredo, along with other government critics like Sen. Ana Theresia “Risa” Hontiveros, pointed out that even less developed countries like Bangladesh have started inoculations. The observation may be factual but perhaps out of context. Such statements only add to the absurd play and are helpful only in scoring cheap political points. United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres offered a broader perspective on the matter. He said he was alarmed by the global disparity of vaccine distribution. He pointed out that 130 countries have yet to receive vaccines, and that only 10 nations have administered 75 percent of the doses available. Guterres also appealed to the Group of 20 or G20 to bear more of the responsibility for financing and implementing vaccination programs around the world, saying the UN will provide them its full support. “If the virus is allowed to spread like wildfire in the Global South, it will mutate again and again. New variants could become more transmissible, more deadly and, potentially, threaten the effectiveness of current vaccines and diagnostics,” he explained in a story by Agence France-Presse. “This can prolong the pandemic significantly, enabling the virus to come back to plague the Global North.” Those fears are proving to be prophetic. Just on Saturday, The Manila Times reported that two new Covid-19 variants were discovered in Central Visayas. Health experts are still studying these variants, but mutations found elsewhere in the world seem to be more transmissible and virulent, possibly even resistant to the vaccines now being distributed. Consequences of delays Besides more people falling ill or dying, the delays in vaccination will likely spawn black markets and encourage criminal activities. That may already be happening, and if this is true, the situation becomes more complicated for the Duterte government. A few months ago, when media uncovered that the President’s security detail received Covid-19 shots that were smuggled into the country, there were also reports that thousands of Chinese expatriates and Chinese Filipinos had been vaccinated somehow. As we mentioned before in this space, a local black market for vaccines may have already emerged. With people desperate for protection from the pandemic and with the country eager to restart the economy, more may become susceptible to all sorts of schemes. Getting authentic vaccines through unlawful means is one thing, but what if people are duped into paying for fake shots or being injected with placebos? Can buyers tell whether they are getting a flu shot instead of a tested Covid-19 vaccine? Sadly, this issue subsided when President Duterte himself objected to an investigation of the Presidential Security Group (PSG). For the sake of protecting the PSG, there was no directive to look into the vaccine black market. That is yet another act in this unfolding horseplay. The public is distracted by the illusion of movement from simulations, but there is hardly any action. The government needs to get its act together somehow, despite the global issues. More than anything else, that would help bring down the curtains on this tiresome tragedy."

During the Laging Handa public briefing on state-run PTV-4 held on Friday, Lopez said that the Department of Trade and Industry’s (DTI) recommendation was based on its observation that those cinemas allowed to open in areas under modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) did not result in higher cases of the coronavirus disease 2019. “Remember, most of the areas in the country are under MGCQ and only about eight places, including the National Capital Region are in GCQ. In areas under MGCQ outside Metro Manila, cinemas are allowed to be open but our observations showed that it did not result in the spike of Covid-19 cases,” he said in Filipino. “Its all about … compliance to health protocols.” Lopez also said that the DTI’s push for cinemas’ reopening is just meant to sustain the gradual reopening of the economy. “We are not violating any laws here. If the LGUs (local government units) are not comfortable, lets start with allowing cinemas to operate at 20 or 30 percent capacity.

According to Dr. Cynthia Saloma, University of the Philippines-Philippine Genome Center (UP-PGC) director, the E484K and the N501Y mutations were detected in 31 out the 70 samples that came from the region during the sequencing made by the center on February 11. “These are mutations of global concern that were exhibited by variants of concern tulad ng nasa (like in) South Africa, yung sa Brazil and yung sa United Kingdom,” Saloma said in a press conference on Friday. Saloma said the “silent” mutation of the SARS-CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-coronavirus 2) virus was brought about by changes in the sequence of its deoxyribonucleic or ribonucleic acid (DNA/RNA) pairs, and can either cause a loss, gain in function or possibly no change at all. The variants are considered viruses that developed from a specific group of mutations, causing them to behave differently from the strain they originated from. Both mutations can either increase the transmission of Covid-19 and reduce the efficacy of the current vaccines in use, according to Saloma. The cases with these mutations had only exhibited mild symptoms and were cleared. Saloma added that the PGC Genomic Biosurveillance team and the DoH epidemiology bureau will now closely check the genome sequences of the samples and monitor the cases that had been infected with these mutations. Despite the discovery of the new mutations in Central Visayas, Health Secretary Francisco Duque 3rd said that this may not affect Metro Manila’s planned shift to modified general community quarantine (MGCQ) by March 1 as long as the region is careful in enforcing a more relaxed status. “We have to scale up even more in the light of these variants… our massive promotion to let the public comply with all of our minimum public health standards, and the aggressive early detection by way of testing, tracing and isolation,” Duque said."
68,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/19/opinion/columnists/secure-and-insecure-citizenship/842604/,Stephen CuUnjieng,"February 19, 2021",Secure and insecure citizenship,"I WAS debating whether to write another article on Covid-19 having first read a very intelligent article in The Atlantic and given the misinformation being peddled by others. There are those who for their personal reasons have an ideological bias that overcomes fact and reason, but I decided against another article that would marginally be bringing up new points given all the major ones that have already been set forth. Maybe if it was substantially on points not previously raised or new verified information rather than rehashing whatever one’s bias dictates and quoting prejudiced sources. On the topic, I am not discussing what is the way we should apply our citizenship laws. While I did work at the Romulo Law Office and passed the bar, my legal career ended in 1984, and I do not pretend to be up to date or remember enough of what I was ably taught decades ago. This is about our attitude toward citizenship and contrast that with others. Many may take issue with my observations, but that is what reasoned discourse is about. I have observed that generally, the more secure a country is, the more liberal their citizenship laws. The less differences in citizenship rights between natural and naturalized, the more open-minded their attitude toward citizenship is. Same is true on how straightforward and open the country is to naturalization. An exception to this is Japan, where like the Philippines one only gets citizenship through jus sanguinis (bloodline — so a parent must be a citizen to bestow citizenship on a child) vs jus soli (where you are born). Places like the US and UK give both jus sanguinis and soli. In Japan you have people who legally work and stay there for generations but because of bloodline never become citizens. That would be the case here as well unless you opt for naturalization. Ironically, it often seems the stricter the citizenship laws, the less desirable the country often is for citizenship anyway. These tend to be the jus sanguinis only countries. Jus soli or jus sanguinis
Why do countries like the US (though the nativist and racist Trump talked about changing it and fortunately his losing ends that immediate fear) apply jus soli? Why do they grant citizenship if you were born there and have for immigrants a relatively straightforward path to citizenship? First, these tend to be countries that had high immigration in their formative years and encouraged it (though the US also has swung the other way under Trump and had its shameful racist periods like the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Japanese incarceration in times of backlash and xenophobia). Second, they tend to be successful and secure countries that argue if you stay here it is because you want to and believe it, to use the popular phrase, to be “the land of opportunity.” Let us not digress into talk among elites who argue about their privileges and so on here vs there. I am talking about opportunity in spite of challenges overall. Those countries are generally not worried that you are going there to exploit the country. You are going there to be part of it. You have bought into their narrative or at least believe that for all the challenges, the opportunities there are better than back home. My one digression that really gets me angry is when people tout the Philippines as paradise because you can have maids and personal help en masse. Guess what? Maybe it is paradise for those who have maids. It is far from paradise for the ones rendering the service. To many and I agree, it is a sign of advancement and civilization that there are enough opportunities in a country that many do not have to be domestic help and if they do so, are compensated enough so it is at least partially a choice rather than something one does for lack of choice or to survive. A paradise is one that is paradise for all or most. Not some tiny sliver only. When my family and I lived in the US, we had no live-in or full-time help. If you needed or wanted someone to come in to clean the house or mow the lawn you contracted with a service, and they would come over, often as a team and do what they needed to in a few hours and then would come back depending on your schedule weekly or as one needed or scheduled. In New York City, it is often an individual rather than a team given most have apartments. Also, the society is structured so you do not need live-in or permanent help to have a comfortable life. The only exception is if you have very young children; then the need to arrange reliable baby-sitters is a chore and can be a challenge. Hence one often sees parents bringing their infants with them to restaurants, cinemas and the like. Related to this is the comment I often hear which is, why do Filipinos do well when abroad? I think it is in large part that our country, 75 years after independence, has not delivered for its ever-increasing population. In our region, Malaysia and Thailand have and Vietnam is clearly on its way to doing so. I remember being so proud after 1986 and so sad for China after 1989. Let us be blunt, absent surface political rights (and I say surface and superficial because who really benefits and can make use of our democratic rights), who is better off if we take conditions prevailing in 1990 as the starting point? On both an individual and country level — the Philippines or China? The answer except for political dissidents is so sadly and blatantly obvious. To go back to the question, why do Filipinos do well abroad while the country underperforms? I used to say, the biggest vote in the Philippines is not the vote for this or that candidate. It is the vote to leave, which tens of millions of Filipinos have taken and continue to take. In my view, Filipinos do well abroad for two reasons — simply because they are incentivized to do so and generally those who go abroad are the more aggressive and adventurous ones. Let us assume you are in a middle position, not happy but not unhappy. Which type of person chooses to stay and which chooses to try something different elsewhere? Who is willing to be away from their families, friends, comfort zone and environment? The latter might not be smarter or wiser and it may be the wrong decision, but that person is definitely more adventurous and open to new ideas and challenges. Guess what? That is what they say in other countries as well, where there is a diaspora until the home country becomes successful and many return home. Natural-born vs naturalized
An offshoot of this is the different rights of natural-born and naturalized citizens. In the US, I think the only differentiator I know is that only a natural-born citizen can be president and if there was fraud in the naturalization process, citizenship can be rescinded. A natural-born citizen cannot have this citizenship removed or revoked. The US requires certain industries like media and transportation and their CEOs to be American. They do not distinguish between natural and naturalized. When he bought the New York Post decades ago, Rupert Murdoch acquired American citizenship to enable himself to be a publisher. Same thing with elected and appointed government officials below president. There was even some fringe speculation during Watergate after VP Agnew resigned that Nixon appointed Kissinger who was a naturalized citizen as vice president as he could not run for and be elected president but if Nixon resigned, he could become president. Don’t know if that view was accurate and many who detest Kissinger would have been aghast if it had happened, but it did not come to pass. Yet some writers speculated on it. Dual citizens
This is another thing secure countries are relaxed about. Mark Carney was the governor of the Central Bank of Canada from 2008 to 2013. Having done an exemplary job and being a dual citizen of Canada and the United Kingdom, he was then made governor of the Bank of England from 2013 to 2020. Economist Stanley Fischer, who was born in what is now Zambia (the former Northern Rhodesia) has dual citizenship — Israeli and American. He was chief economist of the World Bank, then from 2005 to 2013 was governor of the Bank of Israel. In 2014, President Obama appointed him vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. He stepped down for personal reasons in 2017. Jennifer Granholm is both a Canadian and naturalized American citizen and was born in Canada. She was elected and served as governor of Michigan from 2003 to 2011 and has now been appointed secretary of energy by President Biden. What is my point behind these examples? The US, the UK, Canada and Israel did not care if they were dual citizens or naturalized. They just wanted the best and most qualified citizens. Why exclude citizens based on having more than one citizenship or being naturalized? I would suggest in a country like ours, where so many left for opportunity and necessity, why discriminate against them if they want to engage in public service when they return? Recovery of citizenship was a good step but why be so insecure and stop there? The same for naturalized citizens. You must really want to be part of the country if you take an actual step of taking citizenship. If one argues but they left or they got naturalized for opportunistic reasons, my answer is so what? If they are lousy or disloyal, then remove them or vote them out. Are we that insecure? Or jealous?"

The UN chief told a high-level meeting of the UN Security Council that 130 countries have not received a single dose of vaccine and declared that “at this critical moment, vaccine equity is the biggest moral test before the global community.” Guterres called for an urgent Global Vaccination Plan to bring together those with the power to ensure fair vaccine distribution — scientists, vaccine producers and those who can fund the effort. The secretary-general called on the world’s major economic powers in the Group of 20 to establish an emergency task force to establish a plan and coordinate its implementation and financing. He said the task force should have the capacity “to mobilize the pharmaceutical companies and key industry and logistics actors.” Guterres said Friday’s meeting of the Group of Seven major industrialized nations “can create the momentum to mobilize the necessary financial resources.” British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, whose country holds the Security Council presidency this month, urged the UN’s most powerful body to adopt a resolution calling for ceasefires in conflict zones to allow the delivery of Covid-19 vaccines. Thirteen ministers were scheduled to address the meeting on improving access to Covid-19 including US Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Britain says more than 160 million people are at risk of being excluded from coronavirus vaccinations because they live in countries engulfed in conflict and instability, including Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia. “Global vaccination coverage is essential to beating coronavirus,” Raab said ahead of the meeting. “That is why the UK is calling for a vaccination cease-fire to allow Covid-19 vaccines to reach people living in conflict zones and for a greater global team effort to deliver equitable access.” Britain’s UN ambassador, Barbara Woodward said: “Humanitarian organizations and UN agencies need the full backing of the council to be able to carry out the job we are asking them to do.” Woodward said cease-fires have been used to carry out vaccinations, pointing to a two-day pause in fighting in Afghanistan in 2001 that enabled 35,000 health workers and volunteers to vaccinate 5.7 million children under the age of 5 against polio. Britain has drafted a Security Council resolution that Woodward said the UK hopes will be adopted in the coming weeks. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Tuesday that Mexico will stress the importance of equal access for all countries to Covid-19 vaccines at the council meeting. He was sharply critical that countries that produce the vaccine have high vaccination rates while Latin American countries have problems obtaining any vaccines. The coronavirus has infected more than 109 million people and killed at least 2.4 million of them. But many countries have not yet started vaccination programs and even rich nations are facing shortages of vaccine doses as manufacturers struggle to ramp up production. The World Health Organization’s COVAX program, an ambitious project to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world’s poorest people, has already missed its own goal of beginning coronavirus vaccinations in poor countries at the same time that shots were rolled out in rich countries. Numerous developing countries have rushed in recent weeks to sign their own private deals to buy vaccines, unwilling to wait for COVAX. Woodward said Britain supports reserving 5% of COVAX doses as a “last resort” buffer to ensure that high-risk populations have access to Covid-19 vaccines."
70,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/18/campus-press/are-supervisors-still-relevant-in-the-next-normal/842225/,"Ernie Cecilia, DPM","February 18, 2021",Are supervisors still relevant in the next normal?,"Almost a year ago, Josh Dzieza, investigations editor and feature writer at “The Verge,” wrote an article that could scare today’s Supervisors. The handwriting on the wall looks clear, “In warehouses, call centers and other sectors, intelligent machines are managing humans, and they’re making work more stressful, grueling, and dangerous.” Robo-bosses
Dzieza continues, “The robots are watching over hotel housekeepers, telling them which room to clean and tracking how quickly they do it. They’re managing software developers, monitoring their clicks and scrolls and docking their pay if they work too slowly. They’re listening to call center workers, telling them what to say, how to say it, and keeping them constantly, maximally busy. While we’ve been watching the horizon for the self-driving trucks, perpetually five years away, the robots arrived in the form of the supervisor, the foreman, the middle manager.” Robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) have arrived, and workers in many countries are worried. Dzieza said, “For many of them, their greatest fear isn’t that robots might come for their jobs: it’s that robots have already become their boss.” While many employees detest the thought of being supervised by a robot, a recent survey by Kevin Kruse, CEO of LEADx, revealed that more than 20 percent of workers would want to replace their boss with a generic robot. The LEADx survey results could be unsettling for some supervisors, considering that supervisors have come a long way since the medieval times and have been permanent fixtures in today’s workplace. Origin of supervisor
According to Wikipedia, the word “supervisor” came from the Medieval Latin verb “supervidēre,” meaning “to oversee.” The prefix super (also supra) means “over” or “above”, while the Latin vidēre means “to see.” Literally, to supervise means to see from above. The supervisor is also known by several names — foreman, boss, overseer, monitor, area coordinator or sometimes “gaffer.” In the factory, the supervisor is in a low-level management position. In the academe, the supervisor could be one of the most senior in the staff, such as a Professor who oversees a PhD dissertation. Sometimes, people in the same job grade as the Supervisor are also classified as supervisors, even if they do not supervise other people. Supervisors’ dilemma
Perhaps, supervisors are one of the most misunderstood and stressed people in the workplace. They have productivity-conscious bosses above them and sometimes uncooperative subordinates below them. They’re like the “bibingka,” the Filipino rice cake cooked with fire under it and burning coal on top of it. The first time I was promoted to be a supervisor came as a surprise. I had no training to be one. It seemed that my boss perceived how good I was at doing my clerical tasks. As a reward, I was promoted! Then my headaches began. Here’s why: Like I said, I never had any supervisory skills training before I got promoted. It felt like I was thrown into the pool, and I heard my boss shouting, “Swim!” I was good at technical work, but I never did management or supervisory work. The scope of my job was unclear at first. My friends and fellow employees suddenly became my subordinates. I was not sure if they were ready to accept me as their boss. My sense sometimes told me that some, not all, resented my promotion since many of them had more seniority and longevity in the company. Suddenly, I had two jobs — doing my own and minding the jobs of others. Somehow, I thought that I was programmed to be a rank and file. I had to reprogram my thinking and thought process to be like a manager. It was tough without support from my Manager. To those supervisors who now experience the same dilemma I encountered early in my career, here are some suggestions you might find useful: – Role clarification. First understand your new role — including what you’re supposed to do and what you’re not supposed to do. Ask your boss about his/her expectations and the limits of your authority. Once you’re clear on the parameters with your boss, clarify the same with your subordinates. Whenever possible, take time to discuss this with your subordinates as a group and on a one-on-one basis. Listen to their reactions — verbal and nonverbal — and to what is not being said. – Remain professional at all times. As a new “boss,” you need to establish professional working relationships with your bosses, peers and subordinates. Focus on issues and the tasks at hand, rather than on personalities. Do not shoot the messenger who brings you unsavory news. Be seen as a leader and enabler of others – not bossy, not pushing too hard. – Refrain from office politics. At all cost, avoid corridor or water-cooler politics. Do not side with one party to a dispute that you must arbitrate. Remain neutral, objective and fair always. Don’t get tempted to listen to juicy gossip, lest one day you’re subject of it, too. – Raise your managerial skills. Always sharpen your saw, as Covey said. While the management principles hardly change, the practice is influenced by a number of change drivers in business and in life. Continue to be a student of the art and science of management. Learn the science and adapt it to your working environment. C-3PO as boss?
First-time supervisors must not be wary about lack of supervisory, managerial or leadership skills. They are easily learned from the right sources. What is more worrisome is the development in technology that enables the machines to take over the supervisors’ jobs. The other aspect to worry about is the reaction of workers to the idea of changing a human supervisor with a robot. The younger employees are more willing and ready to trade their current boss with C-3PO. Many employees join a company. But Gallup says employees resign from their bosses. The Gallup survey speaks volumes. Bad bosses are perhaps the major reason for low employee engagement. The LEADx survey says that roughly 30 percent of employees would replace their boss with a friendly humanoid robot-like C-3PO. Recent employee engagement surveys confirm that 30 percent of employees worldwide are disengaged. Coincidence? The LEADx survey revealed the main reasons why employees would replace their bosses with robots: a) they don’t like their boss; 2) their boss is biased; 3) their boss lacks competence; and 4) their boss lacks people skills and empathy. The onus is on supervisors to prove that they are still relevant in the workplace now and in the future. Obviously, humans have characteristics that robots still don’t have, as we write. If the developers and programmers can find a way to program empathy, compassion and love into the DNA of the robots, the supervisors would be among the endangered species. The surveys tend to send a strong warning. People, especially the young, are willing to work with technology, especially in humanoid form, perhaps like Daryl (Data Analyzing Robot Youth Lifeform) in the 1985 movie. People will prefer to have a robot boss if it means getting rid of their bad supervisor. To good supervisors, I say that there’s still a niche for you. As Brian Tracy said, “Only about two percent of people can work entirely without supervision. We call them Leaders.” To the employees, I reiterate my long-time admonition, “Take care of your boss now, the next could be worse — or not human.” Ernie Cecilia is the chairman of the Human Capital Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (AMCHAM); Co-Chairman of the Employers Confederation of the Philippines’ (ECOP’s) TWG on Labor Policy and Social Issues; and past president of the People Management Association of the Philippines (PMAP).

When the sun goes down, the stars will come out. – Anon THE pandemic has punctuated our equilibrium. Applied to various life areas such as in the disciplines — in physics, psychology, economics, management, etc., the term “equilibrium” means balance. Physics-wise, if the resultant of forces on opposite sides of the lever is zero, then there is equilibrium. This pandemic: A punctuated equilibrium. We are witnessing a punctuated equilibrium that has slammed aspects of life. Supply and demand such as for food and health out balance each other; unstable prices of such goods results. Psychology-wise, our mental schemata do not fit the actual environment we are in, be this in our cultural, physical or social environment. Our expectations based on the normal life we knew are incredibly incompatible with the new normal life the pandemic brought about. We need cognitive equilibrium to provide us an intellectual and emotional balance. The social distancing protocols and economic concerns caused by Covid-19 have imposed on us feelings of personal isolation and uncertainty. Obviously, to keep our sanity, we do need equilibrium. Punctuated equilibrium. As we try to calm our nerves in adjusting to this new normal, what can we do to redirect this seismic change? Let us draw understanding of this pandemic from the origin of what paleontologists identified as punctuated equilibrium (PE). The data base explains that there were five PE’s in the last 500 million years. It was a huge meteor or volcanic fury or both, as earth history explains, that caused the ecosystem to change drastically causing the dinosaurs to die. There were a few cold-blooded reptile survivors including crocodiles, but the new ecosystem favored the warm-blooded mammals. Why, because they were able to adapt to the severe weather changes. The PE theory “brings about change,” “after long periods of stability in the characteristics of an organism.” Then comes “short periods of rapid change during which new forms appear.” <dictionary. cambridge.org › dictionary › english › punct…> Similarly, in this pandemic, we are experiencing drastic change. “So, what should be our response to this equilibrium that has been punctuated in our ecosystem? Are we like dinosaurs, or mammals?” Why did the mammals thrive, besides luck? The answer is “Adaptability, adaptability and adaptability.” <www.thoughtworks. com › insights › blog › surviving-o..>. Adapting, would mean a change — a change in us? The equilibrium we need. It is not only a change on market forces that we would seek in the next stage of this pandemic. After a few months of relative calm, “we’ve started to see some striking evolution” of the virus. Biologist Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle wrote of the new strains on Twitter last week. <www.manila times.net › 2021/01/ 20 › news › national>. Unlettered about viruses, most of us did not expect the rise of Covid-19 mutations. They imply an uncertain end of the pandemic, threatening everyone’s psychological health. Gripped with constant fear of contracting the virus or its mutations, we worry over total loss of livelihood, disruption of quality education, a prolonged restriction of social contact, and a host of other uncertainties. Anxiety and/or depression impacts on us both as individuals and on our communities. To lift our spirits, let us count on the positives — the communal spirit of the Filipino which has openly asserted itself many times over. The nimble way is another welcomed change, unlike in prepandemic days, of more government departments in attending to healthcare, education and work interventions to battle with stress and sickness. While physical distance protocol narrows our social life, let’s be thankful for more time we gain for family, creating meaningful relations that we may have failed to nurture due to our professional activities. And thanks for increased awareness to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases emissions. All these positive developments, we hope would be sustained as we, with much uncertainty, try to adapt to the new normal. Redirecting punctuated equilibrium. Unlike the dinosaurs during the biological PT, we are not experiencing evolving physically. Thankfully, we had temporary stability during massive lockdowns, making us quite used to quarantines; some businesses and tourist spots were allowed to open. However, this short-lived seemingly stable phase, being disturbed by the new pandemic strains coming down on hapless victims, is robbing us of hope that some good change is near at hand. The change we hope for, amidst this massive global-wide uncertainty, is a stable state if there will be. Sadly, the PT theory considered, it proved to be short-lived, punctuated. Thus, to calm our fears, let us stay resilient; hold tight to optimism. Nurture a sense of control. Converse with ourselves. Keep tab of [our] own emotions.” Let’s stay connected with our own family and friends. Bond with the wider community. Extend help where we can. Hold on to hope and faith. This is a challenging phase of the equilibrium. But out of this experience, there comes learning that can “help us build a bridge to the future that is beyond this current crisis.” <www.continuousbreakthruz.com› blog › punctuated-e…> Hold on to our faith and hope in Him. “And when such a future comes, let us be ready and willing to embrace the change.” Putting our heart and mind on this change could be the beginning of a creative tension to initiate a healthy transformation. “There will be no normal to come back to because it is us who will have changed! Our perspectives will have shifted.” In such a punctuated equilibrium, there still is a future to build! Email: ttumapon@liceo.edu.ph"

In an interview with state-run PTV-4, Palace spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) was crafting the do’s and don’ts for the possible transition to “new normal” of areas with zero transmission in the past month. “‘Yan naman po talaga ay napagusapan na ng ating IATF at ang inaantay lang po natin ay yung mga do’s and don’ts (That is being discussed by the IATF and we are just waiting for the dos and don’ts),” Roque said when asked of possibly declaring some areas under the “new normal.” Roque, who is also with the IATF, said he would raise again the declaration of the “new normal” in some areas when they meet again. “Hayaan niyo po, sa susunod na IATF [meeting] ay bubuksan ko po muli itong usapin na ito dahil tayo po talaga yung nag move na magdeklara na tayo ng new normal sa mga lugar na wala na pong transmission ng Covid-19 (Don’t worry, in the next IATF meeting, I will once again open this topic because we are the one that moved to declare new normal in areas that no longer have Covid-19 transmission),” he said. “Meron naman po tayong mga lugar na natigil na po ang transmission ng Covid-19 (There are now areas where the Covid-19 transmission already stopped),” he added, without providing other details as to which areas in the country have no coronavirus transmissions. The “new normal” classification used to be the fifth, lowest quarantine classification before the IATF removed it in June. According to IATF’s guidelines on the implementation of community quarantine, “new normal” refers to “emerging behaviors, situations, and minimum public health standards that will be institutionalized in common or routine practices and remain even after the pandemic while the disease is not totally eradicated through means such as widespread immunization.” “These include actions that will become second nature to the general public as well as policies such as bans on large gatherings that will continue to remain in force,” it added. To date, there are only four levels of community quarantine: enhanced community quarantine, which is the strictest; modified enhanced community quarantine, general community quarantine (GCQ), and the modified general community quarantine (MGCQ). For the month of February, areas under GCQ are Metro Manila, Cordillera Administrative Region, Batangas, Tacloban City, Iligan City, Davao del Norte, Davao City, and Lanao del Sur. The rest of the country is currently under MGCQ, the most lenient quarantine classification and the phase before the “new normal.” Current community quarantine classifications are set to lapse after February 28. As of Monday, the country has over 550,000 cases of the coronavirus. Over 510,000 have recovered, while more than 11,000 have died from the disease."

Viruses mutate constantly and it takes just the right combination of particular mutations to escape vaccination. But studies are raising concern that first-generation Covid-19 vaccines don’t work as well against a mutant that first emerged in South Africa as they do against other versions circulating around the world. The good news: Many of the new Covid-19 vaccines are made with new, flexible technology that’s easy to upgrade. What’s harder: Deciding if the virus has mutated enough that it’s time to modify vaccines — and what changes to make. “When do you pull the trigger?” asked Norman Baylor, a former Food and Drug Administration vaccine chief. “This is a moving target right now.” The WHO and FDA are looking to the global flu vaccine system in deciding how to handle similar decisions about Covid-19 shots. Influenza mutates much faster than the coronavirus, and flu shots have to be adjusted just about every year. National centers around the globe collect circulating flu viruses and track how they’re evolving. They send samples to WHO-designated labs for more sophisticated “antigenic” testing to determine vaccine strength. The WHO and regulators then agree on the year’s vaccine recipe and manufacturers get to work. For Covid-19 vaccines, Webby said a critical step is establishing a similar surveillance and testing network to flag the mutations that matter. Today, there’s wide geographic variability in tracking and testing mutated versions. For example, Britain does more testing of the changing viral genome than the United States. Three variants first discovered in Britain, South Africa and Brazil are worrisome because of combinations of mutations that make them more contagious. On Sunday, US researchers reported a still different mutation found in seven variants that have cropped up in several states. No one yet knows if this mutation makes the virus easier to spread but the report, not yet vetted by other scientists, urges further research to find out. In this Jan. 22, 2021 file photo, empty vials of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine are seen at a vaccination center at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas. AP PHOTO Just because a variant is more contagious doesn’t mean it also will be impervious to vaccination. But the variant first identified in South Africa is raising concerns. Columbia University’s David Ho put blood samples from people given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines into lab dishes with the mutated virus. Vaccine-produced antibodies still protected, but they were much less potent. Preliminary test results of two other vaccine candidates — from Novavax and Johnson & Johnson — soon backed up those findings. Both still protected but were weaker when tested in South Africa, where that variant dominates, than when tested elsewhere. A far smaller test of the AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa has raised questions about its effect. “If the virus were able to make an additional mutation or two, it could escape even more,” Ho warned. If fully immunized people start getting hospitalized with mutated virus, “that’s when the line gets crossed,” said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia vaccine expert who advises the FDA. That hasn’t happened yet, but “we should get ready,” he added. Moderna is about to explore one option: Could a third dose of the original vaccine boost immunity enough to fend off some variants even if it’s not an exact match? Columbia’s Ho said it’s a good idea to test because people may “still have plenty of cushion” if their overall antibody levels are very high. In this Jan. 22, 2021 file photo, Tina Killebrew, a certified medical assistant, prepares a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine at a vaccination center at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. AP PHOTO Major manufacturers also are developing experimental variant vaccines, just in case. Covid-19 vaccines produce antibodies that recognize the spike protein that coats the coronavirus. When the virus mutates, sometimes the spike protein is changed in key areas so the vaccine-produced antibodies have a harder time recognizing it. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are made with a piece of genetic code called messenger RNA that tells the body how to make some harmless copies of the spike protein that train immune cells. To update the vaccine, they can simply change the payload: swap out the original genetic code with mRNA for the mutated spike protein. The AstraZeneca vaccine and the Johnson & Johnson shot expected to roll out soon are made with cold viruses engineered to sneak a spike protein gene into the body. Adjusting their vaccines requires growing cold viruses with the mutated gene, a little more complex than the mRNA approach but not nearly as laborious as reformulating old-fashioned flu shots. The Novavax vaccine also in final-stage testing is made with a lab-grown copy of the spike protein that also could be tweaked to match mutations. First-generation Covid-19 vaccines were tested in tens of thousands of people to be sure they work and are safe — research that took many months. Simply changing the recipe to better target virus mutations won’t require repeating those studies in thousands of people, Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA’s vaccine chief, recently told the American Medical Association. FDA still is finalizing requirements, but Marks said the agency intends to “be pretty nimble.” If an updated vaccine is needed, tests in a few hundred people likely would be enough to tell if it triggers a good immune response, he said. But an even bigger question: If only some places face vaccine-resistant virus mutants, would authorities want variant-only shots or vaccines that protect against two kinds in one jab? After all, flu vaccines protect against three or four different types in one shot. Companies would first have to perform some basic research to be sure a variant-only version properly revs up the immune system, said the Immunization Action Coalition’s John Grabenstein, a former Merck vaccine executive. Then a combination shot would need more testing to be sure there’s an equal response to both types."

Al-Mandhari said there are nearly 6 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the region and about 140,000 deaths. WHO urged people to continue taking precautionary measures against the virus. The organization said 6.3 million vaccinations have been administered in 12 countries in the eastern Mediterranean. “Vaccinations are a turning point in facing the virus but the vaccines alone are not enough,” al-Mandhari said, adding that social distancing, wearing masks and keeping clean remain the main ways to fight the spread of the virus. He said as many people as possible should be vaccinated before they come into contact with any of the new variants of the virus.

Experts say it’s likely that some version of the disease will linger for years. But what it will look like in the future is less clear. Will the coronavirus, which has already killed more than 2 million people worldwide, eventually be eliminated by a global vaccination campaign, like smallpox? Will dangerous new variants evade vaccines? Or will the virus stick around for a long time, transforming into a mild annoyance, like the common cold? Eventually, the virus known as SARS-CoV-2 will become yet “another animal in the zoo,” joining the many other infectious diseases that humanity has learned to live with, predicted Dr. T. Jacob John, who studies viruses and was at the helm of India’s efforts to tackle polio and HIV/AIDS.

Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Ted S. Warren, File) But no one knows for sure. The virus is evolving rapidly, and new variants are popping up in different countries. The risk of these new variants was underscored when Novavax Inc. found that the company’s vaccine did not work as well against mutated versions circulating in Britain and South Africa. The more the virus spreads, experts say, the more likely it is that a new variant will become capable of eluding current tests, treatments and vaccines. For now, scientists agree on the immediate priority: Vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible. The next step is less certain and depends largely on the strength of the immunity offered by vaccines and natural infections and how long it lasts. “Are people going to be frequently subject to repeat infections? We don’t have enough data yet to know,” said Jeffrey Shaman, who studies viruses at Columbia University. Like many researchers, he believes chances are slim that vaccines will confer lifelong immunity. If humans must learn to live with Covid-19, the nature of that coexistence depends not just on how long immunity lasts, but also how the virus evolves. Will it mutate significantly each year, requiring annual shots, like the flu? Or will it pop up every few years? This question of what happens next attracted Jennie Lavine, a virologist at Emory University, who is co-author of a recent paper in Science that projected a relatively optimistic scenario: After most people have been exposed to the virus — either through vaccination or surviving infections — the pathogen “will continue to circulate, but will mostly cause only mild illness,” like a routine cold. While immunity acquired from other coronaviruses — like those that cause the common cold or SARS or MERS — wanes over time, symptoms upon reinfection tend to be milder than the first illness, said Ottar Bjornstad, a co-author of the Science paper who studies viruses at Pennsylvania State University. “Adults tend not to get very bad symptoms if they’ve already been exposed,” he said.  FILE – In this Nov. 12, 2020, file photo, people walk in a market to shop ahead of the Diwalli festival in New Delhi, India. Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup, File) The prediction in the Science paper is based on an analysis of how other coronaviruses have behaved over time and assumes that SAR-CoV-2 continues to evolve, but not quickly or radically. The 1918 flu pandemic could offer clues about the course of Covid-19. That pathogen was an H1N1 virus with genes that originated in birds, not a coronavirus. At the time, no vaccines were available. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that a third of the world’s population became infected. Eventually, after infected people either died or developed immunity, the virus stopped spreading quickly. It later mutated into a less virulent form, which experts say continues to circulate seasonally. “Very commonly the descendants of flu pandemics become the milder seasonal flu viruses we experience for many years,” said Stephen Morse, who studies viruses at Columbia University. It’s not clear yet how future mutations in SARS-CoV-2 will shape the trajectory of the current disease. As new variants emerge — some more contagious, some more virulent and some possibly less responsive to vaccines — scientists are reminded how much they don’t yet know about the future of the virus, said Mark Jit, who studies viruses at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “We’ve only known about this virus for about a year, so we don’t yet have data to show its behavior over five years or 10 years,” he said. Of the more than 12 billion coronavirus vaccine shots being made in 2021, rich countries have bought about 9 billion, and many have options to buy more. This inequity is a threat since it will result in poorer countries having to wait longer for the vaccine, during which time the disease will continue to spread and kill people, said Ian MacKay, who studies viruses at the University of Queensland. A couple walk along a boulevard in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Jan. 17, 2021. Scientists say it’s still too early to predict the future of the coronavirus, but many doubt it will ever go away entirely. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) That some vaccines seem less effective against the new strains is worrisome, but since the shots provide some protection, vaccines could still be used to slow or stop the virus from spreading, said Ashley St. John, who studies immune systems at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India, said the evolution of the virus raises new questions: At what stage does the virus become a new strain? Will countries need to re-vaccinate from scratch? Or could a booster dose be given? “These are questions that you will have to address in the future,” Kang said. The future of the coronavirus may contrast with other highly contagious diseases that have been largely beaten by vaccines that provide lifelong immunity — such as measles. The spread of measles drops off after many people have been vaccinated. But the dynamic changes over time with new births, so outbreaks tend to come in cycles, explained Dr. Jayaprakash Muliyil, who studies epidemics and advises India on virus surveillance. Unlike measles, kids infected with Covid-19 don’t always exhibit clear symptoms and could still transmit the disease to vulnerable adults. That means countries cannot let their guard down, he said. Another unknown is the long-term impact of Covid-19 on patients who survive but are incapacitated for months, Kang said. The “quantification of this damage” — how many people can’t do manual labor or are so exhausted that they can’t concentrate — is key to understanding the full consequences of the disease. “We haven’t had a lot of diseases that have affected people on a scale like this,” she said."

There is also hate. In this image from video, Michael van der Veen, an attorney for former President Donald Trump, answers a question from Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., during the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump in the Senate at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Friday, Feb. 12, 2021. AP PHOTO US media recently reported an alarming increase of hate crimes committed against Asians and Asian Americans. These reports follow nearly a year’s worth of news about Black Lives Matter protests against the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, two of the many African Americans killed by law enforcers. Earlier this year, America, along with the rest of the world, was also shocked by protestors storming the US Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the certification of its presidential elections. They were successful, but only for a short while. Now, the immediate past US president Donald Trump is on trial after his second impeachment. Not a few are also blaming Mr. Trump for the increase in hate crimes. By referring to Covid-19 as the China or Wuhan virus, the former president may have made Asians and Asian Americans the target of violence, as well as bigotry and xenophobia. Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University, told USA Today, “When President Trump began and insisted on using the term ‘China virus,’ we saw that hate speech really led to hate violence.” He added, “That sort of political rhetoric and that sort of anti-Asian climate has continued to this day.” Jeung created a tracker to monitor hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI). His website, Stop AAPI Hate, recorded some 2,500 discrimination cases across the United States from March to August 2020. USA Today reported recently that the figure had risen to 2,808 by yearend. Other groups tracking those hate crimes corroborate the trend. The AAPI website said the most common type of discrimination was verbal harassment and name calling, 70.6 percent of the reports. Physical assault, the fourth most common type, represented 8.7 percent of the reported incidents. The victims varied from children to the elderly. The plurality of those reporting the incidents were ethnically Chinese, 40.4 percent and those of Filipino ethnicity, 7.6 percent. The same USA Today story mentioned a Filipino American, 61-year-old Noel Quintana, who suffered facial lacerations after he was attacked on the New York City subway by someone wielding a box cutter. There is worse. Earlier in January, an 84-year-old Thai living in San Francisco died after he was assaulted by someone who earlier shouted, “Go back to China.” Trump trial In fairness to Mr. Trump, he did make at least one public statement appealing for the safety of Asians and Pacific Islanders. But that was obviously too little. Also, it would be wrong to assign all the blame on the former president. Discrimination against Asians in America dates back to when Chinese immigrants were recruited to work on the US railroads. And who can forget the internment of Japanese Americans during World War 2? German Americans and other citizens descended from European countries that fought the United States did not suffer similar persecution. Still, that does not excuse Mr. Trump from stoking hate. He may be on trial for inciting an insurrection, but we hope that the US Senate finds him guilty for symbolic reasons. That may not happen, of course. As local politicians say, impeachment is a numbers game. For now, the Democrats do not seem to have the numbers needed to convict. But we still hope that US senators will vote not based on loyalty to one man but on moral principles and democratic values. As mentioned, perpetrating hate is not among the articles of impeachment. And if even Mr. Trump lost, the majority of the 74 million Americans who voted for him in 2020 still cling to lies, not only about the US elections but also about the pandemic and its economic impact. We recognize that US President Joseph Biden is rolling back many of his predecessor’s policies. By voting guilty, the US Senate reinforces the signal that America can transcend party politics and bring back decency. We hope America heals soon, not only from Covid-19 but also from moral decay."

The country also reported another 758 coronavirus-related deaths. The total number of coronavirus-related deaths in Britain now stands at 116,287. These figures only include the deaths of people who died within 28 days of their first positive test. The latest figures were revealed as Britain’s coronavirus R0 or reproduction number, also known as the R number, has fallen to below one for the first time since July 2020. The figure is now between 0.7 and 0.9, down from between 0.7 and 1.0 last week, according to the British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The R number represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above one, an outbreak can grow exponentially, but when it is below one it means the epidemic is shrinking. Meanwhile, Britain is stepping up efforts to speed up vaccine roll-out to bring the pandemic under control. More than 14 million people in Britain have been given the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest official figures. Britain aims to complete the vaccination of the top priority groups, which cover 15 million people, by mid-February. Downing Street has confirmed that all British adults aged 50 and older are expected to be offered a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine by early May. Britain aims to offer all adults their first dose by autumn. England is currently under the third national lockdown since the outbreak of the pandemic in the country. Similar restriction measures are also in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. To bring life back to normal, countries such as Britain, China, Germany, Russia and the United States have been racing against time to roll out coronavirus vaccines."

Neither of us could do what we do without the other. Unicef’s success is WHO’s success, and we are proud to be your partner on so many issues: Ebola, polio, maternal health, nutrition, infection prevention and control, primary healthcare — the list is long. Never has our partnership been more important than it is now. The Covid-19 pandemic has changed our world in ways we could never have imagined when it started just over a year ago. It’s sobering to think that on this day 12 months ago, more than 3,000 new cases of Covid-19 were reported to WHO. Yesterday (Feb. 10, 2021), 3,000 cases were reported every 15 minutes. The pandemic has held a mirror up to our world. It has shown humanity at its best and worst. It has exposed and exploited the fault lines, inequalities, injustices and contradictions of our world, within and between countries. The pandemic has also become a child emergency, with children bearing both its direct and indirect consequences. Children suffer
Children may be at lower risk of severe disease and death from Covid-19, but they have suffered many of the most severe social and economic consequences and will bear a large burden of the long-term fallout. Many children have missed out on months of schooling and have been exposed to a greater risk of violence. Girls are especially at risk in places where they may never go back to school, as they approach the age when they will go to work or be married. Since the beginning, Unicef has been, and will continue to be, an indispensable partner in ensuring that children are a primary consideration in the global response to Covid-19. Together, we have engaged, empowered and communicated with communities about the risks of Covid-19 and how to stay safe. We have developed joint guidance for the prevention and control of Covid-19 in schools; We’ve supported health workers with improved infection prevention and control, and we’ve supported them to deliver better care and psycho-social support for patients, their families and communities; we’ve procured and delivered essential supplies; We’ve provided the joint analytics that are key to an effective pandemic response; we’ve supported countries to maintain essential health services, including in humanitarian settings; And through the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator and Covax, we are poised for the largest vaccination campaign in history. Vaccines are the shot in the arm we all need, literally and metaphorically. But we must also remember that vaccines will complement, not replace, the proven public health measures that countries around the world have used successfully to prevent and contain widespread transmission. As governments, institutions and individuals, we all have a role to play in stopping this pandemic with the tools we have. The pandemic will subside, but the inequalities that preceded it will still be there. Respond, recover, rebuild
There’s no vaccine for climate change, poverty or malnutrition. None of these challenges can be met by a single agency. Let me outline three areas in which the partnership between WHO and Unicef, bilaterally and through the Global Action Plan on Health and Well-Being for All, must become even deeper and stronger as we work together to support countries to respond, recover and rebuild. First, as we support countries to respond to the pandemic, we must ensure that all people and communities enjoy equitable access to life-saving vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics — rich and poor, urban and rural, citizen and refugee. A year ago, we were defenseless against this virus. Now we can detect it with rapid diagnostic tests, we can treat it with dexamethasone and oxygen, and we can prevent it with vaccines. The urgency, ambition and resources with which vaccines have been developed must be matched by the same urgency, ambition and resources to distribute them fairly. Unicef has played a vital role in procuring vaccines and preparing countries to deploy them rapidly once they receive them. Together, we have supported 124 countries to perform readiness assessments for vaccination. But we face significant challenges. More than 130 million doses of vaccine have now been deployed globally, but 75 percent of them have been in only 10 countries that account for 60 percent of global GDP. Meanwhile, almost 130 countries, with 2.5 billion people, have yet to administer a single dose. Many of these countries are also struggling to secure the resources for testing, personal protective equipment, oxygen and medicines. I have issued a call to action to ensure that by World Health Day on April 7, vaccination of health workers is under way in all countries. Unicef can play a key role in meeting that challenge. As a trusted advocate, you can use your voice and experience in communities to build acceptance of vaccines; You can deploy your unparalleled logistics and supply capacities to deliver vaccines to the last mile. You can negotiate the best deals for the communities you serve. And you can mobilize your networks of national committees to resource this historic effort to save lives and livelihoods. Second, as we support countries to recover from the pandemic, we must support them to maintain essential health services, including routine immunization for children. The pandemic has shown that we can only meet the major crises of our time with a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach. In the same way, the challenges of child development can only be met with a multi-sectoral approach that addresses their access to services, their mental health and well-being, their nutrition, their risk factors for developing NCDs later in life, their educational outcomes, their chances on employment, and their need to be protected from violence. And third, as we support countries to rebuild from the pandemic, we must invest in primary health care. The pandemic has given us a brutal reminder of the importance of primary health care, as the eyes and ears of every health system, and the foundation of universal health coverage. Ultimately, our fight is not against a single virus. Our fight is against the inequalities that leave children in some countries exposed to deadly diseases that are easily prevented in others. Our fight is against the inequalities that mean women and their babies die during childbirth in some countries because of complications that are easily prevented in others. And our fight is to ensure that health is no longer a commodity or a luxury item, but a fundamental human right, and the foundation of the safer, fairer and more sustainable world we all want. History will not judge us solely by how we ended the Covid-19 pandemic, but what we learned, what we changed, and the future we left our children.

Dr. Alethea de Guzman of the department’s Epidemiology Bureau said based on the overall caseload, the national Covid-19 growth rate has dropped a bit and the healthcare utilization rate for all regions is in the safe zone. The number of severe and critical cases has also gone down, from 8 to 9 percent a few months ago to just 5 percent this month. De Guzman said there was a minor surge in the middle of January because of increased mobility and crowd gatherings during the holiday season. The DoH said while that the two-week growth rate and the average daily attack rate have gone down in the past few weeks, three regions — Cagayan Valley, Central Visayas, Soccsksargen (South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani, and General Santos City) and Caraga — posted positive growth rates in the past weeks, placing them under moderate risk. In Cagayan Valley, the increase was observed in Cagayan and Isabela provinces and Santiago City. In Central Visayas, Cebu province, including the cities of Cebu, Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue, are experiencing a steep rise in cases. Caraga, Agusan del Norte and Dinagat Island were the only areas with a dropping number of cases. Other priority areas flagged by the DoH are Naga City, Mountain Province, Kalinga, Baguio City, Compostela Valley, Tacloban City, Davao City, Benguet, Makati City, Ifugao, Davao del Norte, Lanao del Sur and Bataan. “Kahit na maliit na numero ito, fina-flag na namin (Even if the number of cases are small, we are flagging this) because spikes in cases can start very small, we do not want them to reach high numbers again,” de Guzman said. The number of Covid-19 deaths rose slightly to 2.11 percent due to the continuing harmonization of data together with the Philippine Statistics Authority, de Guzman said. Meanwhile, Dr. Guido David of the Octa Research Group has warned that if the uptrend in Cebu City continues, the city’s hospital bed capacity will exceed the current 850 beds, with occupancy reaching up to 1,200 by March 1. The country logged 1,734 Covid cases on Thursday, for a total of 543,282 cases. The DoH also said it has traced the lone case of the new Covid-19 variant who listed Liloan, Cebu, as his hometown, in Quezon City, where he is now isolated. The Quezon City government said the 35-year-old male moved to Sucat, Parañaque City and made frequent visits to his manning agency in Malate, Manila. His last visit was on
January 14 after he secured another overseas placement. While waiting for deployment, the man rode a cab and stayed in a hotel in Manila on January 17, where he took a swab test. His results returned positive the same day and his sample was sent to the Philippine Genome Center until January 21, when his agency booked a ride-hailing cab and transferred him to an apartment in Riverside in Commonwealth, Quezon City. The genome sequencing results released on February 5 showed that he was positive for the B117 variant. Three days later, he developed a mild cough. De Guzman said the patient, a former overseas Filipino worker, traveled from Cebu to Manila to process his papers. He added that because of the patient’s mobility, the case investigation now involves several cities where he made his contacts."

Octa Research said Covid-19 cases have spiked in Cebu City since February 1, and if the trend would continue, its hospital capacity would reach critical levels in two weeks. From February 1 to 7, the city averaged 123 new cases per day, 30 percent higher than the 94 cases recorded from January 25 to 31. Its positivity rate also increased to 10 percent and its attack rate to 11.11 per 100,000 population. Neighboring Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu cities also saw spikes, with positivity rates above 10 percent. The group warned that the hospital occupancy in the province might reach 70 percent in two weeks if the current transmission rate of R0 (R-naught) 1.4 and a hospitalization rate of 25 to 35 percent holds. Octa said the increase in the number of cases in the city may be attributed to the presence of the more infectious B117 variant, which was detected in Liloan, Cebu. The Department of Health (DoH) acknowledged that there was an increase in the number of cases in the city but said the spike might not be because of the spread of the new variant that originated in the United Kingdom. “Hindi ho natin masasabi na variant lang ang cause. [Maaring] naka aggravate or makasama sya sa (We can’t say that this variant is the cause. There could be other things that have aggravated it or there were other) factors but it is not the only cause of the numbers increasing in Cebu. Marami pa pong factors ‘yan (There are many factors),” Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said. She said other factors such as gatherings held during the holidays and delays in consultation, wherein some people take three to five days to consult doctors for symptoms after they got exposed to a close Covid-19 contact, could also be behind the spike. Vergeire said the One Hospital Command in Cebu City is managing the situation to prevent a possible surge in hospital care capacity. Octa said the National Capital Region continues to see a flattening trend in the number of Covid-19 cases despite having an R0 of1.02 and an average of 360 new cases per day. Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon) and Central Luzon had decreased their positivity rate to 5 and 4 percent, respectively, while Davao’s case numbers were also decreasing. Meanwhile, the DoH sought the help of the National Bureau of Investigation to locate a patient with the B117 variant who listed Liloan, Cebu as his hometown to determine his date of exit and see if he had indeed left the country. It is also set to sequence more than 700 samples from the National Capital Region, Calabarzon, Cordillera and Central Visayas to see if there were more cases of the new variant. Vergeire earlier said that the vaccines from the Covax Facility, which consists of the first batch of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer and BioNTech tozinameran vaccine, might arrive on February 13. It will only take two to three days upon arrival for the vaccines to be administered to frontliners in health facilities. The Health Technology Assessment Council gave its approval for the use of tozinameran and AstraZeneca’s AZD1222 vaccines. In its assessment reports released on Feb. 2 and 8, 2021, respectively, the council said both vaccines passed its appraisals. On Wednesday, the DoH logged 1,345 new cases of Covid-19, for a total of 541,560 total cases, of which 30,188 are active. Priority The DoH also said it was open to the proposal of Sen. Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go to include national athletes in the vaccine priority list. Go urged the government to vaccinate national athletes who would compete in international sporting competitions this year such as the Olympics and the Southeast Asian Games. Vergeire said the DoH was open to the idea, but it has to consult with the interim National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (Nitag) to see if athletes can be prioritized. “Kung hinain natin ito sa Nitag at binigyan natin ng (If we propose this at the Nitag and we would start the) discussions and they would recommend being included, then we will include them,” Vergeire said.

Besides the unprecedented challenges and risks of developing, testing, procuring, transporting, storing, and administering vaccines within extremely tight time frames to billions of people — everything never been done before — there’s the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 mutations, which have been happening since the virus first spread from Wuhan, Central China, over a year ago, may make it deadlier and harder to stop, even with immunization. Indeed, a new British study now undergoing peer review has calculated a 30-percent greater death risk from the more infectious SARS-CoV-2 variant B117, first detected in the United Kingdom last September and found in at least 70 countries, including the Philippines, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) in late January. This greater fatality risk could be as high as 35 percent. That means if past coronavirus strains killed 1,000 people a day, the new one could snuff out 1,350 lives, according to the study by the Center for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.01.21250959v1). The CMMID researchers estimated “that the hazard of death among SGTF [or B117] cases is 30 percent … higher than among non-SGTF cases after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation level, care home residence, local authority of residence and date of test.” And taking account of misclassification of UK-variant patients, the estimated fatality risk would be 35 percent more. What’s worse, there are signs in a small number of UK cases that the British variant may have a mutation first seen in the South African and Brazilian variants, which makes the coronavirus less vulnerable to antibodies produced by people with Covid-19 or vaccination. If confirmed by more data from a wider range of cases, this additional mutation, called E484K, would make B117, which is already more transmissible by as much as 70 percent, also more resistant to immunization. In short, Covid-19 is getting deadlier and harder to stop. Wear masks and find cures
These findings are still being validated by more research. But strategic risk analysis would point to two likely and worrisome trends. First, more infectious variants like B117 will eventually predominate, since it infects more people and spreads faster than the older strains. Moreover, mutations resistant to antibodies would also become prevalent, since more of such strains survive than past ones. Indeed, as immunization spreads, resistant variants would become dominant sooner since the nonresistant ones would die out faster due to vaccinations. These risk factors underscore the imperative that the world continue mask wearing and other prevention protocols and work not only on vaccines but also cures, especially for severe cases that fill hospitals and morgues. The provision of Covid-19 remedies would also consume far less resources than vaccination. For one thing, severe cases requiring medical treatment constitute just a tiny fraction of the population, while vaccination must cover more than half the nation for it to prevent massive deaths. Moreover, a number of remedies have been developed by repurposing existing medications like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, which are often cheap compared with newly developed vaccines. And the side effects of these formulations are already well known, so they can be prescribed with proper safeguards. And if the state expands intensive care units and ventilators nationwide, these facilities would be of use for years and for other illnesses besides Covid-19, unlike vaccines. Hence, in its pandemic responses and budgeting, the government must give as much consideration to medical treatment of the thousands of severe Covid-19 cases as rolling out vaccines for tens of millions of Filipinos, purchased with many billions of dollars in loans which would burden the economy for many years. For this reason, we commend the Department of Science and Technology and its Philippine Council for Health Research and Development for their programs and funding to develop local Covid-19 remedies. One that this writer is involved with is the formulation and testing of a drug combining the anti-inflammatory medicine methylprednisolone and the anesthetic procaine, pushed by Covid cure advocate Ruby Ann Kagaoan and undertaken by the De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute in Dasmariñas, Cavite, and the University of the Philippines College of Pharmacy in Manila. Plainly, with vaccines not only hugely expensive and difficult to deploy, but also unsure of success due to coronavirus mutations, the Philippines must make sure to develop and deploy medication and facilities for severely ill Covid-19 patients, who will continue to be among us, vaccines or no vaccines."

A closely watched visit by World Health Organization (WHO) experts to Wuhan — the Chinese city where the first coronavirus cases were discovered — did not dramatically change the current understanding of the early days of the pandemic, said Peter Ben Embarek, the leader of the WHO mission. But it did “add details to that story,” he said at a news conference as the group wrapped up a four-week visit to the city. And it allowed the joint Chinese-WHO team to further explore the lab leak theory — which former US President Donald Trump and officials from his administration had put forward without evidence — and decide it was unlikely. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is home to many different virus samples, leading to allegations that it may have been the source of the original outbreak, whether on purpose or accidentally. Peter Ben Embarek of the World Health Organization team holds up a chart showing pathways of transmission of the virus during a joint press conference held at the end of the WHO mission in Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province on Tuesday, Feb. 9, 2021. (AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Embarek, a WHO food safety and animal disease expert, said experts now consider the possibility of such a leak so improbable that it will not be suggested as an avenue of future study. But another team member, Danish scientist Thea Koelsen Fischer, told reporters that team members could not rule out the possibility of further investigation and new leads. China had already strongly rejected the possibility of a leak and has promoted other theories. The Chinese and foreign experts considered several ideas for how the disease first ended up in humans, leading to a pandemic that has now killed more than 2.3 million people worldwide. Embarek said the initial findings suggest the most likely pathway the virus followed was from a bat to another animal and then to humans, adding that would require further research. “The findings suggest that the laboratory incidents hypothesis is extremely unlikely to explain the introduction of the virus to the human population,” he said. Liang Wannian, the head of the Chinese side, noted that there was no sample of the virus that causes Covid-19 in the lab — and thus it could not have come from there. The mission was intended to be an initial step in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, which scientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat. Transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, Embarek said. The WHO team’s visit is politically sensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. An AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and ordered scientists not to speak to reporters.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) Still, one member of the WHO team, British-born zoologist Peter Daszak, told The Associated Press last week that they enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested. Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries. The team — which includes experts from 10 countries who arrived on Jan. 14 — visited the Huanan Seafood Market, the site of an early cluster of cases in late 2019. Marion Koopmans, a Dutch virologist on the team, said that some animals at the market were susceptible or suspected to be susceptible to the virus, including rabbits and bamboo rats. And some could be traced to farms or traders in regions that are home to the bats that carry the closest related virus to the one that causes Covid-19. She said the next step would be to look more closely at farms. Liang, the head of the Chinese team, said the virus also appeared to have been spreading in parts of the city other than the market, so it remains possible that the virus originated elsewhere.

(AP Photo/Ng Han Guan) The team found no evidence that the disease was spreading widely any earlier than the initial outbreak in the second half of December 2019. “We haven’t been able to fully do the research, but there is no indication there were clusters before what we saw happen in the later part of December in Wuhan,” Liang said. The visit by the WHO team took months to negotiate. China only agreed to it amid international pressure at the WHO’s World Health Assembly meeting last May, and Beijing has continued to resist calls for a strictly independent investigation. While China has weathered some localized resurgences of infection since getting the outbreak under control last year, life in Wuhan itself has largely returned to normal."

93,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/02/09/news/latest-stories/time-to-wear-a-better-mask-experts-say/838594/,Agence France-Presse,"February 9, 2021","Time to wear a better mask, experts say","WASHINGTON, D.C.: As new, more transmissible variants of the coronavirus spread, experts say it’s time to consider using a medical-grade respirator, or wearing a surgical and cloth mask together. Scientists have agreed for some time the main way the virus is spread is through the air, rather than surfaces, and there’s growing evidence that small droplets from ordinary breathing and speech that can travel many meters (yards) are a common mode of transmission. Added to this is the greater contagiousness of emerging variants, like B.1.1.7, which takes a smaller viral load to cause symptomatic Covid-19 compared to the more common strain. Back when authorities first recommended people wear face coverings, proper masks were in extremely short supply and the public was encouraged to fashion makeshift solutions out of T-shirts or bandanas. But these are far from ideal. Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech, who studies airborne disease transmission, told Agence France-Presse: “How well a mask works depends on two things: filtration and fit. “Good filtration removes as many particles as possible, and a good fit means that there are no leaks around the sides of your mask, where air — and viruses — can leak through,” she said, adding even a small gap could lead to a 50 percent reduction in performance. The best materials for blocking small particles include non-woven polypropylene, which is used to make N95s and many surgical-type masks, and the HEPA filters in planes. Among fabrics, tightly woven cotton works best, she added. This illustration shows a woman wearing two facemasks, a cloth mask over a surgical mask, in Arlington, Virginia, on February 8, 2021. AFP PHOTO “If you wear a cloth mask, choose one that has multiple layers, ideally one with a pocket that you can slip a good filter material into,” said Marr. “Or you can double mask by wearing a surgical-type mask with a tight-fitting cloth mask over it.” Surgical masks are made of material that filters things out well, but they tend to be loose, so adding a cloth mask on top holds down the edges and reduces leaks. Adding an additional layer improves filtration —  if one layer traps 50 percent of all particles, combining two gets to 75 percent. But, she added: “We do not recommend wearing more than two masks. Adding more layers proves diminishing returns and can compromise breathability. It must remain easy to breathe through the layers; otherwise, air is more likely to leak in around the sides of the mask.” Masks that have a metal nose bridge help ensure a snug fit, as do straps that tighten around the head, not just the ears. Braces that improve the fit of surgical masks are now available on the market. “You should feel the mask sucking inward when you breathe in, and if you hold your hands around the sides of the mask, you should not feel any air leaking out when you breathe out,” said Marr. In this file photo taken on January 29, 2021 a woman wearing double protective face masks to prevent the spread of Covid-19 waits at a traffic light in Hanoi, a day after Vietnam recorded its first coronavirus outbreak in almost two months. AFP PHOTO Another option is getting hold of N95s, or their international equivalents such as KN95, FFP2 etc. “They all provide a similar level of filtration, meaning protection of particles going in and out,” Ranu Dhillon, a global health physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dhillon, who has been advocating in favor of better masks since last spring, is frustrated by the lack of clear messaging to the public on the value of better masks. What’s more, “there’s not been a concerted push to really mass produce and mass distribute these higher caliber masks.” Health care workers have their masks professionally fit-tested every year to ensure they’re making the right seal, but Dhillon doesn’t see this as a major obstacle. “To teach people to fit a mask, even if not 100 percent perfectly, but more effectively, is something that’s very doable.” In this file photo taken on December 10, 2020 a man wears a double mask as he visits Times Square in New York. AFP PHOTO The key to conceptualizing the threat is to think of cigarette smoke, said Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland. Ventilation definitely helps, but if you’re between a person who is breathing and an exhaust vent, the virus will still reach you — which makes good masks so crucial, he said. Milton and Dhillon are cautiously optimistic that their pleas could soon become policy under the administration of President Joe Biden, and CNN reported last week the US government was working on the first official mask standards. Prior to the pandemic, Milton and other aerosol scientists studying the flu concluded it too is transmitted from tiny droplets from ordinary speaking and breathing, and that the role of sneezing, coughing and transmission from surfaces was smaller than thought. Their findings stirred controversy at the time, but Covid-19 has renewed interest in the research — meaning masks could be a common sight during tough flu seasons, long after the pandemic has receded.

Kalinga Governor Ferdinand Tubban, Photo from Wikipedia In a Facebook post in the provincial government-maintained site, Tubban, who learned of the result on Monday after taking the real time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, has asked people with whom he had come into contact with in the past week to observe for signs or symptoms of the virus and to consult a health worker. The governor has called on residents to observe minimum health protocols such as washing hands frequently, wearing face mask and face shield and to observe social distancing. It was not immediately known where the governor got the virus. Due to the imposition of the enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) in Tabuk City until February 15, the scholarship renewal of grantees has been postponed indefinitely, according to Mayor Darwin Estranero. The grantees, however, were advised to get their grades and enrollment or assessment form and submit them to the Scholarship Office as soon as schools open after the lockdown. Meanwhile, 116 applications are still pending since May 2020 because the Scholarship Office cannot contact the applicants for an interview due to inactive phone numbers. Uncooperative contacts The municipal health office (MHO) of Lubuagan town in Kalinga is faced with the problem of non-cooperative direct contacts of Covid-19 patients. Mayor Charisma Anne Dickpus urged the public to cooperate in the observance of health protocols and to maintain discipline as a way to combat the spread of Covid-19. Dr. Caroline Agyao, MHO chief, said people who knew they have directly interacted with Covid-19 patients refuse to come forward and cooperate and this has been one of their struggles during contact tracing. “We are begging those that had contact with Covid-19 positive patients to submit themselves. This is also for the protection of the elderly and children who are with them in the same house,” Agyao said. She said some also refuse to reveal their contacts and in one instance resulted in the infection of one of their office staff and that all of them had to be quarantined. “Others even hide and when we conduct random testing in areas identified, we find out that there were those infected with the virus,” Agyao said. Agyao said they welcome the modified enhanced community quarantine (MECQ) status of Lubuagan town because it limits the movement of residents and prohibits them from going in and out of the municipality for non-essential travels. “The extension of the MECQ will also provide them ample time to trace all possible contacts of those who turned positive for Covid-19,” she said. Lubuagan town has recorded a total of 59 cases in the municipality since Nov. 20, 2020 with a total of 36 active cases and 23 recoveries as of February 7."

This emerged during a webinar of the French Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, where these company heads highlighted the vital role of sports and mental health in easing the stress caused by the current working environment, which sees many people still working from home. For Dr. Amal Makhloufi Benchouk, Sanofi Philippines general manager and country chairman, keeping a work-life balance is crucial for a sound body and mind. She said it was important to take care of one’s self, especially since the boundary between the workplace and home had been blurred. According to her, some of the things she does to sustain that balance are setting up specific work times; discouraging meetings during lunch breaks; and dedicating her free time to exercising, learning new skills and her family. She said measures that Sanofi had implemented to ensure the health of its employees included adopting a flexible working scheme, setting a specific time for calls to avoid “Zoom fatigue” and regularly working out to promote physical fitness. The company also launched an employee assistance program that aims to provide workers and their families with services like counselling for both personal and professional situations. “As we go on with our daily lives amid the pandemic and beyond, I would like to prescribe a healthy dose of self-care, which I believe is the best medicine for both our mental and physical health,” Benchouk said. Meanwhile, Decathlon Philippines Chief Executive Officer Hans Iff said sports was important in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. According to him, sports could help release positive hormones that could make one feel happier, relaxed and sensible. Iff also shared a few tips that could help people improve their lifestyle, including creating a routine, keeping some moments to themselves and setting reachable targets. One should learn to listen to one’s body and know one’s limitations, according to him as he emphasized the importance of getting good sleep. For Jones Lang LaSalle Country Head and CCI France Philippines President Cristophe Vicic, the pandemic accelerated his company’s well-being strategy for employees. “The JLL vision is that we want our people to feel supported, engaged and healthy,” Vicic said. According to him, this vision is built on four pillars: mental well-being, physical well-being, financial well-being and inclusion in the workplace. Vicic also attested to his experiences in marathons as having helped him in his career and how he applied the principles of preparing for race in his life and career.

The preliminary findings from Oxford University, a co-developer of the vaccine, could vindicate the British government’s controversial strategy of delaying the second shot for up to 12 weeks so that more people can be quickly given a first dose. Up to now, the recommended time between doses has been four weeks. The research could also bring scientists closer to an answer to one of the big questions about the vaccination drive: Will the vaccines actually curb the spread of the coronavirus? It’s not clear what implications, if any, the findings might have for the two other major vaccines being used in the West, Pfizer’s and Moderna’s. In the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, dismissed the idea of deliberately delaying second shots, saying the US will “go by the science” and data from the clinical trials. The two doses of the Pifzer and Moderna vaccines are supposed to be given three and four weeks apart. Still, the research appears to be good news in the desperate effort to arrest the spread of the virus and also suggests a way to ease vaccine shortages and get shots into more arms more quickly. The makers of all three vaccines have said that their shots proved to be anywhere from 70 percent to 95 percent effective in clinical trials in protecting people from illness caused by the virus. But it was unclear whether the vaccines could also suppress transmission of the virus — that is, whether someone inoculated could still acquire the virus without getting sick and spread it to others. As a result, experts have been saying that even people who have been vaccinated should continue to wear masks and keep their distance from others. AstraZeneca vaccine is ready to be used at a homeless shelter in Romford, east London, Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021. The British health service has started to vaccinate “vulnerable” homeless people. In a study by Oxford University, the AstraZeneca vaccine has been shown to reduce transmission of the virus. AP PHOTO Volunteers in the British study underwent regular nasal swabs to check for the coronavirus, a proxy to try to answer the transmission question. The level of virus-positive swabs — combining volunteers who had asymptomatic infection with those who had symptoms — was 67 percent lower in the vaccinated group, the researchers reported. While not a direct measure, “that’s got to have a really beneficial effect on transmission,” Oxford lead researcher Sarah Gilbert told a meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences Wednesday. The researchers also looked at how likely people who have been vaccinated are to get a symptom-free infection. In one subset of volunteers, there were 16 asymptomatic infections among the vaccinated and 31 in an unvaccinated comparison group. Pfizer and Moderna also are studying the effect of their vaccines on asymptomatic infections. Only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are being used in the United States. Britain is using both AstraZeneca’s and Pfizer’s. AstraZeneca’s has also been authorized by the 27-nation European Union. Pfizer has not endorsed the British government’s decision to lengthen the time between doses. Mene Pangalos, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, said that no patients experienced severe Covid-19 or required hospitalization three weeks after receiving a first dose, and that effectiveness appeared to increase up to 12 weeks after the initial shot. “Our data suggest you want to be as close to the 12 weeks as you can” for the second dose, Pangalos said. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the study “backs the strategy that we’ve taken” to make sure more people have gotten at least one shot. Britain’s decision has been criticized as risky by other European countries. Stephen Evans of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said the study’s suggestion that a single dose protected people for 12 weeks was “useful but not definitive.” Doctor Anil Mehta gives the AstraZeneca vaccine to a homeless person at the homeless accommodation YMCA in Romford, east London, Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2021. AP PHOTO He said that the authors themselves acknowledged their research was not designed to investigate the vaccine’s dosing schedule and that their conclusions were based on statistical modeling, not actual patients tracked over time. “It certainly isn’t very strong evidence, but there is also no indication this is the wrong thing to do,” Evans said of Britain’s strategy. One of the Oxford researchers, Dr. Andrew Pollard, said scientists also believe the AstraZeneca vaccine will continue to offer protection against new variants of Covid-19, though they are still waiting for data on that. Fast-spreading mutant versions have caused alarm around the world. “If we do need to update the vaccines, then it is actually a relatively straightforward process. It only takes a matter of months, rather than the huge efforts that everyone went through last year to get the very large-scale trials run,” Pollard told the BBC. Meanwhile, a UN-backed program to supply Covid-19 vaccines to the neediest people worldwide is gearing up after a troubled start. The Covax Facility announced plans Wednesday for an initial distribution of some 100 million doses by the end of March and more than 200 million more by the end of June to dozens of countries. Nearly all of the doses expected for the first phase are due to come from AstraZeneca and its partner, the Serum Institute of India. The rollout will be contingent on the World Health Organization authorizing the AstraZeneca shot for emergency use, which is expected to happen this month. Some 190 countries and territories are participating in Covax, which has seen rich nations scoop up vaccine supplies, sometimes at premium prices. The pandemic’s worldwide death toll has eclipsed 2.2 million, including about 447,000 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data. New cases per day in the US and the number of Americans in the hospital with Covid-19 have dropped sharply in the past few weeks, but deaths are still running at close to all-time highs at an average of around 3,100 a day. Deaths often lag behind the infection curve, because it can take weeks to sicken and die from Covid-19. As the Super Bowl approaches, Fauci is warning people against inviting others over for Super Bowl parties, urging viewers to “just lay low and cool it” to avoid turning Sunday’s big game into a super spreader event. “You don’t want parties with people that you haven’t had much contact with,” he told NBC’s “Today” show. “You just don’t know if they’re infected.”"

The ticking of the clock subdues the usual lively noises of the room, its hands pointing toward the hour and minute of the time being. Dr. Carmina FuentebellaFACEBOOK PHOTO As the sun descends to rest, the moon reigns over the sky and the world is once again cloaked in darkness. Humanity then escorts itself to sleep after long hours of either finding their purpose in life or simply letting time pass by. In their deep slumber, they encounter a series of events psychologically as their physical body enjoys its rest. Their minds wander off to limitless worlds — terrains that could only be seen through closed eyes. The scenes are classified in two categories: delightful dreams and disastrous nightmares. They spend their whole night in those imaginary worlds, but as people say, there are dreams that come into reality. In today’s time, that ticking seems to be slower because of the 2019 coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Indeed, it is the nightmare that made its way in the everyday life of humans. Thousands of people become infected everyday, and this global health crisis will continue on until a vaccine is released to the public in support of the declining number of positive cases in the country. Even modern heroes of the Thomasian community – teachers and doctors – are not exempted from this experience, as the darkness of the night once engulfed their skies. At the end of the night is a teacher from the University of Santo Tomas Junior High School (UST JHS) who experienced this nightmare, Frederick Caguioa. He is currently serving as a subject teacher in Mathematics for Grade 7 students and currently leads the Citizenship Advancement Training (CAdT) program for Grade 10 students. On July 19, 2020, he first felt the slight fever that was an indication that he might have contracted the disease. He stated that he slept on their sofa to protect his family and felt that his mind was spinning during the night. “So ang reason for that kasi, I usually go out if I needed to buy something sa Mercury Drug. Importante kasi dahil my wife actually gave birth last March lang, saktong ECQ pa so maliit pa ‘yung baby ko talaga. Eh, I usually go there to buy siyempre, ‘yung gatas. Ang naging problem namin is ‘yung anak ko, nag-diarrhea because of the milk, so we had to really change thrice. ‘Yun pala, kailangan talaga lactose-free na,” said Caguioa in an interview with The Aquinian. The next morning, he immediately looked for an institution that immediately released results, but a 24-hour result test costs P13,000. Caguioa said he already took the test despite the hefty price so that there would be peace and certainty. He prayed overnight that the results would be negative, but unfortunately, he tested positive for Covid-19. As a result, he contacted many people, including his cousin who is a doctor and some alumni of UST JHS, for advice on the steps that he must take as he was Covid-positive. For Caguioa, what made the night even darker was the fact that he was not accommodated by the UST Hospital. He felt both sadness and disappointment, and he was really angry because after all the years he spent in training and honing his young Thomasian students, he was turned down by the university itself on one of the most difficult moments of his life. “I even showed my ID. I even explained to them na I’ve been serving the university for quite some time. Ang word nila sa akin is ‘even sir kung maging critical ‘yung condition ninyo, we really cannot accommodate you here.’ So, I went back to the carpark, went back to my car and really prayed. Ano bang gagawin ko, Lord?” he lamented. Because of this, Caguioa had no other choice but to contact his closest friends, including some fellow faculty members. Feeling hopeless, Caguioa did not waste time in finding a place where his condition will be immediately attended to. Fortunately, his family roots had granted him a contact in his local barangay in Valenzuela, which assured his spot in a Covid-19 facility. Upon his stay in the facility, he was again battling with another enemy 一 being apart from his family for days more than the expected average 14-day Covid-19 infection. “The worst feeling is ‘yung hindi ako makabalik sa bahay for the longest time. Kasi to be honest with you, I went positive for 49 days,” Caguioa shared. When asked how Covid-19 negatively impacted him, he said it was the lost time being with his children. In fact, he also shared that his experience was agonizing because he could not see his children. He had set a wireless CCTV just to see and talk to his children while he was in the facility. “I even cried kasi, siyempre, we celebrate ‘yung monthly celebration ng baby namin. Even my birthday kasi I had my birthday on August 16, and I was still quarantined. Talagang wala, wala man lang celebration. Ako lang mag-isa rito. So, ayun talaga, sadness, loneliness, being away from my children and family,” he added. On the other hand, Caguioa stated that despite all the difficulties, his experience made him closer to God. In fact, during his stay in the facility, his companions constantly asked if he was a priest because he frequently prayed and wore a big rosary on his neck. He was taking the time in returning to his old self — specifically the time when he almost entered the seminary during his high school days. In addition, he said that one should be competent enough when caught in such a nightmare because there are seemingly endless challenges. “Kasi ang number one na nakalaban ko inside the facility is not the sickness itself; it’s all here in the mind. Actually, umabot na nang almost one month na mentally challenged ako. I almost went to depression, pero feel ko umabot na ako roon eh. Kasi hindi ko na alam ang gagawin ko,” stated Caguioa. Despite this, he remained steadfast because of the warriors that were praying for him, and he still has a mission to illuminate the terrains of his students. No doubt, Caguioa is a strong man for he was able to overcome a nightmare as murky as contracting the deadly Covid-19. “Have a stronger faith. Believe in the Lord. Siguro, mas mabigat lang ‘yung krus na pinabuhat sa atin, pero in the long run, baka may mas malaking nilalaan si Lord para sa atin. Kaya kailangan pagdaanan muna natin ‘to. I went through a bigger cross, so I can enjoy a bigger salvation,” he answered when asked what message would we like to impart to other Thomasians who are in the same situation as he were. Even heroes who are expected to save the people from all the dangers that the dark hours entail were not exempted from the nightmare Covid-19 has brought. Another Thomasian who was once immersed in this dark dream is Carmina Fuentebella. As a resident doctor in UST, Fuentebella had found herself in a hospital bed, living the nightmare brought by the pandemic. In fact, she even spent her 27th birthday facing the disease but on the receiving end of the care she used to give to her patients. “Sa una talaga, since marami naman akong na-handle na sakit and relatively bata lang kasi ako, hindi ako takot na nagka-Covid ako. ‘Yung mga kabarkada ko or mga co-residents ko, nagkaroon sila pero naka-admit lang sila tapos eventually gumaling din naman sila so nakauwi rin sila na walang problems. So, hindi talaga ako natatakot nung time na ‘yun,” said Fuentebella in an interview with The Aquinian. However, these thoughts were broken down as she laid in her hospital bed, severely suffering from the disease. As a person in a medical field, what she experienced in the span of time that she was in the hospital was beyond what she had ever expected. She couldn’t help but to find herself vulnerable, given that she was once the hero to people like her. It was easy for her to feel helpless by the thought that she was facing this nightmare alone. “Nung na-admit ako, dun ko na-feel na nagde-deteriorate ako nang konti. Nahihirapan ako huminga, tapos ‘yun nga na-intubate ako,” Fuentebella shared. Aside from the pain that she was experiencing, what stood out as the most painful experience was being separated from her family — the very own people who supported and gave her the opportunity to become a medical practitioner. With all these hardships, she found it inevitable to find herself miserable in the middle of the road. “Kasi ang mahirap kasi sa Covid is dealing with isolation. Kasi ikaw lang talaga lalaban mag-isa. Mag-isa ka sa room. May times na hindi ka talaga, wala ka talagang mapuntahan. Ikaw lang. Nakadepende ka kasi sa sarili mo, dun sa chat, and sa lakas ng loob mo na sana ma-overcome mo siya. Mahirap kasi sabihin na ‘kaya mo ‘yan’ kasi nung time talaga na ‘yun, point of giving up ako,” said Fuentebella. Confusion and pain were predominant during the span of staying in the hospital, given that it is inevitable when you are the one isolating because of the disease. With Covid-19, the actual enemy of patients is not only the virus, but also the psychological damage it brings to the patients. The virus lived in her mind, and she could not stop the thoughts about her occupation that kept on eating her alive. “Natakot ako nung una na parang sabi ko ayoko nang magdoktor, kasi honestly naman, as residents hindi ka naman ganun kalaking kumikita compared sa mga, pag nag-consultants na eh. Mapapaisip ka kung is it really worth it na kapag doktor ka, tas ‘pag nagkasakit ka uli, namatay ka, mawawala lahat ng mga dreams mo in the future, yung mga gusto mo pang gawin,” she added. Indeed, Covid-19 caused these individuals to shiver and almost succumb to the cold and detestable night. As they awakened from the darkest of dreams, they may still be recovering, but the strength in their hearts are stronger than ever. When the clock strikes the first hour of dawn, humans welcome yet another day filled with joy, relief, and even sorrow in the presence of the sun. For these heroes who battle in the education front and the receiving end of the pandemic, all the hours, minutes and seconds will be spent whatever the heart must do or what the heart desires, but one thing is for certain — they have proven that with hope and prayer, light will shine even through the most impenetrable darkness."

Comelec spokesman James Jimenez said on Wednesday the poll body was considering temporarily prohibiting  the traditional “face-to-face” campaign in the wake of uncertainties on the start of the implementation of the country’s vaccination program. The poll body, Jimenez added, has sounded the alarm to the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) to discuss the matter. Jimenez said, however, that any changes in the method of campaigning on radio and television would also need a corresponding amendment on related existing elections laws. The start of the campaign period is determined by the Omnibus Election Code (OEC), which is 90 and 45 days for national and local candidates respectively.The OEC also limits campaign spending of candidates. On the other hand, Republic Act (RA) 9006 or the Fair Elections Act regulates the size of printed campaign materials and limits television and radio advertisements. The Comelec noted that with some 80 million Filipinos who need to be vaccinated, the implementation of the vaccination program could last up to 2024. Jimenez said that in the absence of a herd immunity, it would be in the best interest of  all concerned to temporarily ban face-to-face campaigns to control the spread of Covid-19. During the 2019 polls, the Comelec, for the first time in the country’s political history, monitored the social media expenses of candidates and political parties."

A WHO investigative team is in Wuhan, China — where the first cases were discovered in December 2019 — trying to piece together how the virus jumped from animals to humans before going on to kill more than two million people. The UN agency’s emergencies director Michael Ryan hit out at those sniping at the mission, and said people claiming they have information on how the pandemic broke out should emerge from the shadows. Ryan said many critics were saying they “won’t accept the report when it comes out”, or that there is “other intelligence available that may show different findings” on how the virus broke out. “If you have the answers… please let us know,” Ryan told a press conference from the WHO’s headquarters in Geneva. He asked how responsible it was “to say you won’t accept a report before it’s even written? To say that you have intelligence that has not been provided?” The WHO mission comes with heavy political baggage — China refused the team access until mid-January and there are question marks over what the experts can hope to find, one year on. Beijing is keen to put the focus on its recovery from the outbreak. The team toured a propaganda exhibition celebrating China’s recovery from the pandemic in Wuhan on Saturday. Ryan was responding to a question which referenced new US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who earlier Monday told NBC that China was falling “far short of the mark.” “China has to step up and make sure that it is being transparent, that it is providing information and sharing information, that it is giving access to international experts and inspectors,” Blinken said. “Its failure to do that is a real problem.” Ryan said the team in the field deserved international support, and in the meantime, “it’s time for people who say and think they have information to start providing it”. He added that all infectious disease investigations find information that then throws up further questions. “It’s a detective story,” he said. Peter Daszak (r), Vladimir G. Dedkov( l) and other members of the World Health Organization  team investigating the origins of the Covid-19 leave the Hubei Center for animal disease control and prevention in Wuhan, China’s central Hubei province on February 2, 2021. AFP PHOTO The expert team in Wuhan has now started investigations on the ground, notably visiting the Huanan seafood market where one of the first reported clusters of infections emerged, and the hospital where early patients were treated. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19, said the team would be visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Former US president Donald Trump pushed an unsubstantiated theory that the virus escaped from the facility. The team are having “very productive discussions with Chinese counterparts, visiting different hospitals around Wuhan,” Van Kerkhove said. “They had a very good visit to the market, seeing first-hand the stalls and walking through.” Van Kerkhove said they had also met with counterparts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. “They will visit the Institute of Virology. That is being planned,” she added. Meanwhile WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was “encouraging” that the global number of new coronavirus cases had fallen for the third week in a row. “It shows this virus can be controlled, even with the new variants in circulation,” he said. However, “we have been here before,” he warned. “Over the past year, there have been moments in almost all countries when cases declined, and governments opened up too quickly and individuals let down their guard, only for the virus to come roaring back.”"

Valente, TMT","February 2, 2021","‘Just keep faith with us,’ Duterte on corruption allegations vs govt","PRESIDENT Rodrigo Duterte has urged the public to keep their faith in his administration amid allegations of corruption in the government, particularly in the procurement of vaccines against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). In his weekly public address aired over state-run PTV-4 on Monday evening, Duterte guaranteed that there were enough funds to pay for Covid-19 vaccines as he dismissed criticisms over the government’s rollout. He said the country’s “greatest disadvantage” was that it was not as rich as Western countries that have already pre-ordered 80 percent of the global vaccine supply, but assured that doses were forthcoming because “we have funds to pay for the vaccines”. He cited that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank have offered loans to pay for the vaccines that the government will buy. The government’s efforts to procure Covid-19 vaccines were once questioned due to the non-disclosure of actual prices of the vaccine. In Monday’s remarks, Duterte slammed critics claiming corruption in the government’s Covid-19 vaccine procurement anew, urging Filipinos not to believe in their false accusations. “Ang hingiin ko lang sana, patapusin mo lang ninyo lang kami (All I ask of you is for you to let us do our jobs first). If there is a liability in one, there will be a liability in all,” the President said. He told the public not to be “gullible” as to believe “talk about corruption left and right”. “It starts with a big bang and ends with a whimper. Wala naman napakulong ‘yang mga ‘yan (They have not sent anybody to prison),” he added. The President also promised to prove that vaccine procurement and rollout would be done “in accordance with the rule of law.” “I said, you have a choice, maniwala kayo sa kanila o maniwala kayo sa amin. Kung maniwala kayo sa kanila, go ahead (You can believe us or not. If you believe them, go ahead),” Duterte said. “Kung may maiwan na maniwala sa amin (If there will be those who will remain),  just keep faith with us. At the end of the day, you will see that everything has been done in accordance with the rule of law,” he added. The President likewise asked the public to trust that the country’s vaccine czar, Carlito Galvez Jr., would get vaccines for the Philippines. “Just stick with General Galvez. Huwag na kayong — huwag kayong lumipas sa kanya (Don’t overlook him) or ignore him and believe the others,” he said. Duterte also said that vaccine deals would not be final until it has been reviewed by Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd. On Monday, Galvez said the country has secured 106 to 108 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines after he signed five term sheets with manufacturers. READ: PH close to securing 188M doses of Covid-19 vaccines The Philippines hopes to secure some 148 million doses, aside from the 40 million doses that will come from the World Health Organization-led Covax Facility, to inoculate an initial 50 to 70 million Filipinos this year. To date, there are 527,272 Covid-19 cases in the Philippines, 10,807 deaths, and 487,574 recoveries."

According to the poll conducted from November 21 to 25 among 1,500 respondents nationwide, SWS recorded the highest average unemployment rate since it started analyzing these figures, currently sitting at 37.4 percent. The average joblessness rate for 2020 was a 8.6-percentage point increase from the previous record of 28.8 percent in 2012 and the 19.8 percent recorded in 2019, or before the pandemic hit the country. In the latest SWS survey, joblessness was at 27.3 percent of the adult labor force, down by 12 points from the 39.5 percent in September 2020. “The estimated numbers of jobless adults are 12.7 million in November 2020 and 23.7 million in September 2020,” SWS said. “Joblessness was 17.5 percent in December 2019, the last measurement before the Covid-19 crisis began,” the polling firm added. SWS defines labor force as those 18 years and above and presently with a job, including those looking for a job. Adults who are jobless consists of those who voluntarily left their old jobs, are seeking jobs for the first time, or lost their jobs due to economic circumstances beyond their control. SWS estimated 12.7 million jobless adult Filipinos in November 2020, lower than the 23.7 million in September 2020. “The 12-point decline in the national joblessness rate was due to decreases of 33 points in the Visayas, 23 points in Mindanao, two points in Metro Manila, and one point in Balance Luzon,” SWS said. Adult joblessness fell sharply in the Visayas, from a record-high 52.0 percent in September 2020 to 19.1 percent in November 2020. It fell sharply in Mindanao, from 40.0 percent in September 2020 to 17.0 percent in November 2020. Adult joblessness fell slightly in Balance Luzon, from 33.5 percent in September 2020 to 32.7 percent in November 2020. It also fell slightly in Metro Manila, from 39.9 percent in September 2020 to 37.8 percent in November 2020. The fourth quarter 2020 SWS survey, conducted using face-to-face interviews, had sampling error margins of ±2.5 percent for national percentages, ±4 percent for Balance Luzon, and ±6 percent for Metro Manila, the Visayas, and Mindanao."

Gonzales,"February 2, 2021",GOCCs’ P119-B dividends allocated for Covid efforts,"The Department of Finance (DoF) said a total of P119.1 billion or bulk of the P157-billion cash dividends remitted by government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs) in 2020 partly funded the Social Amelioration Program (SAP) to ease the economic impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic on poorest households and vulnerable sectors. In a statement, the DoF’s Corporate Affairs Group (CAG) said the P156.97 billion in dividends remitted last year by 57 GOCCs to the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) was the highest amount ever collected since the implementation of Republic Act (RA) 7656 or the “Dividends Law of 1994.” “This is also more than twice of the P69.17 billion dividend collection in 2019, inclusive of the dividend foregone. Without dividends foregone, cash remittances is P135.08 billion in 2020 and P52.59 billion in 2019,” the CAG headed by Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko said in a report to Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez 3rd. Tionko said that P119.1 billion of the GOCCs’ dividend remittances contributed to the government’s unprogrammed revenues. “These GOCC dividends were primarily utilized  for the Social Amelioration Program, which provided emergency assistance to low-income families to help tide them over during the strict lockdowns imposed earlier last year to curb the spread of Covid-19,” Tionko said. This year, Tionko said the CAG will continue to make sure that GOCCs will comply with ra 7856 and its implementing rules and regulations. She said the CAG was able to secure an agreement with the Governance Commission for GOCCs (GCG) in 2020 for the transfer of the web-based GOCC Debt Recording and Monitoring System (GDRAMS) to the DoF. This reporting system aims to streamline the data reporting process and facilitate the timely encoding and submission of the GOCCs of their debt reports, Tionko said. “GDRAMS will help in the analysis of GOCC debt and better manage the government’s financial exposure and strategy formulation,” Tionko said. She said the DoF will further enhance the GDRAMS and train GOCCs on the use of the system so it could be fully implemented this year."

Dressed in a suit, tie and overcoat — but without a face mask — he is seen walking and talking for around 13 minutes through the National Palace. Lopez Obrador said he was working while in isolation, in particular on efforts to secure more vaccines for Mexico, which has one of the world’s highest Covid-19 death tolls at more than 156,000. The country began a mass immunization program on December 24 but like many nations it is struggling to acquire enough doses. Lopez Obrador said Mexico expected to receive six million doses from various manufacturers in February and 12 million in March, by when it hopes to have given a first shot to all older adults. The left-wing populist, who has a history of heart problems and hypertension, announced Sunday that he was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 but had mild symptoms. He joins other world leaders who have caught the virus, including former US president Donald Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron. The health ministry reported on Wednesday that Lopez Obrador had experienced brief episodes of low-grade fever and a slight headache. The Mexican leader has refused to wear a mask except on rare occasions during the pandemic. He was accused by critics of downplaying the risks of the virus early in the crisis and of being slow to impose a lockdown. Both new coronavirus infections and deaths have set daily records this month, leaving hospitals overwhelmed, particularly in Mexico City, which has been in a state of maximum alert since mid-December."

International arrivals, meanwhile, also dropped by 82.4 percent to 1.3 million compared to the 7.4 million recorded from January to November in 2019. Outstanding Marketing Campaign winner Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila Despite this major setback, the hotel and tourism industry continued to prove their resilience. The stakeholders explored ways to restart and offset the crisis’ impact on their sector. Adapting to survive In a press conference just before the end of 2020, the Hotel Sales and Marketing Association (HSMA) — a premier organization of sales and marketing leaders in the Philippine travel and tourism industry — assessed what the sector had to face the entire 2020 and shared some of the adjustment they adapted to survive. Champions of Resilience Marketing Communications, Chroma Hospitality “It brought out the best in us. There were times that we thought we can’t do it anymore because some of the hotels were closed for two months, we didn’t have a job that’s why my heart goes out to the people that really struggled,” recalled Christine Ann Ibarreta, President of HSMA Board for 2021-2022 and Group Director of Sales and Marketing of Golden Phoenix Hotels. Champion of Resilience Team, Luxent Hotel headed byGeneral Manager Melanie Pagkalinawan “In spite of the troubles we went through, we were together looking for business for each other. If my hotel was not open, I was there to help out other colleagues in the industry. We made our HSMA e-store where our member hotels can sell anything so that they would have a source of income. We also tried to share in terms of bookings,” Ibarreta continued. Ibarreta also recalled how they sealed partnership with Philippine Airlines that entailed them having a hospitality desk at the Terminal 2 of Philippine Airlines. “We were there to volunteer, we provided snacks, coffee to the arriving OFWs and balikbayans. We’re happy to be of service. It’s about bayanihan and the love for our job. I believe that after all of these, they will see that we really helped out each other, there’s love for our job and our dedication,” she added. Outstanding Sales and Marketing Manager winner PioSanchez, Senior Sales Manager of El Nido Resorts According to the organization, they were able to handle the difficult situation by collaborating hand in hand with the government sector. “This is a year of a stronger collaboration. The silver lining this year especially for the hotels in Metro Manila, as you know, is the OFWs and balikbayans. The government partnered with a lot of hotels to become quarantine hotels for Filipinos coming back home,” shared Pearl Maclang, Marco Polo Davao’s Director of Sales & Marketing and HSMA Director for Public Relations. “Without them, a lot of the hotels would have been in trouble and that’s what happened with the hotels outside National Capital Region because of the closure of the airports, stricter quarantine protocols and limited market,” Maclang added. Outstanding Sales and Marketing Associate winnerErika Denice Patajo, Events Executive of Okada Manila Maclang reiterated that a stronger collaboration of HSMA, Tourism Promotions Board and the Department of Tourism, allowed the group to stimulate the market to prepare for 2021. “Because to be honest, there’s nothing much we can do, it’s beyond our control. We must address all these changes that happened in 2020 a lot faster, more creative and resilient,” she continued. Throughout the year, hotels also had to update their operational infrastructure and steadily shift many of their platforms to new-age solutions. “Given we’re in a new situation, we can’t be stuck with the old ideas so we encouraged our hotels and resorts to rethink our business model and to adapt to market conviction so that we will have a better chance to survive 2021 and even succeed,” Ma. Celeste Romualdo, General Manager of The Linden Suites and HSMA’s Director for Membership. Finding solutions to thrive In the hopes of thriving this 2021, HSMA laid down several suggestions that they hope would help the industry. Two of them stood out, aligned rules and regulations for tourists and subsidized swab testing. Champion of Resilience Individual, Elena CecilleDaugdaug of Quest Cebu “The Department of Tourism is pushing the local government units to have a same requirements when it comes to rules and regulations. They should have an alignment meeting because they have different requirements per city,” Rose Libongco, HSMA co-founder and Virtus Awards Chair said. Ibarreta, meanwhile, suggested, “We have to thank Tourism Promotions Board COO Anthonette Velasco-Allones and Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat because I think they’ve subsidized swab testing. For the special rate, it is now only for P1,500. But it will be a boost if tourist won’t have to pay for swab testing anymore.” Virtus Awards 2020 Looking at the bright side, the event also saw the annual Virtus Awards. Indeed, HSMA still found a way to recognize the most creative, productive and proactive hotel sales and marketing professionals who were more than resilient in the face of a pandemic. Outstanding Sales and Marketing Leaders winner EunJoo Bae, Director of Sales-FIT at Conrad Manila The highlight of the prestigious event was the Champions of Resilience Awards, created to recognize the contributions of individuals and institutional team/s in addressing the challenges of the pandemic. The Champions of Resilience Awards are divided into three categories: Individual – which was won by Ma. Elena Cecille Daugdaug, Sales Manager of Quest Hotel and Conference Center Cebu; Team – won by Luxent Hotel under the leadership of Melanie Pagkalinawan, General Manager; and Marketing Communications – won by Chroma Hospitality, as led by Carmela Bocanegra, Vice President for Sales and Marketing.

Throughout the year, hotels also had to update their operational infrastructure and steadily shift many of their platforms to new-age solutions. “Given we’re in a new situation, we can’t be stuck with the old ideas so we encouraged our hotels and resorts to rethink our business model and to adapt to market conviction so that we will have a better chance to survive 2021 and even succeed,” Ma. Celeste Romualdo, General Manager of The Linden Suites and HSMA’s Director for Membership. Finding solutions to thrive In the hopes of thriving this 2021, HSMA laid down several suggestions that they hope would help the industry. Two of them stood out, aligned rules and regulations for tourists and subsidized swab testing. Champion of Resilience Individual, Elena CecilleDaugdaug of Quest Cebu “The Department of Tourism is pushing the local government units to have a same requirements when it comes to rules and regulations. They should have an alignment meeting because they have different requirements per city,” Rose Libongco, HSMA co-founder and Virtus Awards Chair said. Ibarreta, meanwhile, suggested, “We have to thank Tourism Promotions Board COO Anthonette Velasco-Allones and Tourism Secretary Bernadette Romulo-Puyat because I think they’ve subsidized swab testing. For the special rate, it is now only for P1,500. But it will be a boost if tourist won’t have to pay for swab testing anymore.” Virtus Awards 2020 Looking at the bright side, the event also saw the annual Virtus Awards. Indeed, HSMA still found a way to recognize the most creative, productive and proactive hotel sales and marketing professionals who were more than resilient in the face of a pandemic. Outstanding Sales and Marketing Leaders winner EunJoo Bae, Director of Sales-FIT at Conrad Manila The highlight of the prestigious event was the Champions of Resilience Awards, created to recognize the contributions of individuals and institutional team/s in addressing the challenges of the pandemic. The Champions of Resilience Awards are divided into three categories: Individual – which was won by Ma. Elena Cecille Daugdaug, Sales Manager of Quest Hotel and Conference Center Cebu; Team – won by Luxent Hotel under the leadership of Melanie Pagkalinawan, General Manager; and Marketing Communications – won by Chroma Hospitality, as led by Carmela Bocanegra, Vice President for Sales and Marketing. As in previous Virtus Awards, honors were given to the Outstanding Sales and Marketing Associate, which was conferred to Erika Denice Patajo, Events Executive of Okada Manila; and Outstanding Sales and Marketing Manager for Pio Sanchez, Senior Sales Manager of El Nido Resorts. Meanwhile, Outstanding Sales and Marketing Leaders was given to Eun Joo Bae, Director of Sales-FIT at Conrad Manila; and, finally, Outstanding Marketing Campaign, an accolade taken home by Sofitel Philippine Plaza Manila, represented by Dave Pimentel, Director of Marketing and Communications, Margot and for their “Bid to Forever” campaign."

The program holds true to its commitment of bringing optimum nutrition for Filipinos. The department came up with new set of strategic plans that will guide planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the institute’s performance through various programs and projects. The goal is to be at the forefront of food and nutrition researches, innovative technologies and transformative information toward a well-nourished nation. The strategies are designed to synergize and complement each other to achieve the strategic direction in five years. Updated nutrition tools
One of the immediate responses to this five-year strategic plan is the launching of the updated nutrition tools on February 19, 2020. These nutrition tools include the Philippine Food Composition Tables 2019 and the Food Exchange Lists (FEL) for Meal Planning, 4th edition. The development of these nutrition tools is aimed at improving the quality of life of Filipinos. On the same event, the DoST-FNRI also launched nutritious food products for nutritionally at-risk Filipinos. The new food products include the Enhanced Micronutrient Growth Mix (MGM 15), Multi-Nutrient Extruded Rice Kernel (MNERK), Rice-Mongo Blend with Vegetables, Rice-Mongo Curls with Vegetable and Extruded Sweet Potato Fries. The new nutritious food products were adopted for commercialization by the Nutridense Food Manufacturing Corporation of Santa Barbara, Pangasinan, which already markets several FNRI food technologies. Quick responses and studies vs Covid-19
After the announcement of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country, one of the immediate responses of DoST-FNRI is to lend one unit of Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) machine to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) on April 16, 2020 to aid in the testing for Covid-19. The department also steps up response to the pandemic by linking with other government agencies in evaluating the beneficial effects of the virgin coconut oil (VCO) among suspect and probable cases of Covid-19. The DoST-FNRI, as project lead, has collaborated with DoST-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (PCHRD), DoST-Regional Office IV-Calabarzon, Philippine Coconut Authority (PCA) and the local government of Sta. Rosa City, Laguna in conducting this study. On Jan. 28, 2021, DoST-FNRI reported the results of the study on virgin coconut oil (VCO) as dietary supplement among Covid-19 probable and suspect cases. It showed that five of the 29 patients who were served meals with VCO manifested diminishing signs and symptoms as early as the second day, while only one patient served with the same meals, but without VCO showed similar improvement. The study was called “Seeing Beyond Covid-19: The VCO Study – Effects of Virgin Coconut Oil among Suspect and Probable Cases” on December 3, 2020. The VCO Group of patients who were served meals with VCO showed no Covid-19 related symptoms at Day 18, while symptoms persisted in some patients of the Control Group of patients who were served the same meals without VCO until Day 23, DoST Secretary Fortunato dela Peña further stated. Secretary dela Peña added that VCO could be used as an adjunct supplement to probable and suspect Covid-19 cases to help prevent symptoms from becoming severe. However, more studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of VCO as adjunct therapy for Covid-19 patients with other co-morbidities, Secretary dela Peña clarified. Return of nutribun
On July, 29, 2020, the deparment conducted the first ever online soft launching of “Ang Pagbabalik ng Nutribun,” via Zoom. The Enhanced Nutribun has more micronutrients like iron and vitamin A. The texture is softer and weighs 160- 165 grams per piece, which is easier for children to hold and bite. Each serving of Enhanced Nutribun weighing 160-165 grams per piece, has 504 calories, 17.8 grams protein, 6.08 milligrams iron and 244 micrograms vitamin A. The Enhanced Nutribun is one of the DoST-FNRI’s answers to the call of the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD) Memorandum Circular No. 12 Series of 2020, or the Guidelines in the Implementation of the Supplementary Feeding Program During Community Quarantine or Other Similar Emergencies. Dr. Mario Capanzana, DoST-FNRI director, encouraged existing and prospective partners to once again support this noble initiative to help ease the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic crisis on the nutritional well-being of our future generation. In his message of support, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Alexei Nograles underscored that: “According to the 2018 Fill the Nutrient Gap – Philippine Summary Report of the World Food Programme, 1/3 of Philippine households are not able to afford a diet that meets the nutritional needs.” Cab. Sec. Nograles also said that “With the Covid-19 pandemic, it has made things even more complicated. And with all these challenges brought about by Covid-19, the government must do all that we can by stretching our limited resources. With these challenges, we need to turn to maximizing science and technology to fill these nutrient gaps and better provide Filipino children with a healthy food that they need to survive and to thrive. “The Nutribun is an example of a science-driven solution that government is pursuing to address hunger and malnutrition. The Enhanced Nutribun developed by DOSTFNRI is more delicious, more nutritious, has better texture, made mainly from squash for better taste, and enriched with protein, iron and vitamin A among others,” Nograles further declared. Current nutritional status
The percentage of food insecure households increased significantly from 53.9 percent in 2018 to 64.1 percent in 2019, according to the 2019 Expanded National Nutrition Survey (ENNS), recent study of DoST-FNRI. The DoST-FNRI further reported that food insecure households were higher in rural areas, with male-headed households, poor or lower wealth status, lower educational attainment of household head, those engaged in agriculture and those with no financial assistance from family members working abroad. Overall, there was a slight improvement in the nutritional status among Filipinos in 2019, with a decreasing trend of stunting among children, although not statistically significant, as well as decreasing trend of overweight and obesity across all age groups. There was also an improvement in anemia prevalence with a decrease in prevalence from 2018 to 2019 across all age groups. However, household food insecurity remains high. Likewise, the increasing trend of diabetes among adults and no significant change in lifestyle-related risk factors still need to be addressed. With the worsening Covid-19 pandemic in the country and in the whole world, there is fear that these improvements might revert back. Challenge amid pandemic
Thus, the challenge for policymakers and program implementers is to mitigate hunger and malnutrition amid the pandemic by keeping food supply available and accessible to all households. Other urgent interventions must include promoting sustained breastfeeding among infants, providing appropriate complementary and supplementary food among preschool and school-age children, and reducing lifestyle related risk factors among adolescents, adults and elderly.

The World Health Organization’s Especial Envoy on Covid-19 David Nabarro, says people should expect to see more coronavirus mutations, but at present there is no evidence to suggest vaccinations will become ineffective. He said, “I think we are going to see more variants coming along and we are going to have to be very clever in understanding quickly what these variants mean when it comes to the preventive therapies, particularly vaccination.” Because of these developments, one’s defenses should level up. Below are some of the tips to remain healthy. Minimize physical contact
Stay at home unless you are a frontliner like healthcare worker, uniformed personnel or media worker. Wear mask and face shield when one needs to go out to buy food and necessities. Be sure to follow social distancing guidelines. After returning home, wash hands for 20 seconds, especially after touching surfaces then take a bath immediately. Boost immune system
The second layer of defense is the immune system. According to experts, eating different fruits and vegetables with different colors can boost our immune system. Vitamin A, B12, B9, Vitamin C and D, as well as zinc and minerals enhance the immune system. Fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin A include sweet potatoes, kalabasa, broccoli, carrots, kale, letsugas and pechay. Vitamin D, also known as “vitamin for life” can be achieved from sunbathing under the early morning sun between 8 to 10 a.m. plus eating mushrooms and fish. Red fruits and vegetables are good anti-inflammatory food while orange veggies and fruits are anti-bacterial. Green ones are good for blood vessels like controlling high-blood pressure. Meanwhile, purple ones are good not just for immune system but optimize brain health. Avoid eating processed food and remember food is medicine. Hydrate
Drink lots of water to avoid dehydration. Infuse water with some fruits too. Have a good night sleep. Have an average seven or eight hours of sleep. That’s a reward because it helps in boosting immune system and reduce chances of getting sick. Exercise
Organize a Zumba exercise or yoga or have 15 to 30 minutes of active exercise every day. Stay positive
Yes, it’s still pandemic but worrying will not change the present situation. Stress is a factor that can lower the immune system. So let go of things we cannot change and look at a different perspective. Be positive and influence others to do the same. And most of all, pray to God who is the great healer."

ONE-SHOT DEAL This September 2020 photo provided by Johnson & Johnson shows a clinician preparing to administer investigational Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. Johnson & Johnson’s long-awaited Covid-19 vaccine appears to protect against symptomatic illness with just one shot – not as strong as some two-shot rivals but still potentially helpful for a world in dire need of more doses. Johnson & Johnson said on Jan. 29, 2021 that in the US and seven other countries, the first single-shot vaccine appears 66 percent effective overall at preventing moderate to severe Covid-19. It was more protective against severe symptoms at 85 percent. AP J&J said Friday that in the US and seven other countries, the single-shot vaccine was 66 percent effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness, and much more protective — 85 percent — against the most serious symptoms. There was some geographic variation. The vaccine worked better in the US — 72 percent effective against moderate to severe Covid-19 – compared to 57 percent in South Africa, where it was up against an easier-to-spread mutated virus. “Gambling on one dose was certainly worthwhile,” Dr. Mathai Mammen, global research chief for J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceutical unit, told The Associated Press. With vaccinations off to a rocky start globally, experts had been counting on a one-dose vaccine that would stretch scarce supplies and avoid the logistics nightmare of getting people to return for boosters. But with some other competing vaccines shown to be 95 percent effective after two doses, the question is whether somewhat less protection is an acceptable tradeoff to get more shots in arms quickly. The company said within a week, it will file an application for emergency use in the US, and then abroad. It expects to supply 100 million doses to the US by June, and expects to have some ready to ship as soon as authorities give the green light. These are preliminary findings from a study of 44,000 volunteers that isn’t completed yet. Researchers tracked illnesses starting 28 days after vaccination – about the time when, if participants were getting a two-dose variety instead, they would have needed another shot. After day 28, no one who got vaccinated needed hospitalization or died regardless of whether they were exposed to “regular Covid or these particularly nasty variants,” Mammen said. When the vaccinated did become infected, they had a milder illness. Defeating the scourge that has killed more than 2 million people worldwide will require vaccinating billions, and the shots being rolled out in different countries so far all require two doses a few weeks apart for full protection. Early data is mixed on exactly how well all the different kinds work, but shots made by Pfizer and Moderna appear to be about 95 percent protective after the second dose. But amid shortages, some countries have advised delaying the second dose of certain vaccines with little data on how that would affect protection. All Covid-19 vaccines train the body to recognize the new coronavirus, usually by spotting the spikey protein that coats it. But they’re made in very different ways. J&J’s shot uses a cold virus like a Trojan horse to carry the spike gene into the body, where cells make harmless copies of the protein to prime the immune system in case the real virus comes along. Rival AstraZeneca makes a similar cold virus vaccine that requires two doses. Both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines can be stored in a refrigerator, making them easier to ship and to use in developing countries than the frozen kind made by Pfizer and Moderna. It’s not clear exactly how well the AstraZeneca version, being used in Britain and several other countries, works. Tests in Britain, South Africa and Brazil suggested two doses are about 70 percent effective although there are questions about how much protection older adults get. An ongoing US study may provide more information. J&J said its vaccine works consistently in a broad range of people: A third of participants were over age 60, and more than 40 percent had other illnesses putting them at risk of severe Covid-19, including obesity, diabetes and HIV. J&J said the vaccine is safe, with reactions similar to other Covid-19 shots such as fever that occur when the immune system is revved up. While it released few details, the company said there were no serious allergic reactions. But occasionally other Covid-19 vaccines trigger such reactions, which can be reversed if promptly treated – and authorities have warned people to be on the lookout regardless of which type of vaccine is used. J&J had hedged its bets with a study of a two-dose version of its vaccine which is still underway. Friday’s interim results come on the heels of another vaccine in final testing. Novavax reported this week that its vaccine appears 89 percent effective in a UK study and that it also seems to work — though not as well — against new mutated versions of the virus circulating in Britain and South Africa. A larger study in the US and Mexico is still enrolling volunteers."

He said the IATF’s recommendation would then be presented to Duterte, who would address Filipinos to inform them about the new quarantine rules before the end of the month. “Napakahirap po kasi magsalita kasi talagang nirereserba natin kay Presidente yung desisyon (It’s hard to speak because we are reserving the decision to be announced by the President),” Roque said during an interview with dzMM radio. “Ang importante po sa ganitong punto ay ikumpirma na may mga lugar tayo na magkakaroon ng escalation po from MGCQ, magiging GCQ (What’s important is at this point, we can confirm that there are areas which will have an escalation from MGCQ to GCQ),” he added. Roque said that Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) and Region 11, which were both at “moderate risk” in terms of bed utilization rate, may be placed under stricter quarantine. “May meeting ang IATF today para maresolba ang mga nag-apela.

Gonzales,"January 28, 2021",PH economy contracts by more than 9 percent in 2020,"THE contraction of the Philippine economy eased to 8.3 percent in the fourth quarter last year, bringing the year-to-date decline to 9.5 percent, the lowest recorded since 1946, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) reported on Thursday. In a briefing, National Statistician Claire Dennis Mapa said the contraction in the fourth quarter was a slowdown compared to the 11.4 percent decline in the third quarter of 2020 but a reversal from the 6.7 percent in the same quarter of 2019. The full-year result was also a reversal from the 6.0 percent expansion in 2019. It settled within the -8.5 to -9.5 percent adjusted projection of the government. “Quarantine restrictions and the fall in consumption translates to a total wage loss of around P1.04 trillion pesos in 2020 or an average of P2.8 billion pesos a day. This means that on average, workers lost some P23,000 in income for the year,” the country’s economic team said in a joint statement read by Socioeconomic Planning Acting Secretary Karl Chua. “The year 2020 will be remembered as the most difficult year in our lives,” he added. The agriculture sector contracted by 2.5 percent in 2020 while industry also plunged by 13.1 percent. The services sector also declined by 9.1 percent.

119,https://www.manilatimes.net/2021/01/28/campus-press/catching-fire/833758/,"Ernie Cecilia, DPM","January 28, 2021",Catching FIRe,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIRe), also referred to as Industry 4.0, is creeping into the workplace almost unnoticed. Unbeknownst to many Filipinos, some countries are now adapting to FIRe, and changing their processes to pave the way for the use of massive automation, big data analytics and the Internet of Things. They are also training their workforce to cope with the changing workplace. These countries are now “Catching FIRe”, in a positive way. The countries that ignore the handwriting on the wall about the FIRe will get burned. Covid-19 and jobs Preparation for FIRe seemed to have been sidelined by poorer economies, as Covid-19 took center stage. Some countries were so overwhelmed by the Covid-19 pandemic that they might have never seen FIRe as an emerging constraint. After the longest and harshest Covid-19 lockdown, many Filipinos have realized that work is no longer what it used to be. Work used to be a place you commute to everyday, where you punch your timecard before and after your work schedule, and where you join hundreds or thousands of other employees to produce products or services for specific customers. These days, work is what you do wherever you are, for whoever wants your product or service. Many people think that Covid-19 redefined the concept of work. In reality, it did not. Before the pandemic, many of the changes that we see today in the Philippines were already being done in other countries. As early as five years ago, Americans and Europeans would call a phone number and give the attendant a list of things they want to buy from a grocery store or restaurant and get their groceries or food without having to go out. The Covid-19 pandemic is not a change driver. Technology has driven the major changes in business models and business processes today. The two other major change drivers are 1) the deluge of information that influence government and business leaders in making decisions, and 2) the people themselves — customers who demand more, employees who are more empowered, and citizens who can no longer tolerate the slow undoing of their rights as stakeholders in governance and business. The Covid-19 pandemic is a change accelerator — not a change driver. Pre-Covid, countries already encouraged employees to work from home. Covid-19 practically made work from home (WFH) the default position. Online meetings, webinars, and even online learning in schools and training institutions replaced face-to-face meetings. But the most debilitating effect of the pandemic is the massive closure of hundreds of thousands of Filipino establishments, especially among the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs). As a consequence, millions of Filipinos have lost their jobs. Filipinos wish that the situation would normalize, so that they can get back their jobs. But experts are saying that because of FIRe, some jobs will never be the same. Post-Covid jobs The Financial Times reported, “Industry executives say that the process of technological change is accelerating as a result of the coronavirus. The new innovations include … chatbots, some of which use the same voice recognition technology behind Amazon’s Alexa, and software that can replace repetitive tasks done by humans.” A study of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) revealed that “32 of its member countries noted that the rise of automation and other forms of very advanced technology puts at risk an alarming number of jobs and industries (Nedelkoska & Quintini, 2018). It found that 14 percent of all jobs among OECD countries, equivalent to 66 million workers across 32 countries, have high chances of being automated (at 70% chance of automation). Meanwhile, an additional 32 percent of jobs have a 50- to 70-percent chance of automation, meaning that a significant amount of the tasks involved in those jobs could be automated.” Considering the massive impact of Covid-19 on businesses and jobs, the World Economic Forum (WEF) released a recent 2020 Future of Jobs report. Here are some of the findings: – Before the pandemic, it was opined that the FIRe would render some jobs obsolete, and new jobs will be created. As a consequence of Covid-19, creation of new jobs will not come automatically as a matter of course. – “For those workers set to remain in their roles, the share of core skills that will change in the next five years is 40%, and 50% of all employees will need reskilling.” ¬– The pandemic accelerated the digital transformation of many organizations. The Future of Work for white collar jobs have started, as firms adopted remote working or WFH. – “Roughly 66% of employers surveyed expect to get a return on investment in upskilling and reskilling within one year.” Only 21% of companies surveyed get government support. Upskilling and reskilling To adapt to changes brought about by FIRe, “upskilling and reskilling” of the workforce is highly recommended. Upskilling will help workers cope with changing demands of their current roles. Reskilling will prepare them to qualify for other or newer jobs. According to a 2018 McKinsey study, these job categories will experience a radical shift in skills needs: 1) physical and manual (motor skill-based jobs); 2) basic cognitive (requiring numeracy and literacy); 3) higher cognitive (advanced literacy, decision making, complex information processing, and creativity); 4) social and emotional skills (entrepreneurial, extensive interpersonal and communication skills, and teaching); and 5) technological skills (science-based and higher-level IT skills). McKinsey recognizes the need for physical and manual skills in the future but suggested that workers in this category must have a certain level of digital skills. In the December 1-3, 2020 Arangkada forum of the Joint Foreign Chambers of the Philippines (JFC), Kaushik Das, senior partner and managing partner of Southeast Asia McKinsey & Co., estimated that 19.3 million Filipino employees will likely be displaced in the next few years due to the effects of automation, artificial intelligence and robotics, unless government seriously implements “reskilling and upskilling for new technologies.” Hard and soft skills Hard skills are capabilities required to perform jobs in one’s area of specialization. They are often referred to as technical or technological skills. These skills are vulnerable to technological changes. Soft skills are as important as hard skills. These skills are more “general” and needed across a wide array of job categories. Soft skills are also referred to as “transversal” skills, or skills that can be improved through lifelong learning. In the 1980s, several gurus have identified the 21st century soft skills needed for career success — critical thinking, communication, collaboration and creativity/innovation. Ben Marr of Forbes (2019) identified the soft skills required during the FIRe regime. He cited the 21st century skills and added a few more — emotional intelligence (EQ), analytical ability, decision-making, interpersonal skills, and quick adaptiveness. Dr. Marion Steel of Deakin University emphasized that harnessing soft skills helps keep work “human centric”, as we prepare to work with machines and artificial intelligence. “Leadership” is an important skill of a manager of the future, as the manager needs to effectively work with both people and “thinking machines” that report to him. It is not far-fetched that the rank and file will be supervised by a “robo-boss” that reports to a human manager. Cross-sectoral digital skills will be needed to allow people to traverse careers, for instance, from information technology to information management, to artificial intelligence. The immensity of the change that FIRe could bring will need serious preparation. Organizations must plan to upskill and reskill their people. Governments must help the upskilling and reskilling of displaced employees. When the smoke clears, and the workplace is more Covid-free, many employees will be surprised to find that their old jobs no longer exist. They must possess new skills sets to qualify for jobs in the next normal. There is still no substitute for preparedness, although serendipity and luck can help. But, quite often, I was lucky whenever I was prepared.
