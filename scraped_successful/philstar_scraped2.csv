Officials now expect the first batch of Pfizer jabs, which will consist of 117,000 doses, to arrive within the second quarter.Related StoriesPhilippines signs indemnity agreement with COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers""We have done everything that we have to do. We have signed all the documents that were given to us. It's just a matter of waiting for Pfizer to deliver the vaccine. Let's just wait,"" Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles told radio station dzBB.Nograles, also the co-chairman of the government's pandemic task force, said the administration is negotiating with different parties for the vaccine procurement given the supply limitations. He noted that the government has also secured vaccines manufactured by Chinese drug maker Sinovac and British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca. The government will also negotiate with the Serum Institute of India for the procurement of Novavax jabs and additional AstraZeneca shots.""What is good about our vaccine roll-out plan is we are not dependent on just one brand. We understood early on that there are supply concerns worldwide,"" Nograles said.""We are not just dependent on western countries. We are also looking at Asian countries,"" he added.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. previously said the bulk of Pfizer vaccines may not arrive in the Philippines anytime soon because of high demand.Nograles thanked Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez for his efforts to secure vaccines, noting that Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have committed to allocate supplies to the Philippines.""These two brands are included in the seven brands we are looking at. More brands may be added...We have a good mix because we have western and Asian brands. As the whole world is scrambling for supplies, we have talked to some parties,"" the Cabinet secretary said in Filipino.  A total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac jabs and 487,200 doses of AstraZeneca shots were turned over to the Philippines last week. Another 38,400 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines that were acquired through the COVAX facility were expected to arrive last night.Nograles assured the public that the vaccine priority list would be followed during the roll-out of the AstraZeneca shots. He said the inclusion of non-medical personnel during the start of the vaccination program, including some high-ranking officials, was just a ""miscommunication.""We're really sticking to the priority list. We have a good set-up and we have the NITAG (National Immunization Technical Advisory Group)... and they recommend to the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases) who should be prioritized. Whatever the NITAG recommends, we stick to it,"" he said.""I don't want to preempt the results of the investigation but like I said before... based on the preliminary assessment, it seems that there was a (miscommunication) but there was no intention to jump the line but we're sticking to that queue,"" he added.Under the government's priority list, medical frontliners should be the first to be immunized, followed by senior citizens, frontline personnel in essential sectors, indigent population, other government workers, other essential workers, socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigenous people, overseas Filipino workers, other remaining work force, and the rest of the Filipino population."

""We remain committed to making our vaccine available on every continent to help end this global pandemic.”Taken in two doses, Moderna has reported a 94% efficacy rate for its candidate vaccine. It was approved for emergency use by US regulators in late 2020 and was the jab that America's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci received in December of last year.Apart from the agreed 13 million doses, officials said a separate deal for another 7 million is also anticipated, bringing the total allocation to 20 million as said by Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez Saturday.The development marks a crucial step in the country's vaccination efforts and in turn, on government's bid to inoculate 50 to 70 million this year alone.A supply deal, however, is still different from a purchase agreement. Last month, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said government has signed supply deals with five manufacturers that he did not name.But nothing on procurement has been made final to date, and the jabs that the Philippines have received so far are donations such as Beijing's Sinovac and the Astrazeneca doses from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility."

But it potentially also is a moment where we lose concentration,” WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference.“I really am very concerned that... we think we’re through this. We’re not.“And countries are going to lurch back into third and fourth surges if we’re not careful.“We should not waste the hope that vaccines bring... by dropping our guard in other areas.”WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus praised the first full week of the COVAX roll-out, but said wealthy countries were nonetheless still leaving others behind in the vaccination rush.Within Africa, Angola, the DR Congo, The Gambia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan and Uganda have now received their first doses through COVAX.Elsewhere, Cambodia, Colombia, India, Moldova, the Philippines and South Korea have also taken deliveries.“In the next week, COVAX will deliver 14.4 million doses to a further 31 countries. That brings the total number of countries to 51,” said Tedros.“This is encouraging progress, but the volume of doses being distributed through COVAX is still relatively small.”He said the first round of allocations, running until the end of May, only covered between two and three percent of the population in recipient states, “even as other countries make rapid progress towards vaccinating their entire population within the next few months.”He called for vaccine production to be urgently ramped up, including through linking manufacturers with rival companies that have spare capacity.Tedros also said the planet would be feeling the mental scars from the pandemic for years to come and said the scale of its impact would be worse than during the recovery from World War II.“The whole world is affected. Each and every individual. That means mass trauma which is beyond proportion. Even bigger than what the world experienced after the Second World War,” he said.“And when there is mass trauma it affects communities for many years to come. Countries have to see it as such and prepare for that. Mass, mass trauma.”Brazil fearsMeanwhile Tedros voiced alarm about the coronavirus situation in Brazil, where cases and deaths have shot up, bucking the global trend.He said that in the week beginning Nov. 2, there were 114,000 new cases in Brazil – a figure that hit 374,000 in the week of Feb. 22.Tedros said the number of deaths had also shot up from 2,500 to 8,000 over the same time period.“The situation is very serious and we’re very concerned, and the public health measures that Brazil takes should be aggressive while also rolling out vaccines,” he said. “Brazil has to take this very, very seriously.”He said that because Brazil bordered so many other countries, the situation there threatened the entire South American continent.Ryan said the P1 variant – which has now been found in 29 countries – had become dominant in Brazil, adding to its woes.He said basic public health measures were still the “best bet” in trying to control case numbers.“Our risk, to an extent, is still in our hands,” Ryan said.But he added that it was very hard in countries like Brazil with large urban populations to take measures like physical distancing and mask-wearing “where they don’t have the resources to do that without the support of the state.”"

is encouraging its teachers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 once the vaccine is available to them, especially with DepEd preparing for the possibility of limited face-to-face classes in the coming months.While medical experts have pushed for every Filipino to get vaccinated, Dr. Marilyn Andales, DepEd Cebu Province School Division Superintendent, said the best that DepEd can do is encourage teachers as respect to their individual rights.""Dili man sila pugson... encouraged lang kay naa man pod nay right,"" Andales said.She said teachers in the province have mixed reactions about the vaccine and there are those who are hesitant to get vaccinated.""Naa pud, natural feelings labi na naa kay existing nga mga sakit… kuan sila, apprehensive what might be the effect kung naa, unya naa ko ani nga sakit… Pero naa po’y isog naa pod uban ganahan,"" Andales told reporters at the sidelines of the Enhanced Countryside Development (ECD) program launched by the Cebu Provincial Government in Pinamunganan town, on March 5.With the national government looking at easing more restrictions as the vaccination program rolls out, Andales said they have identified 12 public schools in different local government units where limited face-to-face classes may be piloted.The list, though, is still being finalized, as there are schools that have backed out after their LGU recorded cases recently.""Sa ilang place sauna, wala to sila, COVID-free, but because nisulat sila nga increasing ilahang COVID cases, so ni-decline sila to be a pilot school sa limited face to face,"" Andales

initially deliver 525,600 doses to the Philippines as part of its commitment to give the country a total of 4.5 million doses of the shot by May.Malacañang announced initially that all 525,600 doses would arrive on March 1, only for this to be delayed to March 4 due to supply and logistical problems, which resulted in only 487,200 doses landing in the country.Speaking to health workers at the Ospital ng Parañaque, Galvez said all 525,600 doses did not arrive at the same time because a commercial plane was used for its delivery.The Philippines expects to receive up to 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine this year through the COVAX facility, which ensures that developing countries get access to the coveted drug.The doses from the COVAX facility is on top of the 17 million procured by the national government, local governments and the private sector, which are expected to arrive later this year.AstraZeneca’s shot, which has secured emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration, is found to be 70 percent effective on average and only need to be stored at standard fridge temperatures of 2°C.A member of the private research firm OCTA warned, however, that the shot’s efficacy could decrease to just 10 percent against the new coronavirus variant first identified in South Africa — 58 cases of which have already been detected in the Philippines.The health department sought to soothe those fears, saying that the studies cited only used a small sample of individuals, although it did say that the variant from South Africa, known as B.1.351, “may have an impact on vaccine efficacy.”The World Health Organization (WHO) stands by the use of AstraZeneca vaccine after a preliminary study suggested the jab offered less protection against B.1.351.ModernaAside from the AstraZeneca vaccine, about 20 million doses from US biotechnology company Moderna are expected by the end of May or early June, Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez said Saturday.The Moderna vaccine has, so far, shown a 94 percent efficacy, higher than either that of Sinovac or AstraZeneca which arrived in the past week.At a Laging Handa briefing, Romualdez said the Philippines is also likely to get 117,000 doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine from the COVAX Facility, initiated by WHO.American company Johnson and Johnson has also allocated six million of its COVID-19 vaccine to the Philippines, he added.Overall, the Philippines is expected to receive over 40 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines from the US and the United Kingdom this year,

We are going in circles. This is the only thing that will stop the cycle of COVID.”When they first made a survey on who were willing to get inoculated with CoronaVac, QCGH director Josephine Sabando said only three out of over 1,000 personnel answered in the affirmative.Most of the hospital employees were willing to wait for other vaccine brands, Sabando said.Mayor Joy Belmonte admitted that she was initially dismayed when she heard that only a handful were willing to receive the vaccine developed by Sinovac, which was granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration.Belmonte lauded Sabando for convincing more medical personnel to get vaccinated with Sinovac.Sabando said 300 doses of Sinovac received by Quezon City have been allocated, with more on the waitlist.The hospital director said she organized town hall meetings where she presented data about the efficacy of Coronavac, especially for severe COVID cases.“It prevents mild cases of COVID-19 by 50.4 percent. For moderate, it is 78 percent. But for severe, it is 100 percent similar to AstraZeneca,” Sabando said.“With this vaccine, we are preventing moderate to severe cases among our healthcare workers. Once vaccinated, there will be almost complete protection from hospitalization, intubation, even death,” she added.Sabando underscored the importance of vaccinating health workers as soon as possible, citing the surge in the number of COVID-19 cases in Metro Manila.Belmonte expressed gratitude to the frontline workers who consented to receive the China-made vaccine.“This is a milestone in our COVID-19 response. We have begun the vaccination starting with our health workers,” she said.“I want our doctors and healthcare workers to be protected in any way possible. This vaccine is the best right now considering that this is what is available to us,” she added.The QCGH targets to inoculate 100 people per day."

It is miles away from the vaccination progress in its ASEAN neighbors like Indonesia which has so far rolled out 2.69 million doses, Myanmar with 104,664 doses and Cambodia 33,211 doses.Generally, developing Asia is much behind in vaccination compared to the US and Europe. ADB principal health specialist Eduardo Banzon said a lot of factors can explain the slow progress.“There’s problem on cold chain logistics for the vaccines and this is adult vaccination. Most of the countries are used to childhood vaccination, it’s a little different now,” Banzon said.“It’s a campaign type and shifting to campaign mode for the next six months or so would be challenging. Vaccine hesitance is a problem but not a problem that cannot be solved,” he said.ADB chief economist Yasuyuki Sawada, for his part, emphasized that vaccine rollouts – from procurement to deployment to confirmation of effectiveness – will shape every country’s reopening and recovery this year.“Vaccine roll out is very critical in deciding and reopening of each country,” Sawada said.Meanwhile, presidential spokesman Harry Roque denied insinuation by administration critics that President Duterte was setting the bar low when the latter said the country would achieve normalcy only by 2023. “Well, you know that going back to normalcy is anyone’s guess,” he said.He explained the President’s statement was logical since some experts have said that the country might attain “herd immunity” only a year after a vaccination kickoff.He said if the country completes its vaccination program this year, it will only be by 2022 that herd immunity could be established to signal a return to normalcy.Roque said the government is working doublly hard to restore the public’s faith in the vaccine and the economy.“I don’t think there is a chilling effect on consumption. Why? As the President has said a vaccination program will only have to take off and attract many people for him to decide on opening everything,” he said. – Christina Mendez"

He also thanked the donor countries, which include members of the European Union, a bloc that he had cursed in the past for alleged interference in domestic issues.""I don't know how to express my gratitude to [you],"" he said. ""That you remembered the poor nations is in fact already a plus for humanity..I'd like to say again that we felt the gratitude in our hearts.""""May God bless you for your benevolence,"" he also said.WHO representative in the Philippines Rabindra Abeyasinghe, speaking at the brief ceremony, said that although vaccines have been arriving, preventive measures should not be abandoned. ""Nobody is safe until everyone is safe,"" he also said.The vaccines from the COVAX facility were expected to arrive in February, as the administration sought to give dates that later on turned out to be estimates.AstraZeneca's jabs secured emergency use approval from the Food and Drug Administration in late January after Pfizer did, and was followed by Sinovac.The government's vaccination program started this week with 600,000 doses donated by Beijing, the first to reach the Philippines last week,Taken in two doses, the AstraZeneca vaccine was found to be 70% effective on average. On Wednesday, however, a member of the OCTA Research team warned that its efficacy rate could decrease to just 10% against the new COVID-19 variant first seen in South Africa that has already been detected in the country.But the health department in a briefing earlier Thursday sought to allay such fears, saying the studies cited had a small sample of individuals.It came as South Africa halted the rollout of AstraZeneca after trials there showed a poor showing against combating the said variant. To which, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vegeire said: ""No matter what the publications say that its efficacy has gone lower, until we are not certain, we will continue to use the vaccines.""The arrival marks an important step in the vaccination efforts in the country, as some health workers — first in line to receive the jabs — sought alternatives to Sinovac.Government said too that medical workers above 60 could be prioritized to get Pfizer vaccines, since Sinovac is not recommended for senior citizens.All donations, none boughtCOVAX facility's allocation is different from the direct procurement by government to vaccine manufacturers.The European Union, for one, said it has provided € 2.2 billion to help countries gain access to vaccines, including the Philippines.In a statement, EU's ambassador to the country Luc Véron said the union ""has both a responsibility and interest to make vaccines available for all,"" adding that the union is the ""biggest contributor"" to the COVAX's donation to the country.To date, only term sheets have have been signed, with no purchase deals yet. The supplies from Sinovac and AstraZeneca are also donations.This means that despite officials' repeated pronouncements that the country will have enough supplies this year, the administration has yet to spend the allocated P72.5 billion meant to buy vaccines, funding that is from money borrowed from multilateral sources such as the World Bank."

They were vaccinated with unauthorized and smuggled Sinopharm vaccines in late 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte himself disclosed last December.The innoculation mess drew widespread criticism and calls for accountability, but local regulators said their investigation has hit a ""blank wall"" with no cooperation from the PSG. A similar probe into the use of the same smuggled vaccines by columnist Mon Tulfo, ""Cabinet-level"" officials and a senator are similarly likely to go nowhere.Medical experts warned that failing to hold someone responsible for the unauthorized vaccinations could set a bad precedent for bringing in medicines or other vaccines into the country.They also said that justifying the apparent disregard for the law could undermine vaccination efforts in the country, at a time when public mistrust of the jabs has remained high.Health workers are at the top of government's priority list to get the jabs. But only days into vaccinations, incidents of some officials receiving the jabs despite not being on the list have drawn flak.Later on sought for comment, presidential spokesperson in a briefing admitted ""breaches"" into the vaccination program.""Courtesy of these three incidents, everyone should now know that the first vaccines are only for medical frontliners,"" he said partly in Filipino.

(Sinopharm) has also developed a coronavirus vaccine.Only Sinovac’s CoronaVac has been authorized for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration, while Sinopharm’s jab is still being reviewed by the drug regulator.There have been some fears, particularly from opposition lawmakers, that China is deploying vaccine diplomacy, or using its access to vaccines to force countries to bend to its will.Top government officials have downplayed these concerns, with Malacañang even saying that the donations would not affect the country’s territorial claims in the West Philippine Sea.China considers the West Philippine Sea, or the part of the South China Sea within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, as part of its territory despite a 2016 arbitral ruling that held that its territorial claims in the area have no legal basis.It also passed in January a new law that allows Chinese coast guard to fire at foreign vessels and demolish structures built on contested islands, which prompted the Department of Foreign Affairs to lodge a diplomatic protest and the Armed Forces of the Philippines to increase its naval presence in the West Philippine Sea.During the course of his administration, Duterte has made a remarkable pivot to China, warming up ties with the Asian giant.He has also made clear his preference for Chinese vaccines, especially for the still-unauthorized Sinopharm jabs.Smuggled Sinopharm vaccines were used to inoculate members of Duterte’s security group.

Fernandez, meanwhile, was manning the emergency room at the height of the pandemic.Diaz, who made sure hospital staff were fed and sheltered during lockdown when transportation was very minimal in Metro Manila, said she volunteered to get vaccinated to boost the confidence of hospital employees and health workers.Mayor Francis Zamora, who was at the time quarantined at the CSMC after testing positive for COVID-19 on Monday, said an initial 300 doses were expected to be delivered to the hospital yesterday.“The vaccine rollout comes at a very significant time as almost one year ago, March 6, 2020, the DOH confirmed to me that the first local transmission in the Philippines was a patient from Cardinal Santos Medical Center,” he said in a statement sent to reporters.A 62-year-old man from Cainta, Rizal who had not traveled outside the country tested positive for COVID-19 on March 5 last year and was admitted to CSMC, making him the first recorded case of local transmission. His wife also tested positive for COVID-19, making her the second local case.The pair were transferred to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine for treatment, where they died due to health complications brought by the virus after more than a week of battling the disease.“Now, one year after, our vaccination process has begun, which I believe will be the game changer in our fight against COVID-19,” Zamora added."

The local company also needs to present proof it is the distributor of Sinopharm in the country. Related StoriesFDA says China's Sinopharm applied for emergency use of COVID-19 vaccine“Once they submit the documents, we will begin the evaluation,” Domingo said in a public briefing Wednesday. “Until we see scientific evidence, we see the population involved in their Phase 3 clinical trials, their experience in using the vaccine in other countries, that’s the only time we can give recommendation on the use of the vaccine,” he added.The drug regulator confirmed Tuesday the receipt of an online application seeking emergency use authorization for the jab developed by China’s state-owned pharmaceutical company.Domingo earlier said it may take “around four to six weeks” before the agency can decide on the application because Sinopharm has yet to receive EUA from a stringent regulatory authority or from the World Health Organization. The lack of relevant documents may delay it further.“We’re very objective in approving vaccines. We have a checklist of what we’re looking for: safety, efficacy and quality,” he said.Interim analysis of Phase 3 clinical trials showed that Sinopharm’s COVID-19 vaccine was 79.3% effective in preventing the disease, lower than the reported efficacy rates of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna of 95% and 94.1%, respectively. The data, however, have not been peer-reviewed.So far, only the vaccines of Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac Biotech have obtained EUAs from the FDA. The application of Russia’s Gamaleya for its COVID-19 vaccine remains pending.The jab developed by Sinopharm is the one preferred by President Rodrigo Duterte.It was the same vaccine used by members of the Presidential Security Group, special envoy to China Mon Tulfo, some “Cabinet-level” officials and a senator in an unauthorized vaccine activity last year.The country began its delayed COVID-19 vaccination campaign Monday, with health workers, government officials and uniformed personnel the first in the line to receive donated Sinovac shots."

Essentially, this means that the P72.5 billion that Congress approved for vaccine purchase has yet to be spent.Officials this week sought to explain that the delay in the jabs' arrival was due to supply shortages and logistical concerns.Dr. Rabindra Abeyashinge, the World Health Organization's representative to the country, told CNN Philippines that bottlenecks are hampering the delivery. This includes drugmakers ""unable to meet manufacturing targets, because these are biological processes, and they couldn't proce the quantities that they anticipated they could early on.""""These vaccines need to be transported,"" he said, ""maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world… Now this is causing a challenge.""Apart from the AstraZeneca, some 117,000 doses of Pfizer was also allocated to the country under the COVAX. But vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. bluntly said the country should not expect anytime soon its arrival as the jabs are in high demand in many countries.The arrival of another brand of a COVID-19 vaccine is now more than ever crucial with inoculations already underway with the Chinese-made Sinovac.Significantly, health workers were the first to receive this, despite the Food and Drug Administration earlier advising against administering it to them, after clinical trials in Brazil showed a lower efficacy rate among those dealing with COVID-19 patients.On March 1, the group Alliance of Health Workers in a protest called on government to give medical personnel ""better options for vaccine that have the highest efficacy rate.""""Many from our ranks have been infected and some died in combating the deadly virus,"" said Eleazar Sobinsky, president of the employees' association at the Lung Center of the Philippines.

Ignoring them in the national efforts to contain COVID-19 will result in failure since the health of prisons and the communities surrounding them are linked.”Penal and detention facilities across the country are known to be overcrowded, where social distancing and proper hygiene—practices meant to deter spread of the novel coronavirus—are practically impossible for inmates.SPECIAL REPORT: Beyond arrest, raps: 'Quarantine violators' face trauma, COVID-19 risk tooDespite earlier claims from the government that inmates are ""safer"" from the threat of the coronavirus inside prisons, both the Bureau of Corrections and Bureau of Jail Management and Penology recorded hundreds of COVID-19 cases since the outbreak in March 2020 — this, despite a lockdown enforced in the facilities.The Supreme Court and the Department of Justice meanwhile crafted policies to help decongest the prisons that allowed the release of thousands of inmates."

So whatever the vaccine (brand is), what’s important is we have the freedom to choose which vaccines we want,” she said, stressing that protection against the disease is better than none.Mayor Vico Sotto said Sabarre’s willingness to receive vaccines would help drum up confidence in vaccines.“When we see she’s safe (after receiving the vaccines) and strong as always, the confidence level is expected to rise,” Sotto said.Pasig began vaccinating health workers yesterday with only half of the 300 initially scheduled vaccine recipients opting to get injected. Health workers from Pasig City General Hospital and the Children’s Hospital were reportedly afraid of receiving vaccines.While Sotto said the city would respect their decision to opt out of receiving the Sinovac vaccines, he reiterated his call to trust experts.“When the Department of Health, doctors, Food and Drug Administration and regulatory counterparts in other countries, and experts say a particular vaccine brand is safe and effective, we can be sure that these are indeed safe and effective,” he said.The resistance was also understandable, he added, since more data and trial results have yet to come in.

We are looking at how we can accelerate delivery,” he said in a television interview.The WHO official also underscored that on the global level, they are seeing two bottlenecks for the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccines.First is that pharmaceutical companies could not meet the manufacturing targets for the vaccines.“These are biological processes and they could not produce the quantities they anticipated they could early on,” Abeyasinghe said.The other bottleneck is on the delivery process.“These vaccines need to be transported. Maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world,” Abeyasinghe said.He added that 190 countries have signed up to the COVAX facility, anticipating to receive COVID-19 vaccines.The WHO official said the “consignments are ready and just logistics arrangements are being made.”“So once we have a finalization and a confirmed itinerary of the delivery, we will share that information… I don’t want to create any expectations until we have a firm date,” he added.Sinopharm EUAMeanwhile, Duterte is waiting for the approval of the emergency use application (EUA) of Chinese vaccine maker Sinopharm, Malacañang said yesterday.Duterte is a senior citizen, but he is not expected to be among the first to be inoculated in the government’s vaccination program.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not recommend administering Sinovac vaccines – the first COVID-19 shots to arrive in the country – to health workers and senior citizens despite the approval of its EUA. The China-made vaccine posted only a 50.4-percent efficacy rate among health care workers exposed to the coronavirus.Last Monday, Roque said a Palace legal team is studying whether the 75-year-old Duterte can be vaccinated with jabs manufactured by Sinopharm, which has secured a compassionate use license. The issue, however, has become moot and academic because Sinopharm has already applied for EUA, according to the Palace spokesman.“That question is already moot and academic because the President will be waiting for the EUA because I reported yesterday (March 1) that Sinopharm has applied for EUA. He will just wait for the approval of Sinopharm,” Roque said at a press briefing yesterday.In an interview, FDA director general Eric Domingo said Sinopharm submitted an application online Monday afternoon.“We are looking at the documents now to see if the documents are complete or if there are any documents that need to be submitted before we officially accept the application,” Domingo added.In December last year, the Presidential Security Group (PSG) admitted that some of its members had received COVID-19 shots ahead of the FDA’s approval of the local use of COVID-19 vaccines.PSG chief Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III defended the vaccination, saying Duterte’s security aides need to ensure that they do not pose a threat to the President’s health and safety.Last Sunday, Duterte, who has expressed readiness to be vaccinated in public, said he would heed his doctor’s advice on what COVID-19 shot to get.“We have to be careful. I have my own doctor. She thinks that another brand… I will not mention it, I will just wait for it. She is waiting for it,” the President said at a press conference at Villamor Airbase.“On the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage. It is to my self-interest that I should get one. No doubt about it. As to what brand, that’s the problem because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added.Clinical trialsHealth Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire yesterday said Janssen Pharmaceuticals is conducting clinical trials in the country for its two-dose regiment COVID-19 vaccines.Vergeire added that Janssen is looking at the possibility that the two-dose vial is more efficacious against the coronavirus or will give higher immunity.Aside from Janssen, the FDA had also allowed Sinovac and Clover Biopharmaceuticals to do clinical trials in the Philippines. – Sheila Crisostomo, Alexis Romero"

This should not change even with COVID-19,” Lopez said.He said employees should have an option.“Anyway if an employee is not vaccinated, he or she is the one at risk of getting COVID-19,” Lopez said.The labor group said the government should immediately act to prevent the discriminatory and coercive mandatory vaccination in some workplaces.Based on internal surveys initiated by some companies, the ALU said a large number of working people are reluctant to be vaccinated for fear of adverse or side effects.In Iloilo City, the local government intends to enforce a “no vaccine, no work” policy in public and private offices operating in the city, it said.“This mandatory workplace policy is a form of coercion and discrimination, which violates the right of workers to freely decide and chose for themselves, particularly with regards to their health and well-being,” the group said.ALU vice president Gerard Seno said the group is advocating for the vaccination of all workers and pushing for the prioritization of essential workers to be inoculated with safe and effective vaccines.Seno said the decision of any person not be vaccinated should be respected and employers could only persuade employees with the benefits and advantages of being vaccinated.Sen. Joel Villanueva pressed for the immediate vaccination of workers, saying it is the only way for the economy to recover.Villanueva, chair of the Senate labor committee, said he moved for the inclusion of workers in the vaccination program’s priority lane as he knew that unless workers are given back their jobs, the economy will have a difficult time recovering.“We believe that we will be able to recover only if our workers are protected,” Villanueva said in a radio interview.He cited data showing up to 17 million workers lost their jobs at the height of the enhanced community quarantine from March to April.Millions of families suffered economically due to the pandemic, which hit the country in March 2020, he said.P100 wage hikeMeanwhile, labor group Defend Job Philippines yesterday called for an immediate action on the pending petition for a P100 across-the-board wage increase for workers nationwide.“We hope the labor department and the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) will act immediately on our petition as this is an urgent matter for Filipino workers in the wake of a pandemic,” Defend Jobs spokesman Christian Lloyd Magsoy said.NWPC executive director Criselda Sy gave assurance that the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) is acting on the petition filed by Defend Jobs Philippines.“The petition was filed before the RTWPB-NCR. The board is acting on the petition,” Sy said.Magsoy said prices of commodities and services are steadily going up at this time of pandemic, except for the wages of workers.Based on the group’s oil price monitoring, Magsoy said, the costs of gasoline and diesel increased eight times since January this year.“The series of big-time hikes on the costs of oil and petroleum products was an additional burden to the already loaded shoulders of Filipino workers in the light of the consistent price surges of basic commodities and services in this time of a pandemic,” Magsoy said in a statement.He said the government must immediately do something to stop these unlimited oil price hikes.Aside from intervening in the deregulated status of oil pricing in the country, Magsoy said the government should also prioritize and speed up the implementation of a P100 emergency wage relief.The group filed a formal wage petition before the NCR wage board on Monday."

But one thing is certain – we will achieve herd immunity in due time,” Zuasula said during a forum of the Office of the Presidential Assistant for the Visayas (OPAV).Emotional ArrivalRetired Major General Melquiades Feliciano, Visayas implementer of the Inter-Agency Task Force, had volunteered to be vaccinated on March 4.He described the arrival of the vaccine at the Mactan Cebu International Airport as being emotional.“Oo, medyo naging emotional dahil at long last, dumating. Diba, ito yung pinakahihintay natin? Masaya lang talaga, masaya, hindi lungkot,” Feliciano told The Freeman.His wife, Mia, said on Facebook: “Cried happy tears. Light at the end of the tunnel.”Feliciano said some doses will be given to workers in other government hospitals and, if there will be doses left, barangay health care workers can benefit.He is hoping that vaccines from AstraZenica will finally arrive in the Philippines.Assistant Secretary Jonji Gonzales of OPAV said Cabinet members and key IATF officials, including Galvez, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque will be in Cebu tomorrow, March 4.Business SectorBusinessman Kenneth Cobonpue, chairperson of the Regional Development Council in Central Visayas, said the business sector is very eager for the vaccination.Cobonpue said getting people vaccinated is one of the best ways to revive the economy further, especially in Central Visayas where travel and tourism play a huge role in people’s income.But while the vaccines give a glimmer of hope, Loreche reminded the public to still observe minimum health protocols against COVID-19.China DonationSinovac’s CoronaVac is the third COVID-19 vaccine brand, aside from Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca, granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) by the country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA).At least 600,000 doses of the Coronavac arrived in the Philippines on Sunday, February 28. The vaccines arrived at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City on board a Chinese military plane.President Rodrigo Duterte viewed the crate containing the vaccine doses and inspected the actual vaccine vials before the vaccines were transported in at least six 40-footer trucks to cold chain storage facilities that include the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and the Metropac Logistics in Marikina City.In an earlier report, Sinovac is among three vaccines being considered by Cebu City for its own vaccination program alongside Novavax/Covovax and AstraZenica.Novavax has a pending EUA application.The city is no longer considering Pfizer-BioNtech, the first vaccine to be given an EUA in the country, mainly due to storage concerns. — Caecent No ot-Magsumbol, JMO (FREEMAN)"

That is why yesterday’s session was monumental as we already agreed on a resolution that was authored by Garcia (and) Archival, bringing the letter of intent to Mayor Labella to the pharmaceuticals,” said Vice Mayor Michael Rama, the city’s lead convenor for vaccine rollout.The two vaccine brands which the City Council, the convenor body, and the multi-sectoral group have agreed to enter into an agreement with soon are AstraZenica and Covovax/Novavax.AstraZenica already has an Emergency Use Authorization while Covovax’s application is still under review.Sinovac, while also given nod by the Cebu City government, is no longer an option since it is already under the national government’s vaccination program.“With regard to the Sinovac vaccine, since the national government has already purchased the same, the Cebu City government will wait for the guidelines as to how it should be implemented and distributed to the constituents, mindful (of) the latter’s right to choose which vaccine to receive,” part of the resolution states.Rama reiterated that the council is also open to other vaccine brands, such as Pfizer and Moderna, as long as they have secured an EUA, do not need ultra-cold storage, and the price is reasonable.“We are not limiting it to other vaccines if they get the FDA’s EUA. But we have to consider the costs and storage. It’s going to be a nightmare if it needs ultra-storage,” the vice mayor said.The City Council is expected to finalize the number of vaccines to be purchased before entering into a purchase agreement.The city government initially set aside P400 million for the purchase of vaccines against COVID-19.Meanwhile, the council also had initial discussions on the city’s vaccine priorities as well as vaccination sites, vaccinators, and other personnel needed in its vaccination program.The proposed vaccination drive-thru had also been scrapped after Dr. Ilya Abellanosa of the Cebu City Health Department said individuals that have been vaccinated need to be monitored yet for some time before being allowed to go home.Councilor Alvin Dizon also opened up on the possibility of having a “house-to-house” vaccination for seniors and PWDs which Abellanosa said is already being considered in their initial plan. — with Decemay P.

But he stressed there are bottlenecks hampering the delivery of the doses like manufacturers being ""unable to meet manufacturing targets, because these are biological processes, and they couldn't produce the quantities that they anticipated they could early on.""Logistics already being arrangedHe also identified logistical challenges as another reason for the delay of the shipment.“We’re now anticipating a second bottleneck and that is delivery processes. These vaccines need to be transported, maintaining cold chain requirements and logistic handlers are having challenges in ensuring large shipments of vaccines across the world… Now this is causing a challenge,” Abeyasinghe said.“My understanding is that the consignments are ready and just the logistics arrangements are being made. So once we have a finalization and a confirmed itinerary for delivery, we will share that information,” he added.Asked if the delayed delivery was due to logistical concerns and not a supply problem, Abeyasinghe responded: “Right now, that’s what we’re made to understand.”Vaccine deliveries to the Philippines are being coordinated by the UNICEF, the WHO official also said.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said Monday that there is no definite date yet for the arrival of the AstraZeneca shots but he is hoping the shipment will come before the first quarter ends.Delayed Pfizer shipmentAbeyasinghe said the country’s “access to Pfizer vaccines may be delayed” but he expressed hope that the jabs will come “before the end of the month.”Officials have been saying the supplies of Pfizer shots are in high demand in many countries, with Galvez saying the country should not expect delivery anytime soon.Some 117,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine were expected to arrive by mid-February but the delivery got delayed. Officials attribute the delay due to the absence of an indemnification program.The Philippines finally kicked off its inoculation drive against COVID-19 Monday, with medical workers, government officials and uniformed personnel among the first in line to receive shots of CoronaVac, the vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech.But the vaccination campaign faces not only supply problem but also public reluctance to get the critical shots. — Gaea Katreena Cabico"

""Lahat po sila ay umuwi at wala pong in-admit sa hospital.""(All of them were monitored and managed accordingly.

But she sought to assure that the chances of having adverse effects are only minimal.""Dapat wala tayong ikatakot sa injection...at 'wag matakot magkaroon ng adverse reactions kasi napaka-mild po ng ibibigay na mga reaction nito,"" she said.(We should have nothing to fear for injections, as well as on having adverse reaction because these are only mild.)Government in the recent months up to the first arrival of the vaccines had to struggle with encouraging more Filipinos to receive the jabs, as surveys showed only a few were willing to take it on concerns about safety and efficacy.Some administration officials took the Sinovac in public in a ""symbolic"" vaccination on Monday in a bid to ramp up public confidence on the vaccines. But noticeably, some of those who earlier remarked that they would take the jabs suddenly could no longer take it — such as Health Secretary Francisco Duque III and President Rodrigo Duterte due to old age. — with reports from Gaea Katreena Cabico"

But Domingo told ANC’s Matters of Fact that its probe into the smuggling of COVID-19 vaccines for use of the president’s guards has hit a “blank wall” due to the non-cooperation of PSG personnel.In February, the FDA issued a “compassionate use license” for Duterte’s security detail to take 10,000 Sinopharm jabs. The country finally began its COVID-19 vaccination campaign Monday, with health workers, government officials and uniformed personnel the first in the line to receive donated Sinovac shots."

I’m not sure if they filed online,” FDA chief Eric Domingo said in a text message.So far, the FDA had granted EUA to Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac.Still under evaluation are the applications of Gamaleya-Sputnik of Russia and Bharat Biotech Covaxin.Speaking to reporters at the Villamor Air Base last Sunday, Duterte said he would follow his doctor’s advice on which COVID-19 vaccine to take.“We (people who are in their 70s) have to be careful. I have my own doctor. She thinks that another brand, I will not mention it, I will just wait for it. She is waiting for it,” the President said at his first press conference since COVID-19 was declared a pandemic.“In the matter of getting the vaccine, it is to my advantage. It is to my self-interest that I should get one. No doubt about it. As to what brand, that’s the problem because it is left to the sound discretion of my doctor,” he added.Asked to react to Vice President Leni Robredo’s statement that he should be the first to be inoculated to boost public confidence in the COVID-19 shots, Duterte said: “Siya man ‘yong apurado, siya ang mauna (She’s the one so eager so she should be the first). I cannot just decide. She’s young, I am not.”“Why make a drama out of who should be the first? The problem is my doctor is waiting for something,” he added.Roque said the President would inform the public if he experiences side effects after getting vaccinated.“The President has promised that once he gets inoculated, it (would) be held publicly... Of course, we will inform you about the side effects if any on the President. But since he has not yet received a vaccine, that is moot and academic,” the Palace spokesman said.“Let me clarify. What is stated in the Constitution is the President has the obligation to make public his medical condition only if he has a serious illness,” he added.Duterte said health workers who do not want Sinovac vaccines can wait for the AstraZeneca shots expected within this month.“They have a choice, it’s either... AstraZeneca or Sinovac. If they do not want Sinovac, they have to wait... I was assured that it would be coming within the next few days,” the President said.Duterte stressed there would be no forced vaccination.“Now, for those who do not want to be vaccinated, that’s OK with me. I have no problem. You do not want vaccines? OK, that’s your choice,” he added.Sen. Bong Go said key government officials have asked to be vaccinated first so they could inspire confidence in the vaccines and not because they are priority.“It’s not a question anymore if the President is willing to be vaccinated in public or not because we all want to be vaccinated. We are doing this not because we are the priority. We will do this to show the public that we should trust the vaccine,” Go said.Go also expressed his willingness to be vaccinated in public together with Duterte to demonstrate the vaccines’ safety and efficacy. Go chairs the Senate committee on health and demography.Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said they haven’t received any complaint from military personnel regarding their mandatory COVID-19 vaccination.“It’s not true that many are complaining. If they don’t want Sinovac they will still be vaccinated by other brands. And if there are no free doses available, they will have to pay for them,” he told reporters in English and Filipino.AFP chief of staff Lt. Gen.

I did not feel it when I was being vaccinated,” he said in an interview, adding that a few hours after receiving the vaccine, he still could not feel anything even on the injection site.“Of course I have to monitor myself in the next 24 hours… But (so far), I do not feel soreness and systemic symptoms like fever,” Domingo said.At 52 years and being a health care worker, he noted that he fits the criteria for Sinovac vaccinees.Meanwhile, members of the Alliance of Health Workers at LCP staged a “lunch break” to denounce what they called government’s “consistent inconsistencies” in the vaccination program against COVID-19.The group’s president, Robert Mendoza, said they are “dismayed at the sudden turnaround decision of the government to inoculate health care workers (HCWs) with Sinovac”?as this is “sacrificing the health and safety of the health workers.”He added that the government is “practically forcing HCWs to accept Sinovac vaccines, called CoronaVac.”Eleazar Sobinsky, LCP Employees Association president, said HCWs deserve the best vaccine against the novel virus as their “health and lives are always at stake.”Sobinsky stressed that it would not be enough for the government to simply indemnify health care workers “who will suffer severe side effects or death due to the COVID-19 vaccines.”“We want the government and health authorities to be held accountable in indemnifying victims of severe effects of the vaccine,” he added.Fr. Marlito Ocon, one of the chaplains at PGH, said he preferred to wait for other anti-COVID vaccines to arrive and have options as he expressed his belief that both patients and frontliners should wait for what they deem as the “best vaccine” against the coronavirus.“I’d rather wait for the best one if there are other (brands) that are coming… It is not as if that (Sinovac) is the only vaccine that would arrive in the country or that is the only vaccine available so we have to take the risk for the sake also of the people we serve, our patients and to all frontliners who are here at the hospital,” Ocon told the Catholic church-run Radio Veritas.He revealed that during a meeting with the Department of Health (DOH) at PGH last Sunday, a survey conducted by the hospital that showed 95 percent were against being vaccinated with Sinovac was mentioned.One common reason for this is that they would no longer be able to avail themselves of other vaccines brands if they get inoculated with CoronaVac. – Sheila Crisostomo, Evelyn Macairan"

There is no best vaccine because the best vaccines are those which are effective and efficient and come early,” Galvez stressed.Also among those inoculated yesterday were National Task Force against COVID-19 deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Hospital and Sanitarium (formerly Tala Hospital) in Caloocan City and Metropolitan Manila Development Authority chairman Benhur Abalos at the PGH.Although Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana wanted to be among the first to receive the Sinovac vaccine to build trust and confidence among personnel in the Department of National Defense, he gave in to the advice of doctors who said those above 59 years old should not be inoculated.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, 64, was also not given a jab, but he administered the vaccine to some doctors during a symbolic vaccination at the Lung Center of the Philippines (LCP) in Quezon City.The Department of Health said the secretary “will be vaccinated when the appropriate vaccine becomes available.”In a speech, Duque urged health care workers to allow themselves to be immunized against COVID-19, giving assurance that all vaccines evaluated by the Vaccine Expert Panel and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are safe and effective.“Millions of people have already received donated Sinovac vaccines, not only in China but in 53 other countries. And based on latest data, the ‘adverse event following immunization (AEFI)’ rate is two to five per million doses. It means that’s the only risk for AEFI,” he said.The “benefit versus risk ratio” of getting a jab against COVID-19 shows benefits far outweigh the risks, he added.The Philippines received last Sunday 600,000 doses of vaccines manufactured by the Chinese drug-maker Sinovac, the first COVID-19 jabs to be delivered in the country.A recent survey by OCTA Research indicated that only 19 percent of adult Filipinos are willing to be inoculated against COVID-19 while 46 percent prefer to pass due to safety concerns.Speaking at the ceremonial vaccination of health care workers at PGH, Galvez said getting a COVID-19 shot is a “moral obligation.”“There is no such thing as best vaccine because the best vaccine is the one that is effective and efficient and that which arrive earlier. This is a moral obligation of everyone. All of us should get ourselves vaccinated and let us not wait for what they call the best vaccine,” he said, noting that some vaccines with high efficacy rates would not be available until the third or fourth quarter.The efficacy rate of Sinovac-developed vaccines only stood at 50.4 percent among health workers who were exposed to COVID-19 but officials have maintained it is still effective against the virus. They have also noted that the World Health Organization has set a 50 percent threshold for vaccine efficacy.First in lineThe 59-year-old Dr. Eileen Aniceto – the most senior physician among 19 other pulmonologists at the LCP – was the first to receive a shot of CoronaVac that Duque personally administered.All 20 health workers who have been handling COVID-19 patients at the LCP received their COVID-19 jabs yesterday.“This vaccine, in case you do get COVID-19, will give you a better chance of surviving this infection,” Aniceto told reporters after receiving her jab.Delays on the delivery of vaccines muffled rising public anticipation but the arrival of Sinovac doses wasn’t particularly a cause for excitement either, especially for health care workers on top of the priority list of vaccine recipients.Several health professionals have begged off from receiving CoronaVac in several hospitals in Metro Manila. At the LCP, about 90 percent of all its medical staff have agreed to receive vaccines if these were Pfizer’s.“When we started our preparations for the vaccination, 90 percent agreed when it was Pfizer,” said Dr. Vincent Balanag Jr., LCP’s executive director.Dr. Chette Moje, LCP’s vaccination task force chief, said that as of yesterday only 140 hospital staff members gave their consent to receive CoronaVac. The LCP received 600 doses.Balanag said there are about 1,400 health care workers in LCP.“When we learned it’s Sinovac, of course, we all know the discussions on this one, that’s why we had a town hall meeting the day after we learned it’s Sinovac and we were told that Sinovac has its advantages,” he said.For Dr. Edward Cervales, a fellow at the Department of Pulmonology, it was a personal decision not to wait for Pfizer vaccines that he and thousands of other colleagues in the region were supposed to receive last month.“If ever we wouldn’t get vaccinated with the vaccine we have now, we wouldn’t promote more public trust in the vaccination program and I think it’s about time we move forward,” he said before receiving the jab.“It’s my personal decision to at least set an example also. Because we’ve been treating COVID-19 for almost a year and I think this is somewhat the cure eventually so physicians have to start somewhere, somehow,” he added.Health care workers from COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila were supposed to have received Pfizer vaccines about two weeks ago when the government said the rollout of the first batch of vaccines from the Covax Alliance would arrive, only to be snagged by the lack of an indemnity deal.But Dr. Alfonso Victorino Famaran Jr., medical director of the DJNRMHS or Tala Hospital in Caloocan City, believed that the vaccine he received yesterday would give him the “soonest protection” against the virus even though he would have preferred another brand.“My reason why I chose to inoculate myself with Sinovac is because I will grab the first opportunity to have myself protected against COVID-19,” he said.At the Philippine National Police, PNP General Hospital chief Lt. Col. Cleto Manongas was the first police officer to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, followed by Health Service director Brig. Gen. Luisito Magnaye and PNPGH deputy chief Lt. Col. Raymond Ona.At least 200 PNP personnel from the Health Service were vaccinated yesterday while 600 more in the coming days are expected to be inoculated with Sinovac jabs.PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said no one from the police force has backed out from receiving the China-made vaccines and the police force would be prioritizing personnel assisting in the distribution of vaccines, members of the medical reserve force and others directly dealing with COVID-19 patients.“We are very vulnerable because we are one of the agencies spearheading the security and assisting (in the vaccination program),” he said yesterday, adding that the PNP wants to assist the government in achieving herd immunity.Speaker Lord Allan Velasco will lead the House of Representatives officials to be inoculated when the vaccine allocation for the chamber arrives.“Our election leaders should be at the forefront to be able to show the people that we really need the vaccine and that this is really necessary for us to be able to control and contain the pandemic,” he said. – Michael Punongbayan, Alexis Romero, Jose Rodel Clapano, Ghio Ong, Neil Jayson Servallos, Delon PorcallaRelated video:"

We have one million from Sinovac,” Galvez said.He said there is already a purchase order or PO for the acquisition of one million doses for P700 million.“We have funds. We have P700 million funds,” Galvez pointed out. “Once we sign it, the one million doses will arrive this coming March in tranches. We saw 500,000 doses loaded onto an airplane. So, that would be in two tranches.”Sinovac Biotech general manager Helen Yang told ANC they are still discussing details of the shipment with the Philippine government.“The vaccine showed a good safety profile and strong efficacy results to prevent the severe cases and could lower down the burdens of the health care system,” Yang said.“We sincerely hope that the Philippines will start to use the vaccine and help reboot the economy,” she added.Galvez said the country’s supply agreements with other COVID-19 vaccine brands Moderna, Johnson and Johnson and Novavax were still pending.Aside from Sinovac, other COVID-19 vaccine brands issued emergency use authorization by the Philippine FDA were Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.Galvez also said there is no definite date yet for arrival of 3.5 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccines due to global shortage of vaccines.Based on previous announcement, AstraZeneca vaccines were supposed to arrive yesterday, under the COVAX Facility.“There is no definite date yet. We have seen the reality on the ground. The global shortage of supply is acute,” Galvez said.Galvez also said the first batch of the COVID-19 vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech would likely be delivered by the second quarter. The delivery was initially announced to happen in mid-February.After seeing surveys showing low public confidence in the Sinovac vaccine, the President – Galvez said – ordered him and other top officials to be inoculated with it.At the Philippine General Hospital where he got inoculated with CoronaVac, Galvez said Filipinos would not be able to return to normal life and the economy would remain sluggish if they refuse to get immunized immediately and opt to wait for Western vaccines, which would come later in the year.“We should not wait for the so-called best vaccine. There is no best vaccine because the best vaccines are those which are effective and efficient and come early,” Galvez said.Supply shortageSome 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca’s vaccine from the World Health Organization (WHO)-led COVAX facility were supposed to be delivered yesterday.“We understand the challenge COVAX is facing because they are supplying the global community. What they have said is that the date of arrival is indefinite. Hopefully, by first quarter,” Galvez said, explaining the delay in the delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines.Based on FDA evaluation, AstraZeneca has an efficacy rate of 70 percent after the first dose, a rate that will increase with the second dose after four to 12 weeks.The Philippines has reported 576,352 COVID-19 cases overall, with 12,318 recorded deaths.The government aims to inoculate 70 million of its 108 million people this year to achieve herd immunity and reopen an economy that in 2020 saw its worst contraction on record, due largely to tight restrictions on movement since mid-March.Galvez insisted that the Philippines might not move forward unless everyone is immunized. “It is our moral obligation,” said Galvez.At yesterday’s vaccination kick-off, PGH director Dr. Gerardo Legaspi was the first to be inoculated in public by a nurse, followed by Cabinet and health officials.Manila Mayor Isko Moreno urged the public to trust whatever vaccine is available.“Let’s get vaccinated, let’s save lives every day. We need to move on,” Moreno said, adding he would take his turn after a week.The Department of Health (DOH) said it is looking at two weeks to finish administering the 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines.“We are looking at two weeks for us to be able to roll it out properly and then we will have the next two weeks to monitor if there would still be ‘quick substitution list (QSL)’ that will be used,” DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said.Vergeire noted in a television interview that they want to check the QSL to determine if there are alternative vaccines that have not been utilized.“So basically in two to three weeks, we will be able to utilize this because we already had a plan of rolling it out. Hospitals had been advised already and they are prepared and we started the rollout,” she added.Senators expressed hopes the Duterte administration’s COVID-19 mass vaccination program would not sputter but gain ground faster than the virus could infect Filipinos, who should also be given more vaccine choices.Honoring frontlinersSen. Joel Villanueva said that while 1,000 shots were given yesterday, 100 million more Filipinos need to be inoculated.“The journey of a hundred million shots begins with a single jab. But today’s events shouldn’t be seen as a mere symbolic start but as the start of something sustained, without letup and in numbers increasing by the week,” Villanueva said in a statement.“For that is how we can meaningfully mark the first year of the lockdown on March 15, by demonstrating our will to end COVID’s reign of terror, one injection at a time,” he said.He said a vaccination program done in earnest would also honor health frontliners who, along with the rest of the population, should be provided with more vaccine choices.Senate President Pro Tempore Ralph Recto said the government should match frontliners’ heroism with vaccine offensive or “the first shot in our nation’s counterattack against the virus.”That the first inoculation was given to PGH’s Legaspi “only underscores the moral responsibility of this government to support the continuing heroism of our frontliners with a vaccine offensive.”He called Legaspi the “ground commander of the biggest COVID-19 hospital.”It is also government’s duty to broaden the vaccine source or acquire “the best vaccines, the best human minds had developed,” he said.“The vaccines have arrived as we are letting our people go out of their towns freely. Our vaccine arsenal should then grow as fast as we are allowing people to move around unrestricted. Without vaccines, the virus will be faster and smarter than us,” Recto said.He said the newly signed COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act brings big business to the vaccination drive – not to profit, but to use their massive wealth in vaccinating as many people as fast as possible.“With many sectors now enlisted in vaccine procurement and administration, the national government should lead from the front and not from the rear,” he said.Sen. Grace Poe said the euphoria over the first shipment of the vaccines should be matched with a clear sight on a systematic rollout of the inoculation process.“In making available the vaccine to health workers and other priority sectors, let us not forget our PUV drivers and other workers in the transportation sector who are key to our economic comeback,” Poe said.“Drivers along with the other groups in the priority list – senior citizens, teachers, OFWs, essential staff, frontline workers, indigent population – need the protection against the virus most because of their situation as we embark on the road to the new normal,” Poe said.Sen. Imee Marcos said the government must address immediately the high rate of hesitancy among Filipinos to get themselves vaccinated.“First order of business is to convince Filipinos to get vaccinated. Let’s make the best use of this endless vaccine delay and persuade our people, for their health and the safety of their family and friends, that they should get inoculated as quickly as possible with any FDA-approved vaccine,” Marcos said.“There is so much anxiety about side effects which are apparently rare and minimal – when the danger of infection is real and could be fatal. Any vaccination effort will fail with 46 percent to 47 percent of Filipinos skeptical or even against any COVID vaccines,” she said.“Vaccine hesitancy can complicate the storage and delivery of vaccines, resulting in higher costs or outright wastage,” Marcos explained.“A systematic registration process nationwide for willing vaccine recipients should already be in place if the bulk of vaccines does arrive in the third and fourth quarter of this year. This will guide the logistical requirements for transport, delivery and storage in every LGU from Luzon to Mindanao,” Marcos said.She said “the public is also at a loss on what benefits they are entitled to in case of injury or death. To elicit a more positive response to vaccination, the government must clarify its indemnification policy and how the P500-million budget for this will be spent.” – Sheila Crisostomo, Cecille Suerte Felipe"

She said no doses should be wasted.Dr. Van Baton, DOH-7 regional medical coordinator for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, said that the country targets to vaccinate 70 million of the population for the first year, another 40 million for the second year, and another 12 million for the third year.This is to attain herd immunity, Zuasula said as he appealed to everyone to give the COVID-19 vaccines a chance.Loreche, for her part, said “whatever vaccine is available, we have to use it.”5.6 million CV residentsIn Central Visayas, a total of 5,634,789 people are eligible for COVID-19 vaccination.Loreche did not discuss how these people were identified nor did she provide a breakdown of the number. However, she said that there will be a total of 4,973 vaccination teams that will conduct the vaccination for 14 days.Security in placeMeanwhile, the Cebu City Police Office said security measures for the transport of the vaccines are already “in place” once they arrive here on Mar. 4.""Part sa security plan nga ipatuman sa PRO-7 (Police Regional Office) is ang pag-transport sa time nga maabot siya...

I’m not sure if they filed online… FDA is closed [today] because it’s Araw ng Muntinlupa holiday here in Alabang,” Domingo told Philstar.com.“As far as I know, we have yet to evaluate EUA application from Sinopharm,” he also said in Filipino during a Laging Handa briefing. The FDA chief noted that in case the firm applies for EUA, it may take more than 21 days before the agency can decide on its application. “Maybe a month, around four to six weeks because Sinopharm has yet to receive EUA from a stringent regulatory authority or from WHO,” he said.Last December, Sinopharm said its vaccine was 79.3% effective in preventing COVID-19, lower than the reported efficacy rates of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna of 95% and 94.1%, respectively.Duterte’s choiceThe jab developed by Sinopharm is the vaccine preferred by President Rodrigo Duterte. The 75-year-old chief executive cannot receive Sinovac’s CoronaVac—the only vaccine available in the country at the moment—since his age falls outside the range of 18 to 59 suitable to get the shot. The Sinopharm vaccine was the one used by the Presidential Security Group in an unauthorized inoculation activity last year despite lacking regulatory approval. Special envoy to China Mon Tulfo also revealed last month the he received smuggled Sinopharm shots along with some “Cabinet-level” officials and a senator. He said a friend had smuggled the vaccines into the country. The FDA and the National Bureau of Investigation launched separate investigations into the unauthorized inoculations. In February, the FDA issued a “compassionate use license” for Duterte’s security detail to take 10,000 Sinopharm jabs. The country finally kicked off its COVID-19 vaccination campaign Monday, with health workers and government officials among the first in the line to receive Sinovac shots."

He was the first one to receive an authorized COVID-19 shot in the country.Related StoriesLorenzana admits Sinopharm vaccines used by Duterte’s security detail were smuggledDonated Sinovac doses arrive in the PhilippinesFood and Drug Administration Director General Eric Domingo, testing czar Vince Dizon and Metro Manila Development Authority chair Benjamin Abalos Jr. were also inoculated with the Sinovac vaccine.The rollout came as the country saw the highest number of daily new infections in over four months. More than 576,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported, including over 12,000 deaths.Aside from PGH, it will be administered to health workers at the Lung Center of the Philippines, Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium, Veterans Memorial Medical Center, Philippine National Police General Hospital and Victoriano Luna Medical Center.The 600,000 doses of Sinovac arrived in the country Sunday. These are a donation from the Chinese government. Military personnel are also set to receive 100,000 doses.Last year, members of the Presidential Security Group and several government officials jumped the vaccination line and used smuggled vaccines developed by China’s state-owned pharmaceutical firm Sinopharm in an unauthorized inoculation activity that surprised health authorities.‘Doses of hope’FDA approved the CoronaVac for emergency use a week ago but did not recommend the Chinese-made vaccine to medical frontliners due to a lower efficacy rate reported among the group. It cited results from late-stage trials in Brazil involving health workers exposed to COVID-19 that yielded only a 50.4% efficacy rate.But the health department stressed that the same Brazil study found the vaccine is 100% effective in staving off moderate to severe cases. It was also found to have efficacy rates of 65.3% and 91.25% in trials held in Indonesia and Turkey, respectively.Experts part of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group approved the Sinovac jab to be offered to those willing to take it, reiterating is safe and effective.But many health workers are reluctant and have decided to wait for other vaccines. They were given assurance that they will not lose their spot in the government’s priority list should they refuse to get vaccinated with CoronaVac.Unlike competitor vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, Sinovac has yet to submit critical Phase 3 clinical trial data to medical journals for peer review.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. called the donated Sinovac shots “doses of hope” as he called on Filipinos to get vaccinated against COVID-19.The Philippines is aiming to vaccinate 70 million people this year alone. But due to the shortage of supplies, the “major rollout” will only begin in the third quarter at the earliest. The arrival of around 525,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, distributed through the COVAX facility, was supposed to be on Monday but will be delayed for a week due to “global supply problem.”The government faces the difficult task of conducting a massive inoculation program against COVID-19 following the botched rollout of Dengvaxia. This was highly-politicized despite unfounded claims that the vaccine caused the deaths of children inoculated with it during the previous administration.Recent surveys show that only that almost half of the population are not inclined to get inoculated against COVID-19. The OCTA Research Group survey released last week found only 19% of adult Filipinos are willing to receive COVID-19 vaccines, while a January Pulse Asia survey showed only 32% want to get vaccinated."

Bong Go, who chairs the Senate committee on health. Duterte, however, is still awaiting the advice of his doctors on whether or not it is safe for him to be inoculated with CoronaVac, which officials from the Department of Health (DOH) said is not advisable for health workers and individuals over 59 years old.“(The arrival of vaccines) is just the start. We really need to do more. We need to accelerate the vaccination program in a safe, sure and secure manner,” Go told radio station dzBB yesterday.“(The vaccination) will start with the frontliners, but they have a choice. If they don’t want Sinovac, at least AstraZeneca is there. And when they start getting vaccinated, confidence will follow,” he added, referring to vaccines made by the British-Swedish pharmaceutical giant that is to arrive this week through the COVAX facility of the World Health Organization (WHO).The senator said British Ambassador Daniel Pruce helped in facilitating the arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines.Go added that the issuance of the emergency use authority (EUA) to CoronaVac by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was fast-tracked given the urgent need for vaccines.Simultaneous “symbolic vaccination” will be held in various hospitals in Metro Manila starting at 9 a.m. today.National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr., along with presidential spokesman Harry Roque, FDA director general Eric Domingo, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) chairman Benhur Abalos, Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, and DOH assistant regional director Maria Paz Corrales, is expected to be vaccinated at the University of the Philippines - Philippine General Hospital.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III will be inoculated at the Lung Center of the Philippines. Joining him are MMDA general manager Jojo Garcia, Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte and DOH regional director Corazon Flores.COVID-19 response deputy implementer Vince Dizon, along with Caloocan City Mayor Oscar Malapitan, MMDA chief of staff Michael Salalima and Health Assistant Secretary Elmer Punzalan, will be vaccinated at the Dr. Jose N. Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center and Sanitarium.Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana and DOH director Napoleon Arevalo will lead a similar activity at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center.An hour later, two other ceremonial vaccinations will be held at the Philippine National Police General Hospital, led by Interior Undersecretary Bernardo Florece and PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas, and at V. Luna Medical Center, led by Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff Gen. Cirilito Sobejana and surgeon general Nelson Pecache.Go disclosed that Galvez and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III are expected to visit Serum Institute of India soon to fast-track the procurement of at least a million doses of Novavax.The senator added that Duterte had given instructions that Novavax be distributed to major public hospitals throughout the country, and that the priority list of recipients – frontliners, senior citizens and indigents – be followed.Go said he also had asked Galvez to also prioritize members of media, who are considered frontliners.Meanwhile, Sen. Francis Pangilinan, urged the Health Technology Assessment Council (HTAC) to fast-track its review and recommendation on the use of the China-made vaccines.“Like those in PGH, we want more science-based information on vaccines that will be administered to us. We want the most effective and the safest vaccine for all our fellow Filipinos,” Pangilinan said, as he called on Dr. Marita Reyes of the HTAC to keep true to her promise of not allowing politics to interfere and to make her decision soonest.The senator backed the call of the PGH Physicians’ Association seeking appraisal of CoronaVac “to facilitate individually informed decision-making” before it is administered to the population.Duterte optimistic as Sinovac jabs arriveDuterte yesterday expressed optimism that the Philippines will emerge victorious in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic as he received the first batch of vaccines from China.The President witnessed the arrival of 600,000 Sinovac jabs donated by China at the Villamor Air Base, paving the way for the start of the country’s vaccination program.A China Air Force XIAN Y-20 cargo plane carrying the Sinovac vaccines – some of which will be administered to some Cabinet members and health workers today – landed at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) at 4:08 p.m., according to airport according ramp controllers.Duterte was joined by Duque, Lorenzana, Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro Locsin Jr., Transportation Secretary Arthur Tugade and other government officials in formally receiving the vaccines.Sealed in black container boxes filled with dry ice to maintain their temperature, the vaccines were brought down from the aircraft and loaded onto refrigerated vans.“We welcome this day with high hopes of finally ending the COVID-19 pandemic in our country... I convey my sincere gratitude to the Chinese people and the government of China for this gesture of friendship and solidarity – the hallmark of Philippines-China partnership,” Duterte said in his speech.“With the entire nation’s support, I am confident that we will claim victory over this pandemic,” he added.The Chief Executive thanked government officials and Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian for helping ensure the timely delivery of the donation. Duterte also recognized the sacrifices of medical frontliners and assured them of continuous assistance.“With this very important shipment, I am confident that more batches of vaccines will be available with great dispatch until every Filipino will be given the chance to be vaccinated at the earliest possible opportunity,” he said.“I wish to assure the public that your government remains committed to a timely rollout that will enable us to confidently reopen our society. The delivery of this first batch, I hope, will serve as a guarantee to everyone that we are taking a big step in our efforts to overcome this health crisis,” he added.The first batch of Sinovac vaccines were supposed to arrive on Feb. 23, but it was delayed because the EUA for the jabs was only issued by Philippine regulators last week.Duterte ordered agencies to work together in rolling out the vaccines.“I cannot stress (this) enough: we cannot afford to waste time or resources in the distribution of these vaccines because we are dealing with precious lives,” he said.The President also vouched for the efficacy of CoronaVac as some sectors continue to have apprehensions over China-made jabs.“To my fellow Filipinos, please set your fears aside. These vaccines are backed by science and deliberated on by our experts. I encourage you to get vaccinated at the soonest possible time and be our partner in preventing the further spread of this disease,” he said.Duterte emphasized that those who would have themselves vaccinated should continue to practice health and safety protocols as the country awaits for the final approval of the vaccines. He also reminded the public to wear masks, wash hands and observe physical distancing.“Your cooperation here is key and will undoubtedly save numerous lives along the way,” he said.“Panahon ngayon para mag-bayanihan (It’s time for unity)... Let us all demonstrate unity in our shared task of nation-building and healthier society for every Filipino,” he added.Duterte also announced a plan to make a short visit to China this year to thank Chinese President Xi Jinping for the vaccines.More in pipelineIn a speech, Huang said China certainly considers the Philippines’ need of COVID-19 vaccines as a priority.“Despite the increasing domestic need of vaccines, China has decided to donate vaccines to the Philippines, and more vaccines procured by the Philippine government will surely come soon as expected,” he added.China has rendered vaccine assistance to 53 developing countries and is exporting vaccines to 27 nations, accoding to the ambassador.“Sinovac vaccines have been inoculated in many countries, and (their) safety and efficacy (have) been well-tested,” he said.“As a good friend, neighbor and partner of the Philippines, we sincerely hope that the Philippines control the pandemic to embrace economic recovery and normal life at the earliest date,” he added.‘Biggest immunization drive’With the arrival of Sinovac vaccines, Duque expressed optimism that the country can mount its biggest immunization drive.“This comes at a much-needed time as the Philippines is preparing to face the herculean task of mounting the largest ever immunization program in terms of scale in our history,” he said during the arrival ceremony at the Villamor Air Base.The health secretary thanked the Chinese government for helping the Philippines, from sending medical experts last year to donating test kits among other equipment, and vaccines.He said the Philippines and China can work together in curbing the pandemic and ensuring a healthy future. – Neil Jayson Servallos, Alexis Romero, Rudy Santos, Helen Flores, Romina Cabrera, Evelyn Macairan"

Please trust that this is something that will protect you because we have your best interest in mind,” noted Salvana, who is also the director of the Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology at the University of the Philippines-National Institutes of Health.Salvana made the statement as the country is expecting some 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines to arrive from China today.A COVID-19 survivor, Salvana said that he is willing to take the Sinovac vaccine, as he admitted always fearing for his life.“As for me, I am excited. This is the resolution and we’ve been waiting for over a year and every day when I go out, I’m scared for my life – is this the patient that is going to infect me?” he added.Salvana said he does not want to let go of the chance to be inoculated against COVID-19.“Finally there is something that I can do, very tangible, aside from PPEs (personal protective equipment) and everything. That I know it is the start of the end of this nightmare,” he added.Salvana underscored that they respect if there are health care workers (HCWs) who would refuse Sinovac vaccines, but he reminded them that there is still “no clarity” as to when the next vaccines will come.“This is an emergency, this is a pandemic, there is a clear and present danger to HCWs,” he maintained.Last Friday, DOH-TAG and National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) had approved the use of Sinovac vaccines among HCWs directly handling COVID-19 patients.This is after the Food and Drug Administration had recommended against the inoculation of HCWs with the China-made vaccine because it will have an efficacy rate of only 50.4 in this group.But according to NITAG member Maria Corazon Quizon, the 50.4 percent effective rate is for the prevention of mild infection of COVID-19.Quizon said data show that the vaccine is 70 percent effective against moderate cases and “approaching” 100 percent effective in preventing severe cases of COVID-19“Something got lost in translation. When they said the vaccine efficacy is 50.4 percent in preventing mild infection, they did not complete the sentence that it’s 70 percent effective in preventing moderate cases and approaching 100 percent in preventing severe cases,” she added.She maintained this means that Sinovac vaccines are still able to protect the HCWs.“That is what we want at the end of the day – to prevent the moderate and severe cases,” she said.Quizon pointed out that even after the vaccination program has been rolled out in the country, it is still very important for the health protocols to be strictly observed by the public to prevent the spread of COVID-19.“Just because there are already vaccines, it’s like fiesta already. It’s not like that. We still have to practice due diligence,” she added.Salvana has cautioned against “mixing” different brands of COVID-19 vaccines, saying it could be harmful.“Mixing vaccines might even be harmful… You could have a bad allergic reaction. There’s a lot of things that can go wrong. There is no data on mixing vaccines,” he told ‘The Chiefs.’Salvana noted in some cases, when giving vaccines “too close together, the second dose might not be safe.”He added this is because the immune system of those inoculated “might be prime for other vaccines.”Salvana said those who will be given the first dose of Sinovac vaccines will receive the second dose of the same brand.He maintained they are no longer eligible to get the next vaccines that will arrive in the country, also because of the global shortage of COVID-19 jabs."

Both companies from Korea are WHO pre-qualified vaccine manufacturers.The two Korean firms are traditional vaccine manufacturers that produce vaccines used by the United Nations Children’s Fund.Glovax is in a joint venture with Eubiologics to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine and to build the local next generation COVID vaccine plant.National Policy Against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. endorsed Glovax Biotech to the Department of Science and Technology.The local company is also in talks with the DTI’s National Development Corporation for a possible investment collaboration.The vaccine plant will cost around P7 billion to construct, including technology transfer costs. Glovax said the plant would be capable of providing 40 million doses for domestic use should the government procure them.Glovax Biotech Corp. founder and CEO Giovanni Alingog said Glovax and Eubiologics are in the process of applying for the mergency use authorization (EUA).The EuCorVac-19 of Eubiologics was developed in Western New York by POP Biotechnologies Inc. and has been approved for human clinical trials.The South Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety approved the combined phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials last month.Glovax said that EuCorVac-19 COVID vaccine of Eubiologics was developed in the USA but it will be mass produced at the new facility of Eubiologics in South Korea and will also be manufactured in the Philippine plant.“It is estimated that the world could vaccinate all its population in seven years and the local vaccine plant can help reduce that time frame, especially for the Philippines,” Alingog said.The company said the Glovax proposal to produce the next generation COVID vaccine offers a lot of advantages as it can capture newer COVID strains and other mutations.Other vaccines, the company said, are only 22 percent effective against the new South African strain and other new strains found around the world.The next generation COVID vaccine can be stored up to 25ºC or room temperature up to three months and 2°C to 8°C for longer period.Glovax, the first vaccine company to bring in the first vaccine in 2009/2010 during the AH1N1 swine flu pandemic, said there was also a shortage of the pandemic vaccine at that time.“With this experience, Glovax is proposing a vaccine plant to avert the current and future pandemics,” Alingog said.The vaccine-focused company has been distributing polio, tuberculosis, measles, tetanus, Pentavalent and rabies vaccines and had sold more than 5 million doses of vaccines since 2003."

Bong Go said yesterday.To be inoculated with these vaccines are military personnel, he added.Go said there is also the expected arrival of 520,000 doses of AstraZeneca from the COVAX Facility on Monday, which will give frontliners options on which vaccines they prefer.“Finally, the vaccines will arrive from China. This is what the Chinese government promised to donate to the Philippine government. At first, it was 500,000 doses but they will add 100,000 doses for the military personnel and that’s important because that is the timetable,” said Go in an interview over radio dwIZ.The 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines are good for 300,000 recipients who shall receive two doses each.“Another good news, we are waiting for the vaccine from COVAX. It will come on Monday from AstraZeneca – about 525,600 doses. I talked to (UK) Ambassador Daniel Pruce (and he) promised to help now,” said Go.The supply forms part of the 44 million doses of COVAX to inoculate 20 percent of the population. The vaccines will arrive at 12:15 p.m. on Monday. The government is working to acquire 5.2 million to 9.2 million AstraZeneca dosages from the COVAX facility.“We thank the World Health Organization, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the United Nations Children’s Fund towards this end,” presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said.“We are grateful to everyone – from our medical frontliners to our fellow Filipinos and foreign partners – who stand by us in this challenging time. Together, we will heal and recover as one nation and one people,” he said.Roque also thanked UK Ambassador Pruce for his contribution in speeding up the processes for the vaccines’ arrival in the country.“We would like to thank UK Ambassador Pruce, for it was his intercession that became the reason for the swift arrival of AstraZeneca to the Philippines,” Roque added in Filipino.Go thanked the Chinese and UK governments for the vaccines, and said their arrival took a while as the government tried to ensure the vaccines complied with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards.“They are also looking at its safety data because it is useless if it comes and is not safe. We will prioritize the safety and efficacy of those being brought to the country before we start the rollout,” he said.“Now that vaccines will arrive from China, this is Sinovac and it is important for the public to see that the vaccine rollout is starting,” Go noted.He said President Duterte ordered the rollout to start immediately so the Chief Executive could reevaluate whether to gradually open up or talk again about declaring modified general community quarantine.Duterte inoculationGo maintained that the vaccination of President Duterte will be determined by his doctors considering his health condition.“The President – his doctor will decide what vaccine to use and the doctor is already choosing what is suitable for his age and health. That is the choice. The President will definitely get vaccinated; he will show it to the public,” he noted.Go said he will have his inoculation alongside with the President – not to take advantage of his position, but to encourage the public that getting the vaccine is safe.Simulation exercisesAt a public briefing, Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire noted they have been doing everything to prepare for the vaccine rollout.“Actually, we have been prepared for weeks already because we were expecting the Pfizer vaccines before and now, we are repeating and reviewing our preparations done before,” she added.Vergeire said that part of these preparations was full-scale simulation exercises of the arrival of the vaccines at the airport and delivery to cold chain storage and other logistics last Feb. 9.There were also simulation activities at the hospitals – from how the vaccines will be taken out of their boxes up to inoculating them to recipients, among others.She noted there is now a master list of vaccine recipients and a quick substitution list (QSL) of back-up vaccinees who will step in if an original recipient backs out.The QSL is based on the priortization framework wherein health care workers will be the first ones to be vaccinated against COVID-19.Vergeire added this means that the back-up vaccines will also come from hospitals, “ideally from hospitals near the initial hospitals or the source hospitals where the vaccination is being done.”“We are ensuring that, as much as possible, not a dose of the vaccine will be wasted because we know how important each dose of these vaccines is,” she maintained.Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) says it is “all ready” for the expected arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the country today.During the Laging Handa briefing yesterday morning, MMDA chairman Benhur Abalos said they are ready for the expected arrival of the Sinovac vaccines today.“There was a simulation and the result was good. The distribution and everything that needs to be done are already ironed out,” Abalos said in Filipino.“The vaccine route is ready. We are now ready, along with the police,” he added.Abalos also said they are considering the use of EDSA bus lanes during the delivery of the vaccines from Villamor Air Base in Pasay City.The vaccines are expected to be delivered to several hospitals in different cities in Metro Manila.“We could use the bus carousel. If not, the lanes beside the bus carousel could be used,” he said.Abalos revealed that they would be enforcing the same route for the arrival of the next batches of vaccines.Highest caseAs this developed, the Department of Health’s (DOH) Case Bulletin reported 2,921 new COVID-19 infections yesterday, the highest this year.The cases were documented on Feb.24, bringing the total number of infections to 574,247.Vergeire confirmed there has been an increase in cases in the past days and this can be attributed to “various factors” such as the easing of restrictions.She said there has also been complacency on the part of the public regarding minimum health standards such as wearing of masks and face shields and maintenance of physical distancing.The official also pointed out that the other factor is the “response of the LGUs” to the pandemic.“We have to scale up our response, particularly the quarantine and isolation protocol,” she added.Vergeire maintained that many people are now doing “home quarantine and this might be a cause or a factor” for the rise in cases in the country.DOH data further showed that 42 COVID-19 patients died, raising the death toll to 12,289. On the other hand, 293 cases have recovered, bringing the total recoveries to 524,865.The number of active cases was at 37,093 or 6.5 percent of the over-all cases. – Christina Mendez, Ralph Edwin Villanueva, Sheila Crisostomo"

However, the vaccination plan should have been handled with more prudence and transparency,” PGH doctors said.Vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier teased that coronavirus shots developed by US drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech would be the first to arrive in the Philippines.However, the shipment of these jabs, which the country would get through the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility, were delayed due to the lack of an indemnification agreement."

(It’s) the second step,” HPACC member Antonio Dans said during an interview with “The Chiefs” on One News Wednesday night.Dans said there is no need to seek approval of the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the technical review because the HTAC is mandated by law to evaluate. He explained that the FDA assesses mainly the safety and efficacy of vaccines while the HTAC review goes beyond health concerns.According to HPAAC, foreign donated technology during pandemics and emergencies must still undergo technical appraisal by HTAC in order to determine their clinical and economic value.“Though we welcome this donation and eagerly await other forthcoming donations from the COVAX Facility and from other donor entities as well, we however would still ask our leaders to await the recommendations of the HTAC,” the HPAAC said.Commercial use illegalMeanwhile, a principal author of the newly passed Emergency Vaccine Procurement Act explained that vaccines to be purchased under the measure can’t be used for commercial purposes.“Right now there is an abnormal supply situation, so if private entities will purchase, they can use it only for their employees for now and not sell it,” Quirino Rep. Junie Cua explained.Cua pointed out that centralizing procurement of vaccines through the national government is the most efficient way of acquiring the jabs. And although the measure allows procurement and purchase of vaccines to forgo public bidding during a pandemic, these are still subject to an audit.No blanket immunitySenate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon said the government can’t grant absolute and blanket immunity to vaccine manufacturers because “it is against the law and contrary to public policy.”“Under the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Act Congress passed last Feb. 22, COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers are immune from suits for claims arising out of the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine, but not for willful misconduct or gross negligence,” Drilon said.Drilon explained that any vaccinee can file claims for damages, based on the vaccine manufacturers liabilities arising from willful misconduct and gross negligence.The government recently allotted P500 million to compensate persons who may suffer adverse effects from COVID-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, at a press briefing, Palace spokesman Harry Roque said President Duterte cannot compel columnist and former special envoy to China Ramon Tulfo to cooperate in the investigation about the alleged use of smuggled COVID-19 shots.“As far as Mon Tulfo is concerned, he clarified, he is no longer (a) special envoy to China. He is a private citizen so he can do as he pleases and the President is not in position to compel him to do anything, the President does not have subpoena powers,” Roque said.Roque added that it would be up to the police to look into reports about the unauthorized use of vaccines developed by Chinese firm Sinopharm. – Edu Punay, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Alexis Romero"

A friend in need is a friend indeed,” Ambassador Huang Xilian said,referring to China’s donating the vaccine doses to the Philippines.He expressed hope the arrival of the vaccines from China would kick off the Philippines’ nationwide inoculation program.A Chinese military transport plane will deliver the cargo of CoronaVac doses at the Villamor Air Base, according to a retired Filipino-Chinese official who requested anonymity.Sinovac general manager Helen Yang has confirmed the arrival this week of the vaccines now allowed for local application by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) through an emergency use authorization (EUA).“After we have the EUA issuance, we cleared everything from the approval side and now we need to complete the schedule of delivery and custom procedures that would normally take a few days,” she explained.Yang has also said Sinovac is “in close communication” with the Chinese embassy regarding the delivery of the vaccines.Upon their arrival, the vaccine doses would be loaded onto refrigerated vans – after undergoing customs procedures – and transported to the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City.Despite the confirmation of the date of the vaccines’ arrival, the Department of Health (DOH) and the National Task Force against COVID-19 (NTF) said a vaccine rollout is still being finalized.“Specific details as to the allocation and subsequent rollout of the 600,000 donated Sinovac doses are still being evaluated pending the official recommendation of the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) and its approval by the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF),” a joint DOH-NTF statement read.“Details of the planned arrival ceremony are still currently being finalized in close coordination with the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China,” the NTF said.Yesterday, DOH reported that confirmed COVID cases nationwide jumped to 568,680 with the addition of 2,269 cases.Out of the total cases, DOH said 92.2 percent or 524,042 have survived the infection, including 738 additional recoveries.Active cases stand at 32,437, accounting for 5.7 percent of total cases. The bulk or 94.5 percent of the active cases are mild and asymptomatic.With additional 72 deaths, COVID-related fatalities rose to 12,201. The figure represents 2.15 percent of total cases.Health workers’ turnAnti-COVID task force chief implementer Carlito Galvez Jr. said he hopes the arrival on Sunday of the vaccines would make possible the inoculation of medical frontliners by the first week of March.He confirmed a Chinese military aircraft would deliver the vaccines.Galvez also noted that some mayors, including Manila Mayor Isko Moreno, have volunteered to be vaccinated with Sinovac in public to boost the people’s confidence in the vaccine.Presidential spokesman Harry Roque Jr. said 100,000 of the 600,000 doses scheduled to arrive on Sunday would be administered to soldiers and policemen.It was not clear whether President Duterte would push through with plans to personally welcome the shipment of vaccines at the airport.Roque could not tell the actual date of inoculation of medical frontliners but has told Philippine General Hospital chief Dr. Gap Legaspi that there might be a need to prepare those who have consented to get inoculated by Monday.“I will have to coordinate. But I know, all we need is one day and then we will roll out. So, if it arrives on Sunday, if I am not mistaken, then we can rollout on Monday, because many of our fellow countrymen are already very excited,” he said.Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, meanwhile, again made a pitch for vaccination, saying it could at least protect an individual from getting severe case of COVID-19 even if it could not make him totally immune to the virus.“Number one, it will reduce death. Number two, it will reduce symptomatic cases, you can prevent the symptoms such as cough, fever and flu,” he said, explaining the vaccines’ benefits.“And it will prevent progression to severe form of COVID-19 infection. And, therefore, prevent hospitalization,” he said.Pitching for SinovacDuque said vaccines developed by Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and Sinovac have 100 percent efficacy rate in preventing severe COVID infection.“That’s the most important because deaths involved only those with severe cases,” he said.“So, if you are able to prevent severe infection, there will be no death. And Sinovac belongs to that group that offers or provides 100 percent efficacy or effectiveness. So I am not surprised that some countries, despite the indications in the issued emergency use authorization, they opted to still include their health care workers within the age group of 18 to 59 years,” Duque told the President at the IATF meeting on Wednesday.Meanwhile, the Department of Finance (DOF) has approved the inclusion of all COVID-19 vaccine imports under its Mabuhay express lane to expedite clearance of shipments and processing of tax and duty exemptions.Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III also approved the waiving of filing fees for vaccine applications under the Mabuhay Lane and the use of the Tax Exemption System (TES) Online Filing Module in processing of imports “to further support the government’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program.”Tax exemptions in the express lane, which is under the DOF’s revenue office, will be processed within 24 working hours.DOF said these tax exemption policies will be incorporated in the inter-agency guidelines for the implementation of a One-Stop Shop for International Donations and Government Procured COVID-19 Vaccines prepared by the DOF, DOH, Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA), Bureau of Customs (BOC) and the FDA.Finance Undersecretary Antonette Tionko recommended the inclusion of COVID-19 vaccine imports in the express lane “regardless of the applicable legal basis,” to “allow for the expedited processing of the tax and exemption of such applications.”The finance chief is authorized to include additional sectors that may avail themselves of the express service under the Mabuhay Lane.Vaccines donated to government agencies and accredited private entities would also be processed in the express lane.“We add that the Mabuhay Lane currently processes all Relief Consignment under Section 120 in relation to 121 of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act (CMTA). The Lane is expected to process all COVID-19 vaccines which may qualify as relief consignment,” said Tionko.Under the CMTA, relief consignment imported during a state of calamity and intended for the use of calamity victims shall be exempted from the payment of duties and taxes.The Mabuhay Lane was established to expedite the processing of applications for the tax and duty exemption of certain groups of importers, including export-oriented firms, returning residents, as well as non-profit, non-stock educational institutions. – Christina Mendez, Mayen Jaymalin, Neil Jayson Servallos, Czeriza Valencia"

The donation of vaccines is another testament to the solidarity as well as profound friendship and partnership between our two peoples and two countries,"" he also said.Roque said inoculations could begin immediately by March 1 with personnel of the Philippine General Hospital to be the first to receive it.While the Food and Drug Administration has issued an Emergency Use Approval to Sinovac, the local regulator advised against using it on medical workers as it yielded a 50% efficacy rate in clinical trials involving hospital personnel in Brazil.Despite this, Dr. Gerardo Legaspi, PGH director, said hospital personnel have signed uo to receive the Sinovac vaccines.""Our basis for accepting this is the EUA given by the FDA, because we all know that if it gives clearance, the safety and efficacy are assured,"" he said, partly in Filipino.Last week, the PGH said 94% of their employees have registered to receive the vaccine, which was 75% higher than their initial survey in January. Dr. Jonas del Rosario, PGH spokesperson, said vaccination could start as soon as Monday. The recent days have seen experts stressing on the public to trust the FDA's standards in issuing emergency use approvals. This came amid uncertainties over Sinovac's efficacy rate, as well as survey results showing that only 19% of adult Filipinos are willing to be vaccinated.Findings by the OCTA Research team released on Wednesday showed that 46% of respondents said they would opt out of receiving vaccines, which was not far from the 47% in Pulse Asia's poll just last month.READ: Less than a fifth of adult Filipinos willing to get COVID-19 jabs — OCTALegaspi added: ""The important thing to remember here is whatever vaccine comes, we should welcome it because it will make a difference in controling the spread of this infection, and I think the first area where we should control it is in the hospital.""Health workers are at the top of government's priority list of sectors to be vaccinated.Apart from the 600,000 donated doses of Sinovac, the administration signed a term sheet with the manufacturer for 25 million more doses.Pfizer and AstraZeneca's vaccines from the COVAX facility were supposedly the first to arrive in the Philippines with officials touting an indicative date by mid-February. Palace officials have sought to play down the delays, with the president's lawyer even saying that a few more days of waiting would not matter.Just a few days before February ends, the Philippines has over 566,000 coronavirus cases with deaths at more than 12,000. The said count remains the second highest in Southeast Asia, and the more infectious COVID-19 variant is already in the country along with two mutations detected.Nothing final yet, yet againThe health department and the national task force on the pandemic on Thursday afternoon clarified that vaccination might not actually start by March 1 as the Palace claimed.In a joint statement, officials said ""specific details as to the allocation and subsequent rollout"" of the 600,000 doses are still being evaluated by the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group and would need to be approved by the policy-setting IATF.While they also also confirmed that the vaccines would arrive in the coming days, details on the welcoming ceremony are also still being ironed out with the Chinese Embassy.The clarification hours after Roque's briefing was similar to how he said government would begin vaccinations by February 15, only later on to backtrack. Days later, the health department would also say that the given date was not definite."

This was highly policitized despite the lack of conclusive evidence that the vaccine developed by French firm Sanofi Pasteur caused the deaths of children inoculated with it during the previous administration.Concerns about safety, efficacyThose who do not want to get COVID-19 jabs once available were particularly concerned about the safety and efficacy of vaccines.Seventy three percent cited concern about the safety of vaccines as their top reason for their decision not to get inoculated. Concern about vaccine safety was highest in Mindanao (78%), followed by Balance Luzon (76%), Metro Manila (69%) and Visayas (64%).Twenty-nine percent of the respondents also said they will not get vaccinated because they are not sure if vaccines are effective. Concern about vaccine effectiveness was highest in Visayas (46%), followed by Metro Manila (34%), Mindanao (27%) and Balance Luzon (21%).So far, three vaccines have received emergency use authorization from the country’s Food and Drug Administration—those developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac.

But it is not an idea of the President. It is the idea of (Labor) Secretary (Silvestre) Bello (III) and (Foreign Affairs) Secretary (Teodoro) Locsin (Jr.) and we welcome it because more is better than less,” Roque said at a press briefing yesterday.The DOLE said the negotiation to secure vaccines from the UK and Germany is meant to protect the HCWs set for deployment abroad.“DOLE wishes to correct the sort of misquoted notion by some quarters about the intentions of sending or lifting of the cap in the number of nurses being requested by the UK and Germany. DOLE does not intend to treat our nurses as a commodity to be traded for vaccines,” DOLE information and public service director Rolly Francia said.Considering the generosity of the UK and German governments, Francia expressed DOLE’s belief that these countries would provide more vaccines for those they would hire and workers intending to seek employment abroad.The Department of Health (DOH) for its part said it was not consulted over a reported plan to trade off health workers for COVID-19 vaccines.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said they were not even aware of such exchange between our “government and other governments for this matter.”“We think if there is such kind of negotiation, this should be presented to the Inter-Agency Task Force so the IATF could decide on this,” Vergeire said.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon scored the DOLE for the supposed barter plan of HCWs, saying the move is a sign of desperation.Drilon said the DOLE’s palit bakuna initiative is a wrong policy and sets a bad precedent.“For the government to go this far as trading off its Filipino health care workers in exchange for vaccines means something is not right in the government’s coronavirus vaccination strategy,” he said. –  Alexis Romero, Mayen Jaymalin, Sheila Crisostomo, Paolo Romero, Delon Porcalla"

It is not clear yet, though, what vaccine brand will be inoculated to them.VSMMC is one of the priorities in the vaccination program of the national government, it being a COVID-19 government hospital.The science behindAccording to the World Health Organization, vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with the body’s natural defenses to build protection. When a person gets a vaccine, his or her immune system responds.It recognizes the invading germ, such as the virus or bacteria, and produces antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced naturally by the immune system to fight disease.The immune system then remembers the disease and how to fight it. If the person is then exposed to the germ in the future, his or her immune system can quickly destroy it before you become unwell.The vaccine, WHO says, is therefore a safe and clever way to produce an immune response in the body, without causing illness.""Our immune systems are designed to remember. Once exposed to one or more doses of a vaccine, we typically remain protected against a disease for years, decades or even a lifetime. This is what makes vaccines so effective. Rather than treating a disease after it occurs, vaccines prevent us in the first instance from getting sick,"" WHO adds. —  JMD (FREEMAN)"

The country’s FDA granted an EUA to CoronaVac Monday.The vaccine can be given to “clinically healthy” adults aged 18 to 59 but was not recommended for healthcare workers or the elderly.FDA Director General Eric Domingo explained that Sinovac is not the most ideal vaccine for medical frontliners because they are constantly exposed to COVID-19 patients.According to late stage trials in Brazil involving health workers who have had exposure to COVID-19 cases, the jabs yielded only a 50.4% efficacy rate—just above the World Health Organization’s threshold for vaccine use.Aside from Sinovac, the FDA has also issued EUAs to the vaccine of Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca.

He said he wanted to test the vaccine on himself because he was applying to be a local Sinopharm distributor.Related StoriesFDA approves compassionate use license on vaccines for PSG personnelMon Tulfo admits getting inoculated with smuggled Sinopharm shots, eyes local distributorshipThe columnist said he took the vaccine with some “Cabinet-level” officials, a senator and some members of the Presidential Security Group.The vaccine developed by a Chinese state-owned biotech firm has no authorization for emergency use in the Philippines. It has not even submitted application for such approval.FDA Director General Eric Domingo said the unauthorized vaccination activity will be referred to the agency’s regulatory enforcement unit for investigation.“We are investigating this because it is not good that we learn that there are individuals who get vaccinated without going through the right process,” Domingo said in a Laging Handa briefing Wednesday.In a separate briefing, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the ongoing probe into illegal vaccination activities will also include Tulfo.Agencies launched probes into the Presidential Security Group’s use of unregistered COVID-19 vaccines last year. Domingo said the FDA has yet to receive response from President Rodrigo Duterte’s security detail about their queries.The use of unregistered vaccines violates the Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009, which prohibits the distribution and administering of vaccines not yet approved by regulatory authorities.The DOH and the FDA have been saying that the use of unregistered products poses harm to a person’s health and safety.Local distributorTulfo said he has applied to be a local distributor of Sinopharm with a company called “Apollo.” He said the firm supposedly secured a contract with a Singapore subsidiary of Sinopharm.He denied using his position as special envoy to apply for local distributorship and secure vaccine doses for himself, his drivers and his bodyguards.Vergeire said individuals who are supplying illegally procured COVID-19 shots will be investigated. “If there will be violations, there will be sanctions.”Conflict of interestIn a briefing, presidential spokesperson Harry Roque avoided commenting on whether or not there is conflict of interest in Tulfo’s application to be a local distributor of the  Sinopharm vaccine.“We have no opinion whatsoever. We leave that to the ombudsman,” Roque said. He added he did not know about the columnist's claim that the president got in touch with a representative of Sinopharm. “I don’t understand the big deal about the Mon Tulfo write-up. That’s an account of Mon Tulfo. If you want verification, please contact Mon Tulfo,” he also said. When asked if the Palace found the admission of unauthorized vaccination alarming, the presidential spokesperson replied: ""I don’t have any reaction to that because I understand that during a pandemic, many want to have protection. But we’re telling everybody to wait for the product to undergo the proper process.""Tulfo argued there is no conflict of interest because he is a “private citizen,” claiming he is “technically not a government official” because his position as special envoy is only “honorific.”In December last year, Duterte revealed that PSG members already got vaccinated against COVID-19 even if the FDA has yet to issue an EUA at the time. Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante, PSG commander, confirmed it, leaving health authorities surprised and the public enraged.The FDA eventually issued a “compassionate use license” for the president’s security detail to take 10,000 Sinopharm shots last February 11.Three vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the Philippines—Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac—but so far none have been delivered and the government is under criticism over the delayed vaccine rollout."

Let us not disregard our fellowmen who do not know where to get vaccine or those who don’t even know what and for where these vaccines are,” he said in Filipino as a reminder to authorities.The senator also appealed to the public to trust health experts and rely on credible sources of information to be aware and to fully understand why vaccination is crucial in overcoming the pandemic toward full recovery.“Let us trust our government because it is doing everything to protect the lives of every Filipino,” he said.Meanwhile, Go is asking for an explanation from the FDA on its decision to not recommend the use of China’s Sinovac vaccine on medical frontliners.In an ambush interview right after he distributed assistance to market and ambulant vendors in Baclaran, Parañaque City, the senator said FDA director general Eric Domingo should explain to the public why they have to set such conditions and why they choose the type of vaccines that will be used by health workers.“I will ask FDA director general Eric Domingo why there are such conditions. This must be cleared before the public to avoid confusion or fear among the people on why vaccines are chosen,” he said.Go’s statement came after Domingo disclosed that they have approved the emergency use authorization (EUA) of Sinovac vaccines in the Philippines, but would not recommend the use of this brand on medical frontliners due to its lower efficacy rate of 50.4 percent, based on clinical trials worldwide.National Task Force against COVID-19 (NTF) chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. earlier said a total of 600,000 doses of Sinovac vaccines would be donated to the Philippines by the Chinese government. The Philippines also plans to buy more doses from Sinovac on top of what will be donated.While awaiting the vaccine rollout, Go reminded the public to remain vigilant, cooperate with authorities and trust that the government is doing everything it can to overcome the ongoing health crisis.He also appealed for understanding from the public for the difficulties encountered in securing the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines and emphasized that the government is doing its best to fast-track the procurement of the vaccines.“The government is doing everything, Secretary Galvez is doing everything. The problem here is the supply of vaccines all over the world,” Go said.Barring any hitches, the government remains hopeful that the over 500,000 Sinovac vaccines from China will be arriving in the country three to five days after the FDA granted the EUA of the Chinese vaccine manufacturer.Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles made the announcement after the government missed its original schedule of arrival for the Sinovac vaccines yesterday.The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases, along with the National Immunization Technical Advisory Group, has been assured of the vaccines’ arrival shortly after the issuance of the EUA. – Sheila Crisostomo, Cecille Suerte Felipe, Michael Punongbayan"

The rating was only slightly higher than the World Health Organization's threshhold for deciding on vaccine use.Efficacies of same vaccine vary depending on test group This was backed by Dr. Rontgene Solante, an infectious diseases expert at the San Lazaro Hospital in Manila.Speaking to ONE News' ""The Chiefs"" on Monday night, he explained that vaccines have different efficacies depending on the group of individuals it was tested on. ""In this particular study (Brazil), they found out that the efficacy among these high-risk health workers is really low,"" he said. ""That's the beauty of a Phase 3 clinical trial, you will be able to know and look at [the] efficacy of the vaccines in different target population.""The clinical trials in Jakarta and Ankara involved volunteers from various fields, while the one in Brasilia was concentrated on medical personnel. Solante said the 50.4% efficacy was from a study focused on high-risk health workers who face different levels of exposure than regular people do.""If you are a frontliner and you are seeing patients... perhaps your risk could be at 50 to 60%,"" Solante said partly in Filipino. ""But if you are in the general population and not working in a hospital, your risk is really lower than that of health workers.""Hospital personnel are at the top of government's priority list to be vaccinated for the coronavirus, followed by senior citizens, the indigenous and marginalized as well as the police and military.Already, the Philippines is set to receive some 600,000 doses of Sinovac as a donation from Beijing, while the administration has signed a term sheet with the company for 25 million more doses.'Trust the experts'The arrival of other brands of vaccines, however, is facing significant delays particularly the 117,000 doses of Pfizer and 5.5 million of AstraZeneca from the COVAX facility.""We are placing our health workers and elderly people at further risk every day in the delay of the vaccine procurement,"" said Rep.

""[They] were there, they really looked at the data and as I have always mentioned, we have to trust the experts.""Aside from securing the jabs amid a global race, the Philippines has had to struggle with ramping up the public's trust on getting vaccinated once the doses arrive.It came after a Pulse Asia survey in January revealed that 47% said they would not be inoculated with most of them concerned on its safety.Adding to doubts on Sinovac is criticism of the government for seeming to favor the Chinese-made jabs over others that have reported higher efficacy rates.To date, Sinovac has yet to submit its Phase 3 clinical trial data to medical journals for peer review, unlike its competitors Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Moderna.Despite the concerns, Bravo maintained that the ""best vaccine is the one that will be available to you [that] is approved by the experts.""""I have seen how they have discussed and painfully debate all the issues that are here,"" she said.

Sonny Angara called “regulatory barriers.”Among these is the provision which allows the Department of Health and the National Task Force Against COVID-19 (NTF) to buy COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies for its storage, transport and deployment through negotiated procurement instead of public bidding.It also allows local government units to buy COVID-19 vaccines through a tripartite agreement with the national government and the supplier of the shot. Private entities may also purchase their own vaccines through the same way.The bill also provides that COVID-19 vaccines and the necessary supplies will be exempted from customs duties, value-added tax, excise tax, donor’s tax and other fees and charges.It also directs the DOH to issue a vaccine passport to all Filipinos which would contain basic personal information, the COVID-19 vaccine given to them, and the health facility where the shot was received.The bill initially suggested that those who have completed COVID-19 immunization may be granted perks, but this was dropped in the final measure."

My understanding is there’s no requirement in the case of AstraZeneca for further exchange of letters between the manufacturer and the Philippines,” said Rabindra Abeyashinge, WHO country representative.The Philippines is expected to receive around 5.5 million to 9.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine this year.“What we're looking at now is accelerating the delivery of AstraZeneca vaccines at least a part of the shipment to the Philippines,” he said. The WHO official also said the “impasse” between the Philippines and American vaccine manufacturer Pfizer on the delivery of much awaited COVID-19 shots may be resolved soon after the government received a side letter from the drugmaker. A side letter is a document used as a supplementary to a contract.“We believe that within the day today or tomorrow or whenever the legal teams have cleared those documents, we will see a resolution of that impasse and maybe there will be room to hear about when potential vaccine deliveries can happen,” Abeyasinghe said.Three vaccines have been approved for emergency use in the Philippines—Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca and Sinovac—but so far none have been delivered and the government is under criticism over the delayed vaccine rollout.Officials said the delivery of 117,000 doses of vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech faced delays due to requirements such as indemnification.‘No link to Dengvaxia’Abeyasinghe also said the requirement of COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers for the Philippines to submit indemnification agreements is not connected to the country’s experience with Dengvaxia.Last week, vaccine czar Carlito Galvez said drugmakers were concerned with the country’s previous experiences with anti-dengue vaccine Dengvaxia. The government submitted indemnification agreements to access vaccine doses through the COVAX facility.But Abeyasinghe clarified that the “requirements and the standard agreements are common to all countries.”“They’re not specific to the Philippines and they’re not related to any issue that happened in the country relating to Dengvaxia or anything else,” Abeyasinghe said.“The indemnification clause is something manufacturers are demanding from every country irrespective of whether they are buying from manufacturers or whether they are receiving vaccines through the COVAX facility or some other mechanism,” he added.The controversy was highly politicized despite the lack of conclusive evidence that the vaccine developed by French firm Sanofi Pasteur caused the deaths of children inoculated with it during the previous administration.The fiasco also eroded public trust in life-saving vaccines. A survey of pollster Pulse Asia released last month showed nearly half of Filipinos would opt out of inoculation. — Gaea Katreena Cabico"

The HCWs, particularly nurses, are highly in demand in European countries due to the aging population.While DOLE is still waiting for feedback, Visperas is optimistic that the requests will be granted. The UK government, she said, is expected to send a response within the week.If the UK and Germany will agree to provide vaccines, DOLE will use them for OFWs who were displaced by the pandemic as well as those who will be going back abroad, she added.Visperas explained that Bello wanted to secure the vaccines for OFWs because vaccination is now becoming a common requirement for entering foreign migrants.Some Philippine Overseas Labor Offices (POLOs) reported that a number of destination countries for OFWs are no longer accepting migrants not vaccinated against COVID, she said.Based on DOLE data, over 570,000 OFWs were displaced by the pandemic, thus the need to secure at least 600,000 vaccines from UK and Germany.Meanwhile, the country’s discussions with Russia on the possible purchase of COVID-19 vaccines are now at a “very advanced stage,” said Manila’s envoy to Moscow Ambassador Carlos Sorreta.He noted that the vaccines would be acquired through a government-to-government commercial agreement and not through donation because the Duterte administration is ready to pay for the COVID-19 shots.“Our discussions on a technical level with Russia are in a very advanced stage. Right now, we are waiting for additional information, technical data being sought by the Philippines. Once it is obtained, I think that’s the final step for our FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to make a decision,” Sorreta said at a press briefing.“And once they make a decision, the Russian side is ready to sit down and sign, which they have done already with 30 countries, and there are 50 other counties lined up. So I think that’s the next step… If we make a decision soon and give the approval, I think the vaccines can come in a fairly quick amount of time,” he added.He noted that it is hard to give a timeline for the procurement but the Philippines is constantly following up on the information it is seeking from Russia.Russia has offered to supply the Philippines Sputnik V vaccines developed by Gamaleya Research Institute. Sorreta said the Russian vaccine is available commercially in that country and some Filipinos have availed themselves of it.“If you go to a private doctor, you can avail of it... Aside from medical centers in our areas, they set up vaccination facilities in the malls. Filipinos frequent malls and perhaps after shopping or eating at the food court, they drop by the vaccination center,” the envoy said. – Alexis Romero"

The measure allows local governments to purchase vaccines in advance, expediting the procurement process.Local government units have been allowed to accept donations from the private sector or purchase an equivalent of 50 percent of their total population, but they are not authorized to buy from vaccine dealers except from direct manufacturers.Meanwhile, the private sector has to deal with either the Department of Health or the National Task Force, for which such vaccines can only be administered to their employees and should not be sold commercially.Public officials, employees, contractors, volunteers and representatives of the private sector will also be exempt from any liability should problems arise with regard to effects after the inoculation.WHO safeguards solidarity trialsMeanwhile, World Health Organization (WHO) has put insurance safeguards for any adverse events during the Solidarity Vaccine Trials (SVT) conducted in the country in search of candidate COVID-19 vaccines.Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD) executive director Dr. Jaime Montoya said that while the SVT is voluntary, WHO has arranged for an insurance agreement with a provider, for any adverse events.“Just in case there are adverse events, it will be immediately managed by our doctors, whether or not it’s related to the vaccine. If this is related to the vaccines according to a study by our experts, they can claim indemnity from the insurance agreement made by the World Health Organization,” Montoya said in Filipino.He revealed that the SVT will involve 15,000 volunteers and 20 sites are being prepared as the WHO determines which vaccines will be included.Senate amendmentsAs of press time, the Senate was still writing amendments to Senate Bill 2057, the counterpart proposal to the House measure.Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon proposed an amendment that requires a tripartite agreement with government for the purchase and importation of COVID-19 vaccines.Earlier in the day, Sen. Panfilo Lacson said the national government should treat the private sector as partners rather than competitors through over-regulation.Senate President Vicente Sotto III stressed the need for government to focus on treatment and cure of COVID-19 while in the process of procuring the vaccines.Sen.

They are the people working in industries that remained open while we were under ECQ (enhanced community quarantine),” the Palace spokesman said in Filipino.“Our vaccination will continue, it won’t be disrupted.If we cannot give them to seniors and health care workers, we have many critical economic frontliners who can be vaccinated,” he added.Roque said the poor could also be inoculated if the supply agreement involving the procurement of one million Sinovac doses pushes through.“We did not choose this but look, we really have a God who says that the poor in the Philippines should be prioritized in the vaccines,” he added.He revealed that the 75-year-old Duterte has expressed preference for COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Sinopharm, also a Chinese firm.Earlier this month, the FDA allowed the compassionate use of 10,000 doses of Sinopharm vaccines for members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) and their families.PSG chief Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III had admitted that some of Duterte’s security aides had been inoculated against COVID-19 as early as September last year.

Beijing committed to donate 600,000 doses of the Chinese-made coronavirus jab, of which 100,000 will be allocated to military personnel. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III said Monday that the Chinese Embassy in Manila need three to five days to prepare the vaccine shipment once EUA is issued. The EUA will be valid only within the duration of the declared public health emergency or upon the issuance of certificate of product registration, which is the typical license issued to products. Not best vaccine for health workersThe authorization clears CoronaVac for use on “clinically healthy” individuals aged 18 and 59 years after it was found to have an efficacy rate of 65.3% in clinical trials held in Indonesia and 91.25% in the study conducted in Turkey. But late-stage trials in Brazil had shown an efficacy rate of 50.4%—just above the threshold the World Health Organization uses to decide if a vaccine is worth using. Brazil conducted trials with healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients only.""The use of Sinovac vaccine on healthcare workers is not recommended,"" Domingo said, explaining that CoronaVac is not the most ideal vaccine to administer to medical frontliners because of their constant exposure to the virus.Medical frontliners are at the top of the government's priority list for COVID-19 vaccination. Aside from them, senior citizens, indigent population and uniformed personnel are also among the priority groups. “The safety profile is good, adverse events were mild to moderate. The possibility of allergy and severe allergy or anaphylaxis is minimal,” the FDA chief said in a mix of English and Filipino. Unlike competitor vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, Sinovac has yet to submit Phase 3 clinical trial data to medical journals for peer review. The AstraZeneca shot was found to be 70% effective on average.

Not necessarily, says expert","MANILA, Philippines — Vaccines for COVID-19 do not necessarily prevent infection and transmission of the virus but it could protect those inoculated against severe illness, an official of the Department of Health (DOH) said on Friday night.Enrique Tayag, DOH director for Knowledge Management and IT Service, explained that clinical trials for COVID-19 vaccines are not yet finished but these were released by manufacturers through an emergency use authorization (EUA) issued by regulatory authorities of countries.This means that people can still get infected although “there will be no severe COVID-19,” he said in an interview with The Chiefs on Cignal TV’s OneNews.“(From) what we know...it proves that it protects against severe COVID-19 and prevents hospitalization,” the former DOH chief epidemiologist added in reference to the case of a 43-year-old overseas Filipino worker in Mandaue City in Cebu.The OFW had two doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine while still in the United Arab Emirates. He went though a 14-day quarantine after arriving in Cebu. However, when tested before flying back to the UAE, he turned positive for the virus.Four of his household members were also found infected, although it could not be ascertained if they got the virus from him.Tayag said that “timing is important for vaccination” as a person could already be “incubating” the infection when vaccinated. He also underscored the need to get the complete two shots to acquire maximum protection.A 24-year-old OFW from Canada also tested positive for COVID-19 after arriving in Cebu last Feb. 9. She was swab tested on Feb. 14, the fifth day of her quarantine, and found positive. It turned out that she was given her first dose of Pfizer vaccine last Jan. 13 in Canada but failed to get the second dose.Meanwhile, the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is targeting to inoculate close to 1,000 health care personnel and non-medical workers per day once the vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech arrives.Hospital director Gerardo Legaspi said that, based on their simulation, they could give shots to 975 individuals per day.“If we want to vaccinate 975 people – because one tray per day – we will need nine vaccinators and 54 monitoring (seats),” he said at a recent briefing organized by the Department of Health.Based on pre-registration, at least 94.1 percent or 5,745 of the 6,316 workers PGH workers have signed up for vaccination. These are composed of health workers, non-medical personnel, student-interns and consultants, among others, regardless of employment status.According to Legaspi, the simulation revealed they could inoculate six people per vial with the “saline solution” they are using. However, to get six doses from one vial, they would have to use “low-dead space syringes.”The PGH, he said, is having difficulty in finding a supplier for this syringe type.He also foresees a “big bottleneck” in the screening procedures and recommended that the DOH allow them to forego blood pressure screening for those who are not hypertensive.“Taking BP and pulse takes time. If they are not hypertensive to begin with, maybe we can (do away with it),” Legaspi explained.He noted that their registration activities allowed them to know the quantity of vaccines needed and to do “eligibility checks.”"

It is also possible for one of the chambers to simply adopt the other house’s version.The arrival of doses of Pfizer/BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccines from the World Health Organization-led COVAX facility was delayed due to the need for an indemnity program that provides that the government, and not the manufacturers, would be held liable for adverse effects due to the shots.Senators on Wednesday said that if they had been informed of the need for an indemnity fund sooner, they would have addressed it. Galvez, for his part, has said that this requirement was only recently raised by the COVAX facility and other suppliers.The Philippines is among the laggards in Southeast Asia in terms of coronavirus vaccinations, with the country yet to finalize a single supply agreement for the coveted shots and yet to receive a single dose.This, despite the country having the second-worst outbreak of COVID-19 in the region, with over 555,500 cases and over 11,000 deaths. — with a report from Bella Perez-Rubio"

Yet progress on vaccinations has been wildly uneven and unfair,” Guterres said.“The world urgently needs a Global Vaccination Plan to bring together all those with the required power, expertise and production capacities,” he said.The UN and partners have established the COVAX Facility to ensure countries would have access to vaccines, regardless of their wealth. The UN official said the mechanism must be fully funded.Guterres proposed that the world’s richest countries, the G20 nations, form an Emergency Task Force to prepare a plan and coordinate its implementation and financing.With UN support, the task force should work to mobilize pharmaceutical companies and key industry and logistics actors, he said.The UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) is assisting countries in preparation for COVID-19 vaccine distribution, aiming to procure two billion doses by the end of the year.“This historic effort deserves historic support,” said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF executive director. “Help us ensure that the light at the end of the tunnel shines on us all — including the families and communities enduring the horrors of conflict.”Fore underscored UN Security Council’s support is necessary for getting countries to ensure that all people are included in national vaccination plans, regardless of their status or even if they live in areas not under government control."

Last evening, I was made to understand that this may happen within the next two weeks,” Abeyasinghe said during the Laging Handa public briefing yesterday.While he noted that Pfizer has not sent out indemnification agreement yet to any of the countries that are eligible for the vaccination rollout, he gave assurance that the COVAX facility is working closely with the firm to make sure that it sends this out—the last step waiting to be accomplished for the delivery of vaccines.On top of the vaccines arriving in the next two weeks, Abeyasinghe said, another shipment of vaccines may also be delivered by late March or early April.He further reported that additional AstraZeneca vaccines are ready for possible shipment to the Philippines if all requirements are complied with.“What I said is that there is a quantity of vaccine that have been readied for shipment. They are not earmarked for the Philippines. But if the Philippines can meet the requirements that are necessary, maybe we will be able to access these vaccines too,” Abeyasinghe said.He added that WHO is also looking to grant Emergency Use Listing, which opens the way for the delivery of vaccines, to several other potential COVID vaccines.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) stressed that due to limited global supply, Filipinos don’t have the luxury of choosing which brand they would be vaccinated with.In a television interview, FDA director general Eric Domingo said pharmaceutical firms are only capable of supplying a certain amount of vaccines to the Philippines.“There is no single vaccine company that will be able to supply all our requirements. For example, Pfizer; it can only deliver a few million this 2021. So, this means that we would have to source 20 to 30 million somewhere from the vaccines that will be approved by the FDA,” he pointed in Filipino.At the House committee on people’s participation hearing yesterday, Domingo revealed that Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, which manufactures the Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19, has not yet secured an emergency use authorization (EUA) in the country due to incomplete requirements.He said the FDA has already sought the assistance of the Russian embassy here to expedite the processing of EUA application.So far, only Pfizer and AstraZeneca have secured EUAs from the FDA. The Chinese vaccine maker Sinovac also has not secured the required authorization yet.“We need some documents of course to be attested to by the manufacturer and we know the manufacturer is in Russia and it’s very difficult for some documents to go there and get here,” Domingo told members of the House panel.He added that Gamaleya also needs to submit a good manufacturing practice (GMP) certification, which is required to “assure the consistency of the quality of the product.”Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon lamented that the Philippines is still scrambling to secure supplies when six out of 10 countries in Southeast Asia have already begun their vaccination programs.He cited Singapore, Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar as among the countries that have started rolling out the jabs, which left the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Thailand behind.“Many are baffled by our situation. Out of the 10 countries in Southeast Asia, six have already started inoculating their citizens,” Drilon said during a Senate session Wednesday. “Why is it that we still do not have the vaccination until now?”Drilon said the government targets to inoculate at least 70 million Filipinos to achieve herd immunity but has not signed any supply agreement for COVID-19 vaccines yet.“I cannot emphasize this enough: our survival as a nation largely depends on our ability to ensure immediate access and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to our people. At the rate things are going, however, Filipinos have to wait longer,” he added.He reiterated that apart from Filipinos’ lack of confidence in COVID-19 vaccines, politics poses a challenge to the government’s mass vaccination program against coronavirus. — Cecille Suerte Felipe, Alexis Romero"

It’s quick, usually the inspection only takes three days,” Domingo said in a mix of English and Filipino.For its part, the Russian Embassy assured that it would assist the Philippine team who would go to Russia to inspect the vaccine’s factory.“In this case, I suppose, we will give full visa assistance. We will issue visas as soon as possible,” Vladislav Mongush, the embassy's first secretary, said.Another crucial document lacking for the speedy approval of Sputnik V for emergency use is an authorization from its manufacturer that would allow Philippine Archipelago International Trading Corp. to sign documents on their behalf.Domingo said it would be “a lot faster” if the vaccine’s local distributor would be able to sign documents on their behalf.“We need some documents, of course, to be attested to by the manufacturer, and we know the manufacturer is in Russia and it’s very difficult for some documents to go there and then get here,” he said.Domingo also said that vaccine experts are still “fine-tuning” their recommendations on the safety and efficacy of Sputnik V, particularly on whether it would be effective for Filipinos as it uses a modified virus to deliver instructions to cells.He said the Department of Science and Technology is conducting a study whether many Filipinos have already been infected with adenovirus-5, the viral vector used in Sputnik V, which he said may potentially lessen the efficacy of the vaccine.He also said that the Gamaleya National Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology, which developed the vaccine, submitted Thursday more documents to support their application for emergency use authorization (EUA) and that regulatory officers are currently checking these.Gamaleya applied last January 6 for an EUA for Sputnik V, which, according to a study published in The Lancet medical journal is 91.6% effective.Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer of the Russian Direct Investment Fund which bankrolled Sputnik V, previously said that Russia is ready to supply COVID-19 vaccines to the Philippines as soon as it secures an EUA."

At least the initial 117,000 doses from Pfizer and at least five million doses from AstraZeneca,” Roque said.About 600,000 Sinovac vaccines donated by China will be arriving in Manila on Feb. 23, Roque said.“We are not lagging in our vaccination plan,” he said.Indemnification fundThe government has proposed a funding of P500 million for indemnification of those who will experience adverse effects as a result of getting COVID-19 vaccines, according to Galvez.He said they are still waiting for the signing of indemnification agreements with pharmaceutical firms before proceeding with the inoculation program.“We have accomplished the documentation for the vaccine procurement. We just need to sign the indemnification agreement,” Galvez said.The indemnification bill remains pending at the House of Representatives and Senate.Galvez said the measure has been endorsed by Senate President Tito Sotto and Sen. Bong Go.WHO OKs AstraZeneca jab for emergency useThe World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday listed AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use, widening access to the relatively inexpensive vaccine in the Philippines.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) yesterday welcomed the granting of emergency use listing (EUL) to AstraZeneca, saying this would pave the way for the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines to the country.“The EUL will allow the COVAX Facility to send AstraZeneca vaccines to the Philippines,” FDA director general Eric Domingo said.The FDA issued emergency use authorization to AstraZeneca on Jan. 28.At least 9.2 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine are being secured by the Philippines.Aside from AstraZeneca, the WHO also issued EUL to Pfizer-BioNTech last December.The Philippine government is expecting 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to arrive in the country this month from COVAX Facility, a system initiated by the WHO.EUL is a procedure that assesses the suitability of new health products during public health emergencies to make them available as soon as possible.Vaccine paymentThe League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) has urged President Duterte to issue an Executive Order authorizing city mayors to make advance payments for COVID-19 vaccines contracted by local governments.“With his authority to allow advance payment, local vaccination programs can be set in accelerated motion,” Bacolod City Mayor Evelio Leonardia, who chairs the LCP, said. – Sheila Crisostomo, Delon Porcalla, Gilbert Bayoran"

Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said of the number, around 500 police officers replied positively in a survey conducted in the police force.“There were comments that they need more information about the vaccines, they need more time,” Eleazar told reporters.He said on top of the PNP’s priority list are personnel of the PNP General Hospital and those who would be providing security to vaccination teams during the rollout of the inoculation program this month.The PNP is also considering other factors in prioritizing personnel such as those assigned in areas with high number of COVID-19 infections, including Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao and Baguio, Eleazar said.“Our health service came up with vaccination videos for the appreciation of our personnel. We are trying to convince them to get vaccinated,” he said.The PNP, which has over 200,000 personnel nationwide, is among the priorities in the government’s vaccination program.Meanwhile, PNP Directorate for Operations chief Maj. Gen. Alfred Corpuz said they have not received any threats against health workers who would be distributing COVID-19 vaccines nationwide.Corpuz, however, did not rule out the possibility that communist rebels and other groups “remain a threat to the vaccination program of the government.”He said security operations would begin when the vaccines arrive in the country."

We have never hit this number of people ever since we’ve launched the ‘A Dose of Hope,’ so that shows that everybody here is eager to get out of this pandemic,” Concepcion noted.“I’m glad that with our discussion with Kishore of Faberco, he has appointed Unilab to handle the private sector orders, while they handle the LGU and national government orders,” he said.Unilab has set the minimum order at 200 doses with an option for smaller companies to consolidate among themselves, making it more accessible especially for MSMEs.“Now, our role here is to support Unilab in its efforts to get orders. We will endorse all orders to Unilab, our staff will take down the orders and help follow through on any issues with them. That is the role that the Go Negosyo’s A Dose of Hope will be playing in this program with Faberco and Unilab – use our experience in the initial program with AstraZeneca to really make the Novavax vaccine accessible to as many private sectors who need it, especially our MSMEs,” Concepcion added.The collaboration is intended to help the workforce, the most valuable asset of companies, and to find solutions to protect them against COVID-19.He said safeguarding the health of the people through vaccination is highly encouraged.“This is how we could show gratitude to our everyday heroes. Together with Unilab, your trusted quality health care partner, we will bring Covovax to the private sector to help our economy get back up,” said Kishore Hemlani, founder of Faberco Life Sciences Inc.At the briefing, Unilab was represented by Jose Maria Ochave, SVP for social partnerships of Unilab, with Dr. Nancy Bernal, medical director of Unilab, and Manolet Montinola, VP of Unilab.“Bayanihan has always been a cornerstone of our policies. It has always been with us. So, we thought that this is a good vaccine and in the spirit of Bayanihan, we said, why don’t we offer it to the rest, and fortunately, Faberco said yes. They can take care of the government sector and we can take care of the private sector. We’re a 100 percent Filipino-owned company, we sink and we swim with the country,” Ochave said.Bernal presented the Covovax efficacy and safety profile, efficacy set at 89.3 percent with no severe adverse effect, and Montinola presented the particulars of the partnership, including its objectives, dosage and administration, age indication, supply chain management with focus on transport and storage, the projected date of supply which is on the third quarter of 2021 and the partnership terms with private sectors that will procure through Unilab.The indicative cost for the vaccine is currently set at P1,000 per dose, exclusive of VAT, inclusive of logistics and delivery nationwide to Department of Health-approved vaccination hospital/site. This is not including the cost of administering the vaccine, which depends on the hospital or site where the vaccination will be administered – a hospital or site of choice of the private company that procured the vaccine, as long as the hospital or site is DOH-accredited.Orders to Unilab also extend to family members of each employee, given that the administration still follows the government’s prioritization."

If a bill is certified by the President as urgent, it may be passed by Congress on second and third reading on the same day.Currently, local governments can only buy COVID-19 shots through a tripartite agreement with the national government and suppliers. Roque previously said the procurement law has to be amended to allow local governments to pay in advance.He has also assured the public that the national government is prepared to buy vaccines for everyone even if some local governments are procuring their own COVID-19 doses.Despite the delay in the delivery of Pfizer vaccines, the government remains optimistic that the vaccination program would start within the month.“The timetable will remain. Our timetable is (to inoculate) 50 to 70 million (Filipinos) within the year,” Roque said.“With regard to Sinovac, we are still hopeful that the delay is only about one week; but in any case, there is a written letter from no less than the COVAX Facility saying that delivery will be in mid-February,” he added.Roque said vaccines produced by Chinese drug maker Sinovac are expected to arrive on Feb. 23. It is also possible for the Pfizer vaccines purchased through the COVAX facility to arrive before Feb. 23, he added.“We cannot tell with precision when the vaccines purchased through the COVAX Facility would arrive but for sure, we can start within the month of February. If it’s not Valentines, well belated Kung Hei Fat Choi,” he added, using the Chinese new year greeting.Asked what is holding up the signing of an actual agreement for the purchase of vaccines, Roque said the term sheet is also a “perfected contract.”“It is also a perfected contract because the consent, object and consideration are complete... We are just waiting for the contract of sale,” he said.League of Cities’ appealMore than a hundred LGUs are asking President Duterte to issue an executive order authorizing the advance payment for COVID-19 vaccines they are set to procure for their residents.In a resolution dated Feb. 4, 114 member-cities of the League of Cities of the Philippines (LCP) said the advance payments for tripartite agreements they signed for vaccine acquisition are due on Feb. 24.Citing Presidential Decree 1445, the local executives’ body said “cities need an express authorization and issuance from President Duterte such as an executive order allowing them to procure vaccines and proceed with the required advance payment market provisions in their respective agreements with the pharmaceutical companies.”“LCP members seek the urgent action of the Office of the President to issue the necessary executive order at the soonest possible time,” the resolution read.The resolution did not mention which cities were asking for the executive order, but it did say that the cities in question had inked tripartite agreements with AstraZeneca under the A Dose of Hope Program last Jan. 14.Copies of the resolution have been sent to several offices including the Office of the Executive Secretary, Department of Budget and Management, Commission on Audit, Department of Health, Department of the Interior and Local Government, National Task Force against COVID-19 and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF).Tax reliefIn their plea, the LGUs have found support from the House committee on ways and means which approved yesterday the tax provision of a bill that seeks to authorize them to directly purchase COVID-19 vaccines from pharmaceutical companies.The panel stamped its approval on Section 6 of House Bill 8648 (Emergency Vaccine Procurement Act of 2021) that provides tax exemptions for the procurement, importation, storage, transport, distribution and administration of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines by LGUs.These vaccines would be exempted from customs duties, value-added tax, excise tax and other fees, provided the shots to be acquired by LGUs “shall only be used for their residents and constituents and not for commercial distribution.”Last week, the panel headed by Albay Rep. Joey Salceda also approved HB 8648, which generally seeks to expedite the purchase and administration of vaccines by allowing LGUs to directly purchase from foreign manufacturers.Speaker Lord Allan Velasco, who authored the bill, said this mechanism would ensure that vaccines are “procured and administered in an expeditious, effective, efficient and equitable manner.”“The next crucible in the fight against the pandemic is the speedy procurement and effective administration of vaccines against the deadly disease,” the Marinduque congressman said.“Time is of the essence. Each day of delay is very costly for the government and leaves many of our vulnerable countrymen exposed to the dangers of this disease.”Camarines Sur Rep. LRay Villafuerte called on officials of the vaccination program to focus on fast-tracking the training of personnel at the LGU level in the proper storage, handling and administration of the temperature-sensitive vaccine doses.“In CamSur, we already have a list of the priority beneficiaries across the province as well as the list of frontliners who are to administer the vaccines,” Villafuerte said.He said this will avoid wastage and keep the government on track in its target of immunizing 70 million Filipino adults by yearend.“Our frontliners need to be properly trained on how to administer the shots. LGU staff should also be trained on the proper storage of the meds. Another thing is that there are certain municipalities that have no adequate cold storage facilities to keep the vaccines,” he pointed out.“Based on reports, the government plans to start the vaccination program once the vaccines from the COVAX Facility arrive. Frontline health care workers caring for patients in high-risk areas will be given top priority in the initial rollout,” the Bicolano congressman said.Pfizer doses for 34 hospitalsThirty-four hospitals will receive the initial batch of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines that the Philippines will acquire through the COVAX Facility, the DOH said yesterday.Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said 32 of the hospitals “eligible to receive the vaccines” are in the National Capital Region and two are in Davao and in Cebu.“We had a meeting with them last Friday,” she told a press conference. These hospitals will receive initially 117,000 doses that are expected to arrive this month from the COVAX Facility of the World Health Organization.These doses will primarily be given to medical and non-medical workers in these hospitals.Vergeire added the hospitals were directed to submit to DOH their “verified list of vaccinees plus their quick substitution list (QSL).”“As of today, most of our hospitals were already able to submit their complete lists. There are just some hospitals that are still completing their QSLs,” she said.One of the hospitals that will receive the vaccines is the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) which is readying its QSL to prevent vaccine wastage.PGH director Gerardo Legaspi said the vaccination program got “overwhelming support” from some 6,000 PGH workers, as 94 percent of them have signed up to be inoculated.This is higher than the 74 percent acceptance rate posted by the workers in a survey done a month ago.Legaspi admitted the increase in vaccine confidence can be due to the knowledge that the vaccine that will arrive first in the country is from Pfizer.However, the delivery of the Pfizer vaccines has been delayed from the initial target of Feb. 15.He added there are enough alternative vaccinees in case some of those who registered back out.Vergeire said the one-week delay in the delivery of the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccines has given the government enough time to fine-tune the vaccine rollout. – Delon Porcalla, Sheila Crisostomo, Rudy Santos"

Anything that would assure them that there is nothing to worry about and in the event of untoward side effects they are protected,” Robredo said in her program over dzXL on Sunday.Sen. Nancy Binay has filed Senate Bill 2015, seeking to establish a vaccine indemnification fund to boost public confidence in the efficacy of the vaccines and compensate those who would suffer adverse side effects.Robredo also said she believes health experts should educate the public regarding the importance of immunization against COVID-19.“To me, it will add to the confidence of the people if many health experts will talk about the vaccines and will be interviewed,” she said. “It boosts the confidence of the public when they hear it from the doctors, whom they trust, that there is nothing to fear.”Some 5,640 health workers and non-medical personnel out of 6,000 of the Philippine General Hospital have registered for the COVID-19 vaccination, according to PGH spokesman Jonas del Rosario.Del Rosario, who recovered from COVID-19 last year, will be the first person to receive the COVID-19 shot.“This is symbolic, very meaningful, because if we recall Dr. Jonas caught COVID-19. He lost his parents due to COVID-19,” Robredo said.PGH is one of four COVID-19 referral hospitals prioritized for vaccine distribution. The others are the Lung Center of the Philippines and East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City and Dr. Jose Natalio Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center in Caloocan City.They are expected to receive part of the 117,000 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from the COVAX Facility, a global vaccine-sharing program."

The collective goal for both the private sector and government is to vaccinate as many people as possible at the soonest possible time,” Guillermo Luz, chief resilience officer of the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation, a T3 member, said in a statement.Luz said that these initial vaccine doses have been earmarked by the national government for priority sectors led by health care professionals and senior citizens.“Our medical frontliners have been tirelessly protecting and treating Filipinos from the beginning of the pandemic and we support the government’s prioritization of health care workers in receiving the initial vaccine doses,” Paolo Borromeo, CEO of AC Health, another T3 member, added.For the vaccination rollout, Taskforce T3, in partnership with the Department of Health and the National Task Force (NTF) against COVID-19, is developing a vaccine education campaign to inform citizens about vaccine safety and efficacy.T3 is also providing technical support on vaccine administration and cold-chain logistics for the transit of temperature-controlled vaccine vials.All these efforts of Taskforce T3 are on top of the vaccine doses donated by the private sector to the national government part of the procurement by the private sector for its economic and essential frontliners.The private sector procurement is intended to augment the supply purchased by the national government and the vaccines secured from the COVAX facility.“A successful vaccination rollout is crucial to our country’s efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic and support our ultimate goal to protect lives and provide livelihood. The private sector is unwavering in its commitment to assist the national government by providing resources and expertise to ensure the success of its vaccination program,” Joey Concepcion, founder of Go Negosyo and presidential adviser for entrepreneurship, said.Taskforce T3 was formed in April 2020 to work closely with the NTF to manage the outbreak of the pandemic.Last October the group launched the “Ingat Angat Tayong Lahat” campaign, which aimed to build consumer confidence and encourage Filipinos to once again enjoy activities outside the confines of their homes to help rebuild the economy and protect jobs – as long as strict safety guidelines and protocols are followed."

It is unclear if Duterte is willing to get the Chinese-made vaccines.About 500,000 doses of Chinese firm Sinovac’s vaccines are expected to arrive in the Philippines on Feb. 23. The jabs could arrive ahead of the 117,000 doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that the country will initially get under the COVAX Facility of the World Health Organization.Duterte arrived in Davao City over the weekend for a number of engagements. He is staying here also for the birthday of his partner Cielito Avanceña today.The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases also scheduled its weekly meeting at the Arcadia Activity Center last night.Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the President changed his mind about being vaccinated in public to encourage more Filipinos to avail themselves of the vaccination program against the COVID-19 pandemic.At 75, the President belongs to the seniors’ priority group.“He only has to announce when it will be done and that’s of course in recognition of the fact that the people are waiting for a sign whether or not to get themselves vaccinated,” Roque added in mixed English and Filipino.“The President has said, ‘OK, if you want me to,’ and there’s public clamor, he said he will,” the Palace spokesman said. A Pulse Asia poll conducted from Nov. 23 to Dec. 2 last year found 47 percent of Filipinos saying they won’t get COVID-19 jabs mainly because of safety concerns. Only 32 percent of the respondents were willing to be vaccinated while 21 percent were undecided.The President will be vaccinated in public as long as his doctors allow him, Roque said, unlike last month when he said Duterte wanted it done in private.The chief of the Philippine Navy, meanwhile, is also willing to be inoculated in public to show fellow soldiers and everybody else that there is nothing to be concerned about regardless of what vaccine brand will be used.“I am willing to make my inoculation public to allay fears of our countrymen with COVID-19 vaccines,” Vice Admiral Giovanni Carlo Bacordo said. “By making public my vaccination, I believe that I can help the national government build confidence and ease the general public’s hesitancy with COVID-19 vaccines.”“What’s important are its benefits to help mitigate the effect of this pandemic.

Just because they say the vaccine is here, it should not be taken as it can already be purchased and used,” Espina said in a virtual briefing on Friday.She said the FDA is ensuring that the problem created by the Dengvaxia controversy can be avoided.Another HPAAC member, Dr. Leonila Dans, said it’s the vaccine manufacturers that are slow in submitting the requirements and not the FDA.“I think we need to explain that the manufacturers are yet to submit the requirements. It is just in press releases that’s why the people thought the FDA is slow. It’s not,” Dans said.If the manufacturers would not be able to provide the required documents, Dans said their application for EUA will not be approved.Meanwhile, DOH logged an additional 1,928 COVID-19 cases yesterday, bringing the reported total number of cases to 549,176, of which 93.2 percent or 511,743 have survived, including 10,967 newly reported recoveries.Active cases stand at 25,918, accounting for 4.7 percent of total cases. The bulk or 93.1 percent of the active cases are mild and asymptomatic.An additional eight deaths brought to 11,515 the total number of COVID-related deaths. Mortalities account for 2.10 percent of total cases."

Senior citizens, those with preexisting conditions, as well as government employees and state forces are also part of the list.Under the proposed measures, LGUs would be allowed to engage in talks directly with manufacturers and make advanced payments of 50%, but only to those that have secured emergency use approval from local regulators, which to date, would mean Pfizer and AstraZeneca.Such moves came as local chief executives enter into purchase with drugmakers amid criticism on the administration for supposedly being late to entering talks, especially with President Rodrigo Duterte only allowing advanced payments by November 2020.Nearly 30 cities and provinces deals have so far announced agreements or funding for buying the jabs, after being allowed through a tripartite agreement with the national government and vaccine manufacturers.Cua cited the country's restrictive procurement law in backing a proposal by Senate Majority Leader Juan Miguel Zubiri for direct negotiations, saying LGUs only want to help and are only asking for flexibility to better respond to vaccination efforts.He said too that they are ready to communicate to the Senate majority leader to amend the bill and keep the tripartite arrangement.""That's really to give them assurance that LGUs will not go solo,"" Cua said. ""That's not the intent of the bill and if we need to remove..we already expressed it to Sen. Zubiri [that] we're willing to remove that word 'directly' because it creates a lot of confusion.""Doctors Antonio and Leonila Dans of the HPAAC, also guests on ""ViewPoint"" warned that the legislation could ""create more problems with the law than we were trying to solve.""""When you review bills, you need to look not just at its intent but [also] at its unintended consequences,"" said Antonio. ""An unintended effect of direct procurement is loss of health technology expertise in deciding which vaccines to procure.""Both have been in discussions with Zubiri and Cua and were told that the phrase in question would be removed through an amendment. Still, Leonila said it must be reconciled with the version in the House. ""We have to make sure they agree on this common statement, that they will remove the direct purchase with the pharmaceutical company and involve the central government,"" she said.The two stressed the crucial role that local governments will play in the vaccination rollout, which they said would be half of the entire immunization program.This will include hiring and training people for the vaccination as well as ensuring accuracy in LGUs' enrollment list and putting it in a databse.

We thank the British government for its support in our vaccination program, helping vaccinate eight to nine million Filipinos in the first half of 2021,” said vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr.A World Health Organization (WHO) expert panel dismissed concerns over the efficacy of Oxford-AstraZeneca COVID vaccine on Wednesday, insisting that “it’s the right thing to do” to use it – even in countries where new variants had surfaced.WHO chief scientist Dr. Soumya Swaminathan has urged countries to use AstraZeneca vaccine, saying there’s no time for hesitation.Australia has expressed its readiness to support the Philippines and its partners in the Indo-Pacific region to ensure an equitable and efficient distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.Australian Ambassador Steven Robinson said on Twitter that he met recently with Galvez, Health Secretary Francisco Duque III, and National Action Plan deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon to ask for an update on the vaccine rollout.He said Australia also wanted to know from the Philippine officials how it could support the distribution through the COVAX facility.The European Union has also assured the Philippines of “fair access” to affordable COVID-19 vaccines.President Duterte earlier accused the EU of holding up supplies of COVID-19 vaccines to other countries.New Ambassador Luc Véron said the EU is eager to pursue the effective implementation of its Partnership and Cooperation agreement with the Philippines.“The EU and its member states will continue their efforts to contribute to the international response to the pandemic, including by guaranteeing affordable and fair access to vaccines for all,” Véron said following the presentation of his credentials to Duterte on Wednesday.The EU, he said, at all times through its humanitarian aid and civil protection stands prepared to support the Philippines in cases of natural emergencies, and in ensuring disaster preparedness.“For all these reasons, the EU is willing to have a productive political relationship with the Philippine government, notably to support the Philippines in its efforts to overcome the COVID-19 crisis and its efforts to restart its economy,” he added.He noted that the EU has a strategic interest in a stable, prosperous and secure Philippines. This could be achieved by furthering trade and investment, promoting maritime security and maintaining open and safe shipping routes.Since 2014, the EU has been providing the Philippines with preferential trade access to the EU market, based on sustainable development principles, good governance and human rights.“The EU with its business community is also the first foreign investor in the Philippines,” he said.Belgium, for its part, said it will make sure companies that will export COVID-19 vaccine will fulfill their contractual obligations to ensure uninterrupted distribution.“The Belgian Government takes pride in the fact that Belgium is the home of the production facilities of some of the world’s most renowned pharmaceutical companies and will spare no effort to ensure that within the framework of this new procedure, these companies will be able to fulfill their contractual obligations towards third countries and the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines will not be interrupted,” Belgium’s Federal Public Service Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation said.Belgian authorities are in constant communication with suppliers Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson regarding streamlining of procedures.According to the European Commission, the country where the final manufacturing and handling of the vaccine are done before shipment to destination, is responsible for granting export license.“As such, Belgium is responsible for granting export licenses for COVID-19 vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and soon also Johnson & Johnson. Export licenses for exports of vaccines from other suppliers shall be dealt with by other competent EU Member States,” it added."

But definitely, it will be in February,” Galvez said when asked by Sen. Francis Pangilinan on the new dates of vaccine rollout.Sinovac is not a part of the COVAX Facility, a global risk-sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines led by the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, the World Health Organization, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, among others.Galvez said some 600,000 Sinovac Biotech Ltd. coronavirus vaccine doses will arrive this month.“The arrival of the Sinovac might be at the definite date of Feb. 23 because they will include donations for the military and for our health workers,” the vaccine czar added.The finance committee chaired by Sen. Sonny Angara tackled Senate Bill 2042 or Expediting the Purchase and Administration of Vaccines amid the COVID-19 pandemic.Galvez pointed out that the delivery of vaccines is affected by different factors including the approval of EUA as well as supplies.Senate President Pro-Tempore Ralph Recto said a vaccine should not be demonized because of where it was manufactured.“We should not demonize a vaccine because of its country of origin. Let science be the guide, not superstition,” Recto said. “If our scientists from UP (University of the Philippines) and the FDA will say after a thorough evaluation that it is good, then who are we to doubt their findings? Science is the light that will lead us out of pandemic darkness.”“Knee-jerk reaction against anything made in China does not help in the fight against Covid-19. And any doubt on any vaccine in particular fuels vaccine hesitancy in general,” he added.Sen. Imee Marcos said they have been receiving a great number of complaints from Russia’s Gamaleya and Sinopharm, whose vaccines’ EUA are all pending approval.FDA director-general Eric Domingo said the foreign vaccine manufacturers have no local representatives, and there is also a problem with compliance of documents.“This is the mess. We do not know who their local representative is,” Domingo said.HesitancySome police officials are hesitant to be inoculated with coronavirus vaccines from China and will only do so if instructed by the national government.The officers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they will look at the vaccines of other pharmaceutical companies especially if the recipients will be their families.President Duterte wants a portion of the donated COVID-19 vaccines from China’s Sinovac to be allocated to the police and military.One of them, a police official assigned in Camp Crame, said he will pass on China-made vaccines even if he would lose his slot and would rather wait for the brands from other pharmaceutical firms.Asked for the reason, the police officer said he would rather have the medicines from other reputable companies such as Pfizer and Moderna of the United States and British-Swedish company AstraZeneca.Another police official based in Central Luzon, meanwhile, said he will take the made in China vaccine if there is a directive from higher headquarters in Camp Crame.“As police officers, we were instructed to comply first before complaining,” he said in a phone interview.However, the situation is different when it comes to his wife and children, saying he would rather procure vaccines from other companies.This was the same sentiment of a female police commander in Metro Manila, stressing she will never let her children take the Sinovac vaccine CoronaVac.A police general, however, said he is willing to be inoculated with the vaccine from China despite his apprehension, adding it is better to take the risk than not getting vaccinated at all.Philippine National Police PNP) chief Gen. Debold Sinas refused to comment when asked if he is willing to be inoculated with the vaccine from Sinovac.Sinas did not reply when asked if he would prefer to be vaccinated in public to boost the government’s campaign to convince people to get the jabs purchased by the national government.Meanwhile, the delivery of 117,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine from the World Health Organization’s COVAX facility has apparently hit a snag.National Task Force deputy chief Vince Dizon said in a Palace briefing that there are some delays in the vaccine arrival from the COVAX facility due to documentary issues.But Dizon said he remains optimistic the delivery will be made within the month.Allergic reactionsMedical experts yesterday warned against getting second dose of COVID vaccine for those who would suffer from allergic reactions in the initial shot.The Philippine Society of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (PSSAAI), however, maintained that there is no reason for the public to worry and that COVID vaccine is safe to most people.The PSSAAI noted that the risk of getting COVID infection is higher than the risk of suffering from allergic reaction from vaccination.“Severe allergic reaction is rare and the usual mild allergic reaction such as rashes, itchiness, running nose and sneezing can be managed with antihistamine,” immunology and allergy doctor Maria Carmen Ang said in a virtual briefing yesterday.Ang said vaccines may cause side effects to a person, but not all of them are allergic reactions.“Some side effects are reactogenic and it is not the same as allergic,” she said, and that among the local or reactogenic reactions are pain, swelling and redness in the injection.She said those mild reactions, including vomiting, headache, muscle pain and fever, would go away within three days and can be managed with pain reliever.Only those who would have immediate allergic reaction such as anaphylaxis and those with allergy to the components of vaccine are strongly advised against getting vaccinated, she said.“The only contraindication are for patients with immediate allergic reaction whether mild or severe after the first dose should not receive the second dose and those with history of any component of the vaccine should not receive as well,” Ang stressed.She said those with allergy to food and other allergens as well as those with asthma, allergic rhinitis can still receive the vaccine.PSSAAI president Rommel Lobo said there has been no confirmed death related to COVID vaccine.Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said the added protection of COVID-19 vaccine will bring the Philippines one step closer to resuming a more normal life. – Emmanuel Tupas, Christina Mendez, Mayen Jaymalin"

It’s very important that you have a portfolio of three or four different vaccines and to really work with several manufacturers,” Dmitriev told The Chiefs on Cignal TV’s One News on Tuesday night.Russian Direct Investment Fund bankrolled the development of Sputnik V vaccine which, Dmitriev said, has already been granted EUA by 22 countries.“The Philippines deserves to get a portfolio of different vaccines and Sputnik V should be one of these because it is one of the best vaccines,” he said, adding it is important for people to choose the kind of COVID-19 vaccines they will take.Russia, he said, is ready to provide vaccines for 700 million people around the world this year.“We are happy to start supplying to the Philippines as soon as we get an approval here,” Dmitriev said. “We will supply any volume that the Philippines need for over six to seven months.”Meanwhile, a health social scientist believes there is a need to educate people more about the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines to encourage them to get immunized.Professor Nina Castillo-Carandang said the number of medical workers “highly likely” to get COVID-19 vaccine increased after town hall meetings were held with them.“We have to conclude from here that more information is needed even for those who are supposed to be more familiar with health concerns such as vaccine,” Carandang also told The Chiefs."

Ports have already activated one-stop shops to handle vaccine shipments,” Guerrero said when asked if the BOC is prepared to accept COVID-19 vaccines. “We will use pre-arrival clearance procedures for COVID-19 vaccine shipments so that they can be expeditiously released upon arrival at the airport.”The BOC acknowledges the importance to swiftly release the vaccines so that their efficacy will not be affected, according to Guerrero.The BOC and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) conducted a dry run last Tuesday to practice how to process the vaccines.Guerrero said the simulation exercise went smoothly: “It went very well. Customs clearance was very fast as the shipment was already processed prior to its arrival.”Asked if they have received information on the arrival of the vaccines, the BOC commissioner said they do not know yet, but he assured the public that the bureau is ready once they arrive.Guerrero also emphasized that BOC personnel would not be allowed to physically handle the vaccines.‘Secure, escort vaccines’From arrival to delivery to actual inoculation, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) has ordered the Philippine National Police (PNP) to secure and escort COVID-19 vaccines in the country to their intended destinations for rollout.DILG officer-in-charge Undersecretary Bernardo Florece said police should be present and coordinate with local government units (LGUs) to secure and protect the vaccines during transport and administration.“We direct the PNP to be in close coordination with LGUs so that these vaccines are secured and protected. From their arrival at the airport to inoculation, our police force will be there,” Florece said in a statement in mixed English and Filipino.Being part of the Task Group Supply Chain and Logistics, the PNP will be present to secure and protect the vaccines and the team that will be administering the inoculation.Aside from police, local officials such as barangay captains, local safety officers and barangay tanods should aid in the vaccination, according to Florece.“Like what we’ve always been reminding, we need all the help that we can get in this pandemic, especially in the vaccine rollout in the country, that’s why the PNP, together with barangay chiefs and tanods, is expected to assist and cooperate,” he said.The national government is looking at commencing the massive COVID-19 vaccination drive by next week, starting with frontline health care workers.An initial batch of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are expected to be rolled out by Monday.As this developed, the DILG criticized the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) for laying down conditions before they can grant President Duterte’s request to not hamper the delivery of COVID-19 vaccines nationwide.The CPP had earlier said it would provide a “humanitarian corridor,” but the government should refrain from using military vehicles in transporting the vaccines and that these vehicles should be properly marked.DILG spokesman Undersecretary Jonathan Malaya said the CPP is threatening the delivery of vaccines in conflict-affected areas by laying down demands on the government.Malaya added the PNP is on high alert because of the conditions set by the communist group.‘Caduceus’All security measures are in place to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines, the PNP said yesterday.“All systems are in place to ensure the unhampered transport of the vaccine shipment to storage facilities and distribution hubs,” PNP chief Gen. Debold Sinas said in a statement.Sinas said they have drawn up a strategic plan that will operationalize all security and public safety operations for the transport of vaccines in the coming weeks and months.Under the PNP’s Vaccination Plan “Caduceus,” police have put in place security and public safety guidelines as well as procedures in support of the national government’s vaccination program.PNP deputy chief for operations Lt. Gen. Cesar Binag, overall supervisor of the security program, said police regional officers will provide security assistance in the transport of vaccine shipments from storage hubs to vaccination centers.The PNP will also establish police assistance at vaccination centers to deter rebel groups such as the New People’s Army from carrying out attacks.At least 2,705 members of the PNP’s medical reserve force will also help health care workers in administering the vaccines to designated recipients.Binag said police units across the country have mapped out their respective security plans so that COVID-19 vaccines purchased by the national government will reach their intended recipients.He added that local police units have conducted simulation drills for the transportation of the vaccines from the airport and seaports to designated cold storage facilities.Backup plans have also been formulated in the event that delivery trucks get stalled or meet an accident, according to the police official, explaining that this is necessary so that the vaccines are kept safe and transported immediately to storage areas.The PNP has also identified areas where the presence of communist rebels and other armed groups are located, but Binag declined to give details.He said they patterned their security measures on preparations they laid out during previous elections in the country, where vote counting machines are transported immediately and heavily secured at storage areas.6 challengesMeanwhile, the Department of Health (DOH) is looking at six challenges that must be hurdled to ensure the smooth implementation of the country’s COVID-19 vaccination program.At a press briefing yesterday, DOH Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said last Tuesday’s simulation exercise to rehearse vaccine deployment “went well, in general.”Vergeire, however, noted that there are still “challenges” to be encountered when vaccination is actually being rolled out.The first concern, according to the DOH official, is “vaccine wastage,” given the importance of the vaccines.“The challenge for us would be (to) ensure that there will be no vaccine wastage, that no dose will be wasted. We are putting some safeguards to prevent this from happening,” she said.The DOH is also worried about “vaccine confidence” as there are studies that 45 percent of Filipinos are not willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19, although the government is addressing this by having alternative vaccinees in each vaccination site.Another challenge, according to Vergeire, is to keep the public observing health protocols after being vaccinated.“We all know that the vaccines do not have the capacity to block transmission. Meaning, even if you are vaccinated, you can still be infected and you can still transmit this virus,” she said, adding that the vaccines only provide “lesser chances of severe hospitalization,” among others.The fourth challenge is the vaccine brand or the various “platforms” of the vaccines that are available now.“People should have a choice, but we can’t give them the choice right now because of global shortage. So that’s a challenge for us on how we can convince them that even if their choice is B, but A is the one available, they should accept it already,” Vergeire said.The DOH is also considering “cold chain and logistics” as another issue in COVID-19 vaccination, expecting that the distribution and transportation of the vaccines in the provinces to be more challenging compared with those in Metro Manila.“The last (challenge) is monitoring the adverse events. We have to monitor recipients not only for days but for a long period of time for adverse reactions,” Vergeire said.56,000 medical frontlinersAround 56,000 medical frontliners and hospital staff in COVID-19 referral hospitals will be the first in line to get vaccinated with the 117,000 Pfizer-BioNTech doses that will be supplied through the COVAX facility and will arrive in the country this month.The government has started processing recipients of the vaccines in four referral hospitals in Metro Manila for the first tranche of inoculations, according to Presidential Communications Operations Office Secretary Martin Andanar. These are the Philippine General Hospital in Manila, Lung Center of the Philippines and East Avenue Medical Center in Quezon City and Dr. Jose Natalio Rodriguez Memorial Medical Center (Tala Hospital) in Caloocan City.“As we move forward this 2021, the government is set to roll out the national COVID-19 vaccination program this month with an initial target of 56,000 health care workers in four referral hospitals in Metro Manila. Next in line will be health care workers in other COVID-19 referral hospitals in Metro Manila, Cebu City and Davao City,” Andanar said during the Pagdu-aw sa Butuan City: Explain, Explain, Explain Town Hall Meeting last Tuesday. – Romina Cabrera, Emmanuel Tupas, Sheila Crisostomo, ChristinaMendez"

There were some minor kinks that we observed based on the agreed protocol and what happen. But these were correctible ones that’s why the exercise was fruitful so that the minor details of the plan that was omitted shall have been addressed and shall be corrected as it comes in the actual transport of the vaccines,” Bernadas said during a virtual media forum yesterday.Bernadas added that the exercise was meant to orient their partners, the media and the public on how the national government and the recipient regional offices and the recipient hospital response to the transport of the vaccines which the time element of which is very much critical in the handling and distribution of the vaccines.The DOH-7 chief said that regional vaccination program is patterned after the national government vaccination plan which  targets 100 percent of the population but the initial 35 percent  will be the frontliners, the senior citizens, indigent population and the rest of government as frontliners and their partners in the hospital and in the private sector.Bernadas said that 585 vials times 5 doses or around 1,900 doses will arrive in Cebu (for VSMMC frontliners and employees only) between February 12 to 15 as initial share of Cebu out of the first batch of 114,000 doses to arrive in the country.‘Get vaccinated’As the country gears up the vaccine rollout next week, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) ordered yesterday the Philippine National Police (PNP) to treat and secure vaccines as gold.“Ang mga bakuna na ‘yan ay parang ginto lalo na ngayong kulang pa ang supply kaya pinaghahanda natin ang PNP sa anumang insidente,” said DILG Officer-in-Charge (OIC) and Undersecretary Bernardo  Florece Jr.More than a historical milestone, the national vaccination program aims to save lives and is expected to put an end to this pandemic, Florece said.As such, the DILG has directed the PNP to be in close coordination with the LGUs so that these vaccines are secured and protected.“Pagdating sa airport hanggang sa maiturok ang mga ito, kasama na ang ating kapulisan,” said Florece.The National Task Force COVID-19 aims to inoculate first the healthcare sector’s 1.4 million individuals.Florece said that as a member of the Task Group Supply Chain and Logistics, the PNP is expected to be a constant presence in accordance with the national government’s vaccination plan, primarily to secure and protect the COVID-19 vaccines and the team that will be administering them.According to the Philippine National Deployment and Vaccination Plan, local officials such as barangay captains and barangay safety officers, including the barangay tanods, are also expected to aid in the vaccination.“Tulad ng lagi nating paalala, we need all the help that we can get sa pandemyang ito lalo na sa nalalapit na pagbabakuna sa ating bansa kaya ang ating PNP, kasama ang mga pinuno ng barangay at mga tanod, ay inaasahan nating makikipagtulungan at makikiisa,” Florece said. — Caecent No-ot Magsumbol, JMD (FREEMAN)"

Rounded up, that brings 19.4% approved and 6.0% strongly approved.The Philippines has remained the region's second-worst hit by the pandemic. Its neighbor Indonesia which has the highest number of cases at 1.17 million and nearly 32,000 deaths, yielded a 50.4% disapproval against 24.1% approved and 25.6% neutral.In contrast, Vietnam had the highest approval rating among its more specialized citizens at 96.6%, followed by Brunei at 93.9% and Singapore at 92.4%.Hanoi and the city-state of Singapore had both earned praise for their coronavirus response, with only 2,070 cases and 35 deaths for the former and with 59,747 infections and 29 fatalities, according to the Johns Hopkins University and Medicine.Bandar Seri Begawan, meanwhile, had so far reported a slim 182 cases and three deaths.In the early stages of the pandemic in Southeast Asia, Singapore was actually close to Jakarta in the highest cases, with Manila then at third. But with authorities managing to keep it at nearly 60,000 at present, it seems that its handling has worked better than that of the two other countries.The study had 1,032 specialized respondents from ten ASEAN member states with 6.5% coming from the Philippines, and was held from Nov. 18, 2020 to Jan. 10, 2021. Its margin of error was not stated.Most of those who took part in it were from the academe, think tanks or research institutions at 45.4%, those from government at 30.7%, civil society, non-government organizations or media at 9.3%, business or finance at 9.2% and regional or international organizations at 5.3%.Those between 21 to 35 years old made up most of the participants at 34.9%, individuals between 36 to 45 at 30.6%, those 46 to 60 at 23%, those above 60 at 9.3% and those under 21 at a measly 2.2%.Where to improve?An overwhelming majority of 72.2% from the country said there is a need to encourage more science and health experts ""to contribute to public policy discussions"" and for government to heed their advice.Such an observation bears more weight especially since the Duterte administration has long been criticized for its militaristic approach to a health crisis, with the president putting retired military officials to lead the coronavirus task force, as well as deploying cops and soldiers to carry out pandemic-related curbs.RELATED: 'Medical quarantine, not ECQ': Health professionals call for change in 'militaristic' lockdownsSome 58.3% said the government should invest in early warning systems for future pandemic outbreaks, as well as for research and development for testing and vaccine development. Officials have sought to claim that the administration had prioritized improving the country's testing capacity since the start of the pandemic, but the previous months have showed that screening efforts are still largely carried out by private-run laboratories.But a lesson it has learned to carry out was establishing a virology research institute under the science and technology department, with a P284 million ($5.9 million) funding for this year.Further in the report, 33.3% said better financial relief and subsidies should be offered to the millions economically affected by the pandemic. Some 30.6%, meanwhile, said officials should lead in following health protocols instead of flouting them, as is shown in a series of documented incidents by no less than the president's men and some lawmakers, and 5.6% said the measures should be better implemented in public.RELATED: Whatever happened to: Quarantine violators in Philippine government""These findings confirm that while ASEAN member governments have done relatively well in their public health response, they will need to do more to be better prepared in the long-term for future outbreaks,"" the report said.Leadership, challenges in the pandemicIn total, 32.7% of the respondents said Singapore had provided the best leadership in the region during the course of the health crisis, followed by Vietnam at 31.1%.Only 0.5% of all participants picked the Philippines for the said criteria, the lowest, with 6% being Filipinos and 0.6% from Myanmar.The pandemic has also emerged as the top challenge respondents believe Southeast Asia is facing, followed by unemployment and economic recession and socio-economic gaps and rising income disparity.For Filipinos, 80.6% agreed that the COVID-19 is the Number 1 challenge, followed by ""more intense and frequent weather events"" as a result of climate change at 59.7%, unemployment and the recession at 65.7%, along with increased military tensions such as in the South China Sea at 37.3% and 28.4% on widening socio-econimic gaps.Only 3% of them answered terrorism, 11.9% on domestic political instability and 13.4% on the deterioration of human rights conditions.""While it is not meant to present the definitive Southeast Asian view of current affairs, the survey acts as a barometer of the general attitudes and perceptions of interested stakeholders on important regional developments,"" the report added.In January, an assessment by another independent think tank placed the Philippines at 79th place globally out of almost 100 nations in handling the coronavirus pandemic, making it one of the ""underperformers"" in Asia Pacific.While health officials have said that they welcome such researchers on the health crisis, they said that the study had failed to grasp ""the complex nature of pandemic response,"" and adding that ""we can't be comparing apples to oranges.""The Philippines is nearing a year into its community quarantine first set in March 2020 to become the world's longest.

""'Pag sinabi nating indicative, 'yan po 'yung mga tentative schedule pa lang. Wala pa po tayong confirmed dates.""(When we say indicative, those are still tentative schedules so far. We don't have confirmed dates yet.)Still, the senior health official said inoculation would begin two to three days once the doses are delivered, with health workers first to receive the vaccines under government's priority list. According to vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr., doses from the COVAX facility would include millions from AstraZeneca and some 117,000 from Pfizer, candidate vaccines which have been cleared for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration.Officials also held a simulation exercise on Tuesday for the jabs' arrival in a bid to show readiness in undertaking a giant effort of vaccination 50 to 70 million in 2021 alone.Commenting on the move, Vergeire said they encountered ""bottlenecks"", which she said they had already expected and eventually resolved. ""Yesterday, the simulation was ongoing and transport vehicles were passing through [South Luzon Expressway], and [noong] papunta na sa [Research Institute for Tropical Medicine], biglang mayroong aksidenteng malaki so the transport vehicles had to go through another route,"" she said.(As the transport vehicles were passing there was a huge accident so they had to go throug another route.)President Rodrigo Duterte had significantly pinned his hopes on the vaccines over the course of the health crisis, but his administration has faced criticisms in the bid to secure doses, particularly that it was late into engaging in talks with drugmakers as well as its preference for the Chinese-made Sinovac."

For example, if 800 people are scheduled to be inoculated on the day of vaccination, there should be 160 back up vaccine recipients who can be contacted in case people back out or miss their appointment.  “We don’t have a basis for the 20%. We just want to be sure that if we have those who refuse on the day of vaccination, at least we have this reserve of 20%,” Vergeire said.The guidelines of the quick substitution list are still being finalized but the health official said it must include those in the priority sectors.The government faces the challenge of conducting a massive COVID-19 vaccination program, which relies heavily on public trust that vaccines are both effective and safe following the highly politicized Dengvaxia controversy in 2017.Almost half of Filipinos were not inclined to get vaccinated against COVID-19 mainly due to safety concerns, a survey released by Pulse Asia in January suggested. Only 32% of the 2,400 adult respondents said their will get COVID-19 jabs, while the remaining 21% were undecided.A separate Social Weather Stations survey released last year showed that 66% of adult Filipinos were willing to receive COVID-19 jabs, while 31% were not.The government is aiming to secure a total of 146 to 148 vaccine doses to inoculate at least 50 million people this year alone but it has yet to execute definitive supply agreements with pharmaceutical companies.  Officials are anticipating the arrival of an initial batch of 117,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine obtained through the COVAX facility this month.

I am glad that the City Council will also take part together with the vice mayor, with the executive, the vaccine board in implementing the vaccination program,” he added.Labella said the implementation of the vaccination program is a “big challenge” and is something that everyone in the city government must work for together.After an exchange of strong statements on Facebook last weekend, Labella assured that he and Rama are in good terms.“We are in good terms. As I've said, we are like brothers. We have gone a long way together and and it's not that easy for us to go separate ways... We cannot just untie the bonds that we have,” he said.Labella, in his post Saturday, told Rama to set aside politics saying he has been productive more than ever even while working from home.The day after, Rama denied “playing politics,” saying he was instead promoting the interests of Cebuanos during this pandemic when he said Labella knew what to do if he could not manage the City Hall affairs.Labella is still overseeing the city from home per his doctor’s advice.In an interview on The Freeman Conversations, Rama also said he and the mayor will always stay as friends.“Between me and Mayor Edgardo Colina Labella, being friends, that will always stay. Being a party mate, that will continue to stay, that is very clear,” Rama said.Rama said he was able to talk to Labella Monday at the right time when his temper has subsided.“He called me this morning (Monday morning).

It’s good as it gives us a way of preparing for the actual delivery of the vaccines, receiving it and it’s transfer to the cold chain storage,” said Dr. Mary Jean Loreche, DOH-7 spokesperson, when asked of her assessment of the exercise.A press conference is set today to announce the details of their assessment.Loreche said they are expecting 2,900 vaccines to arrive on February 12, 2021 for the healthcare workers at VSMMC. The hospital has a total of 2,987 healthcare workers but only 2,480 have confirmed for vaccination.In a statement released by the Philippine Information Agency-7, DOH-7 regional director Dr. Jaime Bernadas said they are expecting an initial delivery of at least 20,000 doses out of the 100,000 COVID-19 vaccines allocated for Cebu, one of the priority areas for the vaccine rollout in the country. Bernadas said the cold chain storage facility at VSMMC has a capacity of 400,000.Another simulation exercise is scheduled on February 11, 2021 for vaccinators at VSMMC. Bernadas said that simulation exercises are part of the preparations for the rollout of the vaccines from the national hub to the regional hub. — FPL (FREEMAN)"

Allow the vaccines to be transported freely and safely... Kindly observe the rules of humanity,” he added.The Chief Executive reminded the communists that the vaccines were bought using public funds and therefore belong to the Filipino people.“The Communist Party of the Philippines must guarantee that the vaccines, in the course of their being transported to areas where (there) are no city health officers or medical persons… They should not touch the medicines,” Duterte said.The government is expecting delivery of the first batch of COVID-19 jabs in the middle of this month.Duterte also ordered the Bureau of Customs to ensure the unhampered arrival of the vaccines, noting that the shots have to be placed in storage facilities as soon as possible to prevent spoilage.“Do not delay and do not hinder or obstruct the smooth flow that you are seeing right now, from the time of the arrival to the time of clearance... Your job in customs is to look (at the shipments). You have no business opening them. You are not allowed to do that. I am not allowing anybody there in the airport to open,” he said.The President said the police should provide escorts to ensure that the vaccines would be transported to local governments in the fastest way possible.He also suggested the use of public school buildings as vaccination sites, saying military and police installations may not be enough to accommodate all vaccinees.“If there is no large coliseum or gym, then we will utilize the schools... I do not see any objectionable thing there,” he said.National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer and vaccine czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said the government’s pandemic task force has coordinated with various agencies to ensure the smooth arrival and delivery of vaccines. Galvez added that Customs processing of the vaccines would not take more than 30 minutes.‘Humanitarian corridor’In response, the CPP vowed that its armed wing, the New People’s Army (NPA), would not mount attacks against the transport of COVID-19 vaccines.CPP information officer Marco Valbuena said they would ensure that transportation of COVID-19 vaccines “will be provided a humanitarian corridor for safe and unimpeded passage in guerrilla bases and zones.”“It is a matter of principle for the NPA to respect all humanitarian undertakings that benefit the masses,” Valbuena added.The CPP officer, however, dissuaded the government from transporting the vaccines on military vehicles, especially those which are not properly marked and carrying armed soldiers.“Over the past year, the (Armed Forces of the Philippines) has been carrying out combat and psywar operations behind the veil of implementing COVID-19 restrictions,” Valbuena said.“Using the AFP to transport vaccines will not encourage people to be vaccinated, especially in many areas in the countryside, where people are traumatized by military garrisoning of their communities and helicopter gunships firing missiles,” he added.The CPP further claimed that even now, peasant masses are worried that the AFP might use the vaccination drive for counterinsurgency and demand “surrender before vaccine.”Instead, the CPP suggested that the transportation, distribution and inoculation drive of COVID-19 vaccines, especially in interior areas, “be handled by the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Philippine Red Cross and other civilian humanitarian agencies whose personnel are properly trained and who have the facilities to undertake such missions.”“Non-Red Cross vehicles that will be used as COVID-19 vaccine transporters must be clearly and properly marked with a red cross over white background,” the CPP said. – Artemio Dumlao, Edith Regalado"

As you know, many businesses, especially small and medium enterprises, are now announcing closures and the unemployment rate is increasing,” it added.The PRA emphasized that the local retail industry is among those still struggling with the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.“The survival of our businesses – and the future of retailers in the country – is at stake. Please help us retailers survive, so we may continue to prosper with the nation after all these challenges,” it said.The PRA is composed of over 400 member-companies, including retailers, mall and shopping center operators, traders or suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and wholesalers.Earlier this month, the government announced the priority sectors for the COVID-19 vaccination program: A1 or frontline workers in health facilities both national and local, private and public, health professionals and non-professionals like students, nursing aides, janitors and barangay health workers; A2 or senior citizens aged 60 and above; and A3 or persons with comorbidities not included in the preceding categories.Those in A4 are uniformed personnel and working in sectors identified by the IATF as essential during the enhanced community quarantine; while A5 covers indigent population not included in the preceding categories.B1 covers teachers and social workers; B2 refers to other government workers; and B3 are other essential workers.B4 refers to socio-demographic groups at significantly higher risk other than senior citizens and indigenous people; B5 covers overseas Filipino workers; while those in B6 are the remaining work force."
