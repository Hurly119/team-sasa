      "\"Today is a major first step towards realizing our shared vision of vaccine equity, but it's just the beginning,\" he added.\n",
      "\"We still have a lot of work to do with governments and manufacturers to ensure that vaccination of health workers and older people is underway in all countries within the first 100 days of this year,\" he said in a statement issued by GAVI, the global health alliance working to increase immunization in developing nations.\n",
      "The UK's foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, described Wednesday's rollout as a \"huge step forward in ending this pandemic.\"\n",

      "(CNN) — Pfizer's encouraging news about the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccine came nearly a week after Election Day. But Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla says the timing had nothing to do with politics.\n",
      "In an interview with CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, Bourla said he first learned about the results of the trial Sunday and he has yet to see the data, throwing cold water on the idea that there was any political motivation behind releasing the news after voters in the United States chose their candidate for president.\n",
      "Pfizer took several interim looks at the data during its vaccine trial, but it did not have enough infections in its test group to gain any meaningful data — until Sunday, Gupta reported. If anything, the data came earlier than expected: In October, Bourla made a comment  in an open letter on Pfizer's website, saying, \"Based on our current trial enrollment and dosing pace, we estimate we will reach this milestone in the third week of November.\"\n",
      "The Trump administration was quick to take credit for Pfizer's promising news. US Vice President Mike Pence tweeted that Pfizer's development was \"thanks to the public-private partnership forged by President Donald Trump.\"\n",
      "US President Trump, however, lashed out at Pfizer and the FDA over the drug company's announcement.\n",
      "\"As I have long said, @Pfizer and the others would only announce a Vaccine after the Election, because they didn't have the courage to do it before,\" Trump tweeted Monday evening. \"Likewise, the @US_FDA should have announced it earlier, not for political purposes, but for saving lives!\" he tweeted.\n",

      "The US federal government promised $1.95 billion to Pfizer (PFE) and partner BioNTech (BNTX) to assist with the distribution of the vaccine once it's ready — but the government is not directly working to help its development.\n",
      "Trump had called drug companies, pressuring them for new developments before Election Day. He explicitly told the companies' CEOs that he'd like to see a vaccine move quicker than some of his health advisers said was reasonable, CNN has reported.\n",
      "On Monday morning, President-elect Joe Biden issued a statement welcoming the \"excellent news\" and congratulating the \"brilliant women and men who helped produce this breakthrough.\"\n",
      "He added that \"it is also important to understand that the end of the battle against COVID-19 is still months away\" and \"it will be many more months before there is a widespread vaccination\" in the United States.\n",
      "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Pfizer's vaccine news bodes well for other COVID-19 vaccines in development and added that Pfizer was able to get results quickly due to the severity of the pandemic.\n",
      "Although the vaccine is not set to be widely administered soon, Pfizer said it plans to seek emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration soon after volunteers have been monitored for two months following their second dose of the vaccine.\n",
      "Pfizer has at least three vaccine manufacturing sites in the United States, Gupta said. At the Kalamazoo, Michigan, facility, there are several refrigerators — that span about the length of a football field — that are used to store the vaccine.\n",
      "For months companies have been racing to develop, and eventually distribute, an effective coronavirus vaccine. The race shows no signs of slowing as companies continue to move their vaccine candidates through clinical trials, growing closer to determining which will be considered safe and effective.\n",
      "Vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna utilize new technology that has never been used in vaccines before, and experts say that in itself is a reason to be cautious.\n",

      "Published Dec 7, 2020 6:19:45 PM\n",
      "(CNN) -- Britain's healthcare providers are gearing up to start giving the first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, less than a week after the United Kingdom became the first Western nation to approve a Covid-19 vaccine.\n",
      "Vaccinations are set to begin on Tuesday in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland said it would start administering the vaccine early in the week but did not specify which day.\n",
      "The process, which is complicated by the need to store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine under strict conditions and give each recipient two doses, three weeks apart, will be closely watched from around the world.\n",
      "Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News on Sunday that 50 hospital hubs across England had already received their allocation of the vaccine, and that the distribution of the vaccine was \"really well underway now.\"\n",
      "UK health officials expect to have up to 4 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19, available by the end of December, Cordery said.\n",
      "The government has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine so far, enough to vaccinate 20 million people, or a third of the UK population. More deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded in the UK than anywhere else in Europe.\n",
      "The speed with which UK regulators approved the vaccine -- ahead of their counterparts elsewhere in Europe and in the United States -- raised questions in some quarters. But Cordery said the process had been \"incredibly robust.\"\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "\"Yes, it has been shorter than other vaccine approval processes, but that's because everything all has been thrown at this all in one go,\" she said.\n",
      "The head of the UK medicines regulator also put out assurances on Sunday, saying the Pfizer/BioNTech jab is \"as safe as any general vaccine\" and that those receiving it would be monitored by health officials.\n",
      "\"You might have a mild symptom but it will probably disappear in a day or two, and nothing at all of a serious nature,\" June Raine, head of the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), told the BBC.\n",
      "According to the MHRA, more than one in 10 recipients may suffer side effects including pain at the injection site, headache, muscle pain, chills, joint pain and fever. A handful of other, less common, side effects are also listed.\n",
      "Asked about the potential impact of Brexit on the vaccination program, Raine said: \"We've practiced, we are ready and we are fully prepared for any possible outcome.\"\n",
      "The transition period for the UK's exit from the European Union comes to an end on December 31. Last-ditch talks between EU and UK leaders on a trade deal continued over the weekend, amid dire warnings over the economic and logistic chaos that would result from a hard crash out of the world's largest trading bloc.\n",
      "\"Our goal at the HMRA is to make sure that whatever the outcome, whatever the deal, medicines, medical devices, and vaccines reach everyone in all parts of the country in the same way without any interruption at all,\" Raine said.\n",
      "The first doses of the vaccine reportedly arrived in the UK on Thursday night, carried by a fleet of unmarked trucks through the Eurotunnel from Belgium to undisclosed storage facilities in England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, according to CNN affiliate ITV News.\n",
      "The UK government's announcement of its approval a day earlier had been followed by confusion over who would get the vaccine first and how it could be administered safely, given the logistical constraints.\n",
      "The vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, a temperature only possible in special freezers. Once taken out of the freezer, the MHRA authorization requires the doses to be kept refrigerated and used within 5 days. Batches can only be moved and repacked into smaller numbers of doses a limited number of times and under strict conditions. Once a vial is diluted for injection, it cannot be transported and must be used within six hours, or discarded.\n",
      "The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended vaccinating residents of care homes for older adults and their staff first, followed by people aged over 80 as well as health and care workers.\n",
      "But the challenges involved in getting the vaccine to care home residents means health workers now plan to administer it first to people aged over 80 who are about to be discharged from hospital, or are attending out-patient hospital appointments.\n",
      "\"Hospitals will also begin inviting over 80s in for a jab and work with care home providers to book their staff in to vaccination clinics,\" a statement from NHS England said Sunday. \"Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from Covid.\"\n",
      "Raine told the BBC the exact timing might be \"variable\" but that she expected to see the vaccine reach care homes \"definitely within the next two weeks.\"\n",
      "Northern Ireland's Health Ministry said Friday an initial consignment of almost 25,000 doses had arrived, paving the way for \"vaccinations to commence from early next week, starting with vaccinator teams.\"\n",
      "Scotland is set to receive 65,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from the initial batch of 800,000 doses distributed in the UK, Secretary of State for Scotland Alister Jack said in an op-ed for the Mail on Sunday.\n",
      "He added that the Armed Forces were involved in the planning and logistics of the vaccination program.\n",
      "Scottish Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said those giving the vaccinations would be the first to receive it, followed by care home residents and staff, then all those 80 years of age and over and front line health and social care workers.\n",
      "She acknowledged the challenges around transporting the vaccine to care homes and individual residences, but added: \"For all the difficulties that lie ahead, it should give us all real hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight.\"\n",
      "Other nations are not far behind the UK when it comes to taking a decision on approving the vaccine.\n",
      "The US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has scheduled a meeting of its vaccine advisory committee December 10 to discuss Pfizer/BioNTech's emergency authorization application. It will meet again on December 17 to consider the application for Moderna's vaccine candidate.\n",
      "Dr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, apologized Thursday after suggesting a day earlier that UK regulators had not scrutinized the data on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as carefully as their US counterparts.\n",
      "News of the approval of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was welcomed by many Britons as a ray of light at the end of a dark year.\n",
      "There are hopes that UK approval could soon follow for Moderna and the vaccine candidate developed by British-Swedish drugmaker AstraZeneca and Oxford University.\n",
      "But the four chief medical officers for the United Kingdom warned in a letter that this winter would still be \"especially hard\" and that people must not let down their guard against the virus.\n",
      "\"Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months,\" they said.\n",
      "Meanwhile, vaccination centers across Moscow started to distribute Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine on Saturday, initially to groups such as teachers, health professionals, and municipal services workers.\n",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered large-scale vaccination with Sputnik V to begin across the country from this week.\n",
      "Russia became the first country in the world to approve its coronavirus vaccine in August, authorizing the treatment for public use even before crucial Phase 3 trials -- which are still underway -- were conducted. The move drew criticism from scientific circles.\n",
      "\"Civil vaccination has started at 70 points in Moscow today. We work from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., seven days a week,\" Natalya Nikolaevna Kuzenkova, chief doctor of Moscow's Hospital 68, told CNN on Saturday.\n",
      "Kuzenkova shrugged off questions about vaccine safety. \"If there is a question between getting sick or getting a vaccine ... this is a very dangerous disease which leads to quite serious consequences. So the answer is obvious here,\" she said.\n",
      "\"The vaccine has officially been registered. Two stages of clinical trials have passed and we are now completing the third stage. Therefore, within the framework of a pandemic, in these conditions, this does not at all contradict any regulatory norms,\" she added.\n",
      "Mayor of Moscow Sergei Sobyanin suggested early participation was enthusiastic, saying more than 5,000 people had registered for vaccination in the first five hours.\n",
      "One of those getting vaccinated Saturday told CNN she was \"not at this point\" afraid of having the vaccine before trials are over.\n",
      "\"Well, of course there are some concerns. But I try not to think about it,\" said the woman, who works as an administrator at the hospital and identified herself only as Nadezhda. \"I wanted to get immunity from the new Covid-19 infection. Protect myself and my family. In order not to get sick, not to get complications, not to infect my loved ones.\"\n",
      "Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said last week that more than 100,000 Russian citizens had already had the Sputnik V vaccine.\n",
      "Officials say there are enough doses for more than 2 million people across Russia, which has a population of about 145 million.\n",

      "By Nectar Gan and Tatiana Arias, CNN\n",
      "Published Jan 13, 2021 7:18:42 PM\n",
      "(CNN) -- A leading Chinese Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech was just 50.38% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil, significantly lower than earlier results showed, according to a statement published by the government of Sao Paulo Tuesday.\n",
      "While the number exceeds the threshold required for regulatory approval, it falls far below the 78% previously announced, raising questions as to the veracity of the data and fueling skepticism over the apparent lack of transparency regarding Chinese vaccines.\n",
      "Analysts said the efficacy rate of Sinovac's Coronavac vaccine in Brazil -- the lowest among its global competitors -- could affect international confidence in Chinese-made vaccines and hamper Beijing's effort to repair its image from its early mishandling of the initial outbreak by providing Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries.\n",
      "\"The Butantan Institute and the Government of Sao Paulo report that the coronavirus vaccine achieved a 50.38% overall efficacy rate in the clinical study conducted in Brazil, in addition to (an efficacy rate of) 78% for mild cases and 100% for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19. All rates are higher than the 50% level required by the WHO (World Health Organization),\" the statement released Tuesday said.\n",
      "The razor-thin margin for regulatory approval is likely to lead to concern among scientists, given that last week the Butantan institute released partial \"clinical efficacy\" results celebrating 78% to 100% efficacy in preventing infections.\n",
      "The state body financed the phase 3 trials of the vaccine, which involved 13,000 health workers across eight Brazilian states.\n",
      "\"Regarding the overall efficacy of the analysis, we met the requirements of the World Health Organization with 50.38%,\" Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at the Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo said Tuesday during a news conference.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "However, on Tuesday, high-ranking members of the Brazilian Health Ministry told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil that \"the effectiveness is borderline,\" and that because \"It is at the limit. We have to wait for ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) to evaluate.\"\n",
      "A representative of Sinovac said the company is discussing the result but declined to give further comment. The final efficacy rate of the vaccine will be determined by China's drug regulator, the National Medical Production Administration, according to the representative.\n",
      "Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the US based Council on Foreign Relations, described the 50.38% efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine as a \"disappointing\" result that had caught him by surprise.\n",
      "The results suggest Coronavac is less effective than alternative vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have an efficacy rate of about 95%.\n",
      "Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 91% effective, while the UK's vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has an average efficacy of 70%.\n",
      "The Sinovac vaccine is also less effective than its domestic Chinese competitor, developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, which it says is 79.34% effective.\n",
      "Despite the worse than anticipated results, Huang said the Sinovac vaccine would still be \"usable\" by helping to relieve pressures on healthcare systems while reducing potential deaths, given its higher efficacy for moderate and severe cases that would require medical treatment.\n",
      "However, its low overall efficacy could hinder Sinovac's ability to expand its market share globally, Huang said.\n",
      "Sinovac has signed deals to provide 46 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to Brazil, 50 million doses to Turkey and 7.5 million doses to Hong Kong. It'll also supply 40 million doses of vaccine bulk -- the vaccine concentrate before it is divided into vials -- to Indonesia for local production.\n",

      "By Nectar Gan and Tatiana Arias, CNN\n",
      "Published Jan 13, 2021 7:18:42 PM\n",
      "(CNN) -- A leading Chinese Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac Biotech was just 50.38% effective in late-stage trials in Brazil, significantly lower than earlier results showed, according to a statement published by the government of Sao Paulo Tuesday.\n",
      "While the number exceeds the threshold required for regulatory approval, it falls far below the 78% previously announced, raising questions as to the veracity of the data and fueling skepticism over the apparent lack of transparency regarding Chinese vaccines.\n",
      "Analysts said the efficacy rate of Sinovac's Coronavac vaccine in Brazil -- the lowest among its global competitors -- could affect international confidence in Chinese-made vaccines and hamper Beijing's effort to repair its image from its early mishandling of the initial outbreak by providing Covid-19 vaccines to developing countries.\n",
      "\"The Butantan Institute and the Government of Sao Paulo report that the coronavirus vaccine achieved a 50.38% overall efficacy rate in the clinical study conducted in Brazil, in addition to (an efficacy rate of) 78% for mild cases and 100% for moderate and severe cases of Covid-19. All rates are higher than the 50% level required by the WHO (World Health Organization),\" the statement released Tuesday said.\n",
      "The razor-thin margin for regulatory approval is likely to lead to concern among scientists, given that last week the Butantan institute released partial \"clinical efficacy\" results celebrating 78% to 100% efficacy in preventing infections.\n",
      "The state body financed the phase 3 trials of the vaccine, which involved 13,000 health workers across eight Brazilian states.\n",
      "\"Regarding the overall efficacy of the analysis, we met the requirements of the World Health Organization with 50.38%,\" Ricardo Palacios, medical director for clinical research at the Butantan biomedical center in Sao Paulo said Tuesday during a news conference.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "However, on Tuesday, high-ranking members of the Brazilian Health Ministry told CNN affiliate CNN Brasil that \"the effectiveness is borderline,\" and that because \"It is at the limit. We have to wait for ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) to evaluate.\"\n",
      "A representative of Sinovac said the company is discussing the result but declined to give further comment. The final efficacy rate of the vaccine will be determined by China's drug regulator, the National Medical Production Administration, according to the representative.\n",
      "Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the US based Council on Foreign Relations, described the 50.38% efficacy of the Sinovac vaccine as a \"disappointing\" result that had caught him by surprise.\n",
      "The results suggest Coronavac is less effective than alternative vaccines developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which have an efficacy rate of about 95%.\n",
      "Russia says its Sputnik V vaccine is 91% effective, while the UK's vaccine, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, has an average efficacy of 70%.\n",
      "The Sinovac vaccine is also less effective than its domestic Chinese competitor, developed by the state-owned Sinopharm, which it says is 79.34% effective.\n",
      "Despite the worse than anticipated results, Huang said the Sinovac vaccine would still be \"usable\" by helping to relieve pressures on healthcare systems while reducing potential deaths, given its higher efficacy for moderate and severe cases that would require medical treatment.\n",
      "However, its low overall efficacy could hinder Sinovac's ability to expand its market share globally, Huang said.\n",
      "Sinovac has signed deals to provide 46 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine to Brazil, 50 million doses to Turkey and 7.5 million doses to Hong Kong. It'll also supply 40 million doses of vaccine bulk -- the vaccine concentrate before it is divided into vials -- to Indonesia for local production.\n",
      "\"Since many countries are planning to order, or have already ordered Sinovac's vaccines, it might undermine people's willingness to take them, because people may question the usefulness of the vaccines,\" Huang said. \"It could be a potential stumbling block.\"\n",
      "A lack of transparency has been a major concern clouding Chinese-made vaccines, which Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to make \"a global public good.\"\n",

      "(CNN) -- Even before the pandemic hit, the Cherokee Nation was dealing with a crisis: the potential disappearance of its native language.\n",
      "Only about 2,000 people alive on this earth can speak the Cherokee language fluently. And as Covid-19 began to spread, that number started to dwindle.\n",
      "So when the Cherokee Nation began receiving shipments of the Covid-19 vaccine, the tribal government identified Cherokee speakers as among the first groups to be eligible for the shot.\n",
      "\"When you lose a speaker and you're a tribe that has only 2,000 fluent speakers left, you've lost something that isn't just irreplaceable, as all life is, but is really a national treasure,\" Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. told CNN. \"Whether they survive and whether they pass down their knowledge will help determine in a couple of generations if there is a Cherokee language left.\"\n",
      "Vaccinating Cherokee language speakers alongside frontline health care workers is just the latest effort the tribe has made during the pandemic to keep this treasured population safe.\n",
      "And in doing so, the Cherokee Nation is not only protecting some of most revered citizens, but also ensuring the survival of its culture and identity.\n",
      "In relative terms, the Cherokee Nation has fared much better than other tribes and many parts of the US in controlling the spread of the virus.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "The Cherokee Nation, with about 141,000 citizens living on its reservation in northeastern Oklahoma, has reported a total of more than 11,800 Covid-19 cases and 66 deaths as of January 8. But about 30 of the people lost were native Cherokee speakers, Hoskin said.\n",
      "\"When I took office, preserving our language and revitalizing it was a high priority,\" he said. \"In the midst of Covid, knowing what we're losing, it just tells me that that's the right priority and we need to emphasize it even more.\"\n",
      "The first 975 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine arrived in the Cherokee Nation on December 14. The next morning, the tribe started vaccinating frontline health care workers at its health complex in Tahlequah, Oklahoma.\n",
      "Three days later, the tribe began administering the shot to Cherokee language speakers.\n",
      "The Cherokee Nation already had a record of its living first language speakers, thanks to an effort Hoskin initiated in 2018 when he was the tribe's Secretary of State. So its staff started contacting those listed in the speaker roll book to let them know they could now schedule an appointment to receive the Covid-19 vaccine.\n",
      "More than 600 speakers have been vaccinated so far, according to the tribe. The aim is to vaccinate 1,000 by the end of the week.\n",
      "On January 4, the Cherokee Nation also announced it was beginning vaccinations for elders aged 65 and older.\n",
      "Prioritizing the vaccination of Cherokee speakers and elders has also had an unintended consequence: It has built trust in the vaccine among other citizens of the Cherokee Nation.\n",
      "Hoskin said he's seen some hesitation among Cherokee Nation citizens about taking the vaccine. But the tribe's decision to vaccinate native speakers early helped ease the anxieties that some people might have otherwise had, he added.\n",
      "\"People revere elders in the Cherokee Nation,\" he said. \"I think when they saw that group of people being made a high priority and celebrating it, that surely has built some confidence.\"\n",
      "Sandra Turner got her first vaccine dose in December and received her booster shot last week.\n",
      "Turner, 64, grew up speaking Cherokee at home in a family of 11 children. Until about first or second grade, she didn't even know English. And even then, she and the many other Cherokee students at her school would speak to each other in the language they knew best.\n",
      "Today, people like her are rare.\n",
      "Turner, who lives in Salina, Oklahoma, knows firsthand the threat that Covid-19 poses to her mother tongue. Just last week, she attended the funeral of her children's father, who died of the virus and spoke the language fluently like herself.\n",

      "\"We have been losing a lot of our fluent speakers due to the virus,\" she said. \"And I was ready. I said, 'I'm getting in line.'\"\n",

      "Ross, who lives in Fort Gibson, Oklahoma, is a translator for the Cherokee Nation. He's actively worked to preserve the language he grew up with, including getting Cherokee on Microsoft Office programs and making vaccine information from Pfizer and Moderna available in Cherokee.

      "(CNN) -- When she found a lump in her left breast during a routine self-check, Boston primary care physician Dr. Devon Quasha knew exactly what to do. She immediately scheduled a diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound at Massachusetts General Hospital for early January.\n",
      "Then the Moderna vaccine became available to health care professionals in the city. She received her first COVID-19 shot about a week before her scheduled mammogram.\n",
      "Quasha didn't notice much of a reaction to the vaccine at first, but a couple of days before her appointment her left arm began to hurt.\n",
      "Tender, swollen lumps developed under her left armpit, along with a large swelling above her collarbone -- all areas where the body has lymph nodes, the body's filters for germs.\n",
      "\"You have lymph nodes above and below your collarbone,\" Quasha said. \"You don't want to feel those. It was scary when I felt it.\"\n",
      "Lymph nodes contain immune cells that help fight invaders. That's why it made sense to Quasha that the nodes were reacting to the vaccine, building antibodies as they were designed to do. But she couldn't be sure.\n",
      "The swelling was only on the left side where she had gotten the shot -- the same side as the worrisome lump. Was it a reaction to the vaccine or another sign of breast cancer?\n",
      "After the ultrasound, Quasha's radiologist was concerned. She told Quasha she considered the lump she had felt in her breast to be of little significance, but the lymph nodes that showed up as white blobs on her mammogram were another matter.\n",
      "In non-pandemic times, that finding would set off alarm bells, requiring the need for further investigation, even an immediate biopsy. Yet Quasha had just had the vaccine. After talking it over with her, Quasha said her doctor decided not to do a biopsy at that time. Instead she told Quasha to come back for a follow-up ultrasound in six weeks.\n",
      "Similar scenarios had been happening in mammogram centers around the country. As radiologists compared notes with colleagues, word began to spread.\n",
      "\"We all started talking about it, and it was like a wildfire,\" said Dr. Connie Lehman, chief of breast imaging in Massachusetts General's department of radiology.\n",
      "\"I cannot tell you how many women are showing nodes on mammograms and people thought it was going to be not that common,\" said Lehman, who is also a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School.\n",

      "For Quasha, the knowledge that many women were experiencing the same type of reaction to the vaccine was a welcome relief from worry. After a discussion with her doctor, she said she no longer needs the follow-up screening.\n",

      "\"We need to take care of the large percentage of women who didn't get screened because of the shutdowns during Covid,\" she said. \"At Mass General alone, we failed to screen 15,000 women because of Covid, and we're still trying to get them back in.\n",
      "\"This isn't where I need to start doing axillary ultrasounds, because someone had a vaccine and the node swelled. It's just not being practical or pragmatic or putting our patient's needs first,\" she said.\n",

      "Published Aug 12, 2020 7:27:12 PM\n",
      "(CNN) — Russia raised eyebrows on Tuesday when it announced the world's first approved coronavirus vaccine for public use.\n",
      "President Vladimir Putin says his own daughter has already received it, but testing is yet to be completed and experts are skeptical about how quickly the vaccine has been registered.\n",
      "While details about the research behind the vaccine are limited, here's what we know so far.\n",
      "The vaccine was developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, using funding from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). The vaccine is named Sputnik V -- a reference to the 1957 Soviet Union satellite.\n",
      "Scientists conducted months of human trials but are yet to publish data and did not begin the crucial Phase 3 stage, which usually precedes approval, before the announcement on Tuesday.\n",
      "On Wednesday it was announced that a Phase 3 trial involving more than 2,000 people in Russia and several Middle Eastern and Latin American countries had begun. Typically this stage of trial involves testing on tens of thousands of people.\n",
      "Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said Tuesday that the number of people the vaccine had been tested on so far was the equivalent of a Phase 1 trial, which typically involves a small group and studies the safety of the vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The short answer is that we don't know. Russia has released no scientific data on its vaccine testing and CNN is unable to verify claims about its safety or effectiveness. But Russia says the vaccine has passed through Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials which were completed on August 1.\n",
      "A Phase 1 study typically focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and whether it elicits an immune response in a small number of people.\n",
      "\"We do not have any information whatsoever on whether this is safe,\" Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University of Nottingham, told CNN.\n",
      "Russia claims that volunteers in the Phase 1 and 2 trials felt well after taking the vaccine, and exhibited no unforeseen or unwanted side effects.\n",
      "Neal said that researchers were unlikely to have detected any rare side effects linked to the Gamaleya vaccine.\n",
      "\"You won't know about side effects without [widespread] testing, if they're rare. That's the point of a Phase 3 study,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I wouldn't take it, certainly not outside of a clinical trial right now,\" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.\n",
      "Without data and completed Phase 3 trials, Russia has not proven to the world Sputnik V works.\n",
      "\"I would think that it at least produces antibodies. What we don't know is if it protects people against infection,\" Neal told CNN.\n",
      "Russia has said that its vaccine is an adenoviral vector one. Adenoviruses cause the common cold, but in Covid-19 vaccines they're weakened and modified to deliver genetic material that codes for a protein from the novel coronavirus.\n",
      "The body then produces that protein and may produce an immune response against it but the method can cause problems.\n",
      "Sputnik V's makers say the vaccine induced a \"strong antibody and cellular immune response,\" in trial volunteers, according to the official website for the vaccine.\n",
      "\"Not a single participant of the current clinical trials got infected with Covid-19 after being administered with the vaccine,\" the statement adds.\n",
      "\"It's not clear how efficacious the Russian vaccine is going to be and whether or not people have some prior immunity to the adenovirus that they're using to deliver the coronavirus gene sequence,\" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.\n",
      "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expressed similar concerns.\n",
      "\"I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that,\" Fauci told Deborah Roberts of ABC News for a National Geographic event to broadcast Thursday. A portion of the interview was posted by National Geographic on Tuesday.\n",
      "In April, Russia enacted a law which eliminated the need for a Phase 3 vaccine trial before approval.\n",
      "Approval now means the coronavirus vaccine can be distributed even as Phase 3 tests get underway -- though practically speaking, mass-manufactured doses aren't expected to be ready for weeks.\n",
      "\"They're not as far ahead as other vaccines,\" Neal said, noting that Moderna and Oxford's vaccines have already begun Phase 3 trials.\n",
      "Critics say Russia's haste is partly due to political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray the country as a global scientific force.\n",
      "Russia is not alone when it comes to fast tracking -- China approved an experimental coronavirus vaccine in June for members of its military.\n",
      "And while its vaccine data from Phase 1 and 2 trials are yet to be published, US, UK and Canadian security officials warned in July that Russian cyber actors were targeting organizations involved in coronavirus vaccine development.\n",
      "Russia's Health Ministry has said the country's frontline medical staff and teachers will be the first vaccinated.\n",
      "The country plans to begin mass vaccination of citizens in October, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the RDIF told CNN on Tuesday.\n",
      "\"We will start massive vaccination of Russians in October. This vaccine will be available to other countries around November,\" Dmitriev told CNN's Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n",
      "At the end of July officials denied reports that members of the country's political and business elite -- including Putin -- had been given early access to the vaccine.\n",
      "Russia plans to mass produce the vaccine by September 2020.\n",
      "A lot of countries appear keen to try Sputnik V. Dmitriev said at a Tuesday press conference that Russia had \"received preliminary applications for over 1 billion doses of the vaccine from 20 countries.\"\n",
      "\"Countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia have displayed the greatest interest in the vaccine, and we are about to finalize a number of contracts for the purchase of the vaccine,\" he added.\n",
      "Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has publicly expressed his enthusiasm for the vaccine and claimed that he is willing to volunteer in further trials.\n",

      "By Zamira Rahim, CNN\n",
      "Published Aug 12, 2020 7:27:12 PM\n",
      "(CNN) — Russia raised eyebrows on Tuesday when it announced the world's first approved coronavirus vaccine for public use.\n",
      "President Vladimir Putin says his own daughter has already received it, but testing is yet to be completed and experts are skeptical about how quickly the vaccine has been registered.\n",
      "While details about the research behind the vaccine are limited, here's what we know so far.\n",
      "The vaccine was developed by the Moscow-based Gamaleya Institute, using funding from the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF). The vaccine is named Sputnik V -- a reference to the 1957 Soviet Union satellite.\n",
      "Scientists conducted months of human trials but are yet to publish data and did not begin the crucial Phase 3 stage, which usually precedes approval, before the announcement on Tuesday.\n",
      "On Wednesday it was announced that a Phase 3 trial involving more than 2,000 people in Russia and several Middle Eastern and Latin American countries had begun. Typically this stage of trial involves testing on tens of thousands of people.\n",
      "Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said Tuesday that the number of people the vaccine had been tested on so far was the equivalent of a Phase 1 trial, which typically involves a small group and studies the safety of the vaccine.\n",
      "\n",
      "The short answer is that we don't know. Russia has released no scientific data on its vaccine testing and CNN is unable to verify claims about its safety or effectiveness. But Russia says the vaccine has passed through Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials which were completed on August 1.\n",
      "A Phase 1 study typically focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and whether it elicits an immune response in a small number of people.\n",
      "\"We do not have any information whatsoever on whether this is safe,\" Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor of the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases, University of Nottingham, told CNN.\n",
      "Russia claims that volunteers in the Phase 1 and 2 trials felt well after taking the vaccine, and exhibited no unforeseen or unwanted side effects.\n",
      "Neal said that researchers were unlikely to have detected any rare side effects linked to the Gamaleya vaccine.\n",
      "\"You won't know about side effects without [widespread] testing, if they're rare. That's the point of a Phase 3 study,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I wouldn't take it, certainly not outside of a clinical trial right now,\" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.\n",
      "Without data and completed Phase 3 trials, Russia has not proven to the world Sputnik V works.\n",
      "\"I would think that it at least produces antibodies. What we don't know is if it protects people against infection,\" Neal told CNN.\n",
      "Russia has said that its vaccine is an adenoviral vector one. Adenoviruses cause the common cold, but in Covid-19 vaccines they're weakened and modified to deliver genetic material that codes for a protein from the novel coronavirus.\n",
      "The body then produces that protein and may produce an immune response against it but the method can cause problems.\n",
      "Sputnik V's makers say the vaccine induced a \"strong antibody and cellular immune response,\" in trial volunteers, according to the official website for the vaccine.\n",
      "\"Not a single participant of the current clinical trials got infected with Covid-19 after being administered with the vaccine,\" the statement adds.\n",
      "\"It's not clear how efficacious the Russian vaccine is going to be and whether or not people have some prior immunity to the adenovirus that they're using to deliver the coronavirus gene sequence,\" Gottlieb told CNN Tuesday.\n",
      "Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expressed similar concerns.\n",
      "\"I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective. I seriously doubt that they've done that,\" Fauci told Deborah Roberts of ABC News for a National Geographic event to broadcast Thursday. A portion of the interview was posted by National Geographic on Tuesday.\n",
      "In April, Russia enacted a law which eliminated the need for a Phase 3 vaccine trial before approval.\n",
      "Approval now means the coronavirus vaccine can be distributed even as Phase 3 tests get underway -- though practically speaking, mass-manufactured doses aren't expected to be ready for weeks.\n",
      "\"They're not as far ahead as other vaccines,\" Neal said, noting that Moderna and Oxford's vaccines have already begun Phase 3 trials.\n",
      "Critics say Russia's haste is partly due to political pressure from the Kremlin, which is keen to portray the country as a global scientific force.\n",
      "Russia is not alone when it comes to fast tracking -- China approved an experimental coronavirus vaccine in June for members of its military.\n",
      "And while its vaccine data from Phase 1 and 2 trials are yet to be published, US, UK and Canadian security officials warned in July that Russian cyber actors were targeting organizations involved in coronavirus vaccine development.\n",
      "Russia's Health Ministry has said the country's frontline medical staff and teachers will be the first vaccinated.\n",
      "The country plans to begin mass vaccination of citizens in October, Kirill Dmitriev, CEO of the RDIF told CNN on Tuesday.\n",
      "\"We will start massive vaccination of Russians in October. This vaccine will be available to other countries around November,\" Dmitriev told CNN's Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n",
      "At the end of July officials denied reports that members of the country's political and business elite -- including Putin -- had been given early access to the vaccine.\n",
      "Russia plans to mass produce the vaccine by September 2020.\n",
      "A lot of countries appear keen to try Sputnik V. Dmitriev said at a Tuesday press conference that Russia had \"received preliminary applications for over 1 billion doses of the vaccine from 20 countries.\"\n",
      "\"Countries in Latin America, the Middle East and Asia have displayed the greatest interest in the vaccine, and we are about to finalize a number of contracts for the purchase of the vaccine,\" he added.\n",
      "Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte has publicly expressed his enthusiasm for the vaccine and claimed that he is willing to volunteer in further trials.\n",
      "\"I will volunteer to receive it in public. I will be the first to be experimented on,\" Duterte said during his address to the Philippines late Monday broadcast by state-run RTVM.\n",
      "As it stands, the Russian vaccine is unlikely to be meet approval regulations for European Union countries and in the US, will need the FDA's approval.\n",

      "(CNN) —  Anyone thinking a vaccine will quickly end the coronavirus pandemic shouldn't get their hopes up. Instead, they should wear a mask — which is probably even more effective, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n",
      "While a \"very limited supply\" of a Covid-19 vaccine might be ready in November or December, it \"will have to be prioritized,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told a Senate appropriations subcommittee Wednesday.\n",
      "\"It will be those first responders and those at greatest risk for death, and then eventually that will expand,\" he said.\n",
      "\"If you're asking me when is it going to be generally available to the American public, so we can begin to take advantage of vaccine to get back to our regular life, I think we're probably looking at third, late second quarter, third quarter 2021.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "On top of that, \"in order to have enough of us immunized so we have immunity, I think it's going to take us six to nine months,\" he said.\n",
      "Then there's the issue that needs to be urgently addressed: people who are hesitant to get the vaccine, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins said Wednesday.\n",
      "\"Those who are vaccine hesitant have had their hesitancy enhanced by a variety of things that are happening right now, particularly the unfortunate mix of science and politics,\" Collins said at an event hosted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.\n",
      "A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than half of respondents -- 54% -- said they would not get the vaccine if it was available for free before the November 3 presidential election. Along party lines, 60% of Republicans and 56% of independents said they would not. Half of Democrats said they would.\n",
      "\"I don't want to have us, a year from now, having a conversation about how we have in our hands the solution to the worst pandemic of more than 100 years, but we haven't been able to actually convince people to take charge of it,\" Collins said.\n",
      "And distrust in government agencies is hindering surveillance of Covid-19 spread, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\n",
      "\"It is very challenging in many areas today, where we're seeing people who do not want to participate in any kind of follow up with regard to surveillance, because of their distrust of government and the public health system,\" c said during an American Public Health Association webinar.\n",
      "Surveillance helps public health officials by collecting information on infected people, such as where they were exposed and who they've been in contact with, and the course of their illness.\n",
      "Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, said the variability in how the coronavirus affects people has helped fuel misunderstandings about who can spread the virus and when.\n",
      "At least 40% of patients have no symptoms, while some stay ill for months on end, Fauci said.\n",
      "\"One of the things we're dealing with in this country is a real lack of understanding of the importance of everybody trying to prevent getting infected rather than inadvertently... propagating the outbreak...\" Fauci said during a virtual panel sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute.\n",
      "Of all the viral diseases and emerging infections that he's encountered throughout his career, Fauci said he has \"never seen anything with a range\" like this virus.\n",
      "\"It's just completely unique to see that degree of variability of a single microbe, which means there are things that are determining that, that we still at this point don't understand,\" he said.\n",
      "But Redfield said Americans already have a weapon he believes could be more effective against Covid-19: face masks.\n",
      "\"These face masks are the most important, powerful public health tool we have,\" Redfield said, holding up a blue face mask.\n",
      "\"If we did it for six, eight, 10, 12 weeks, we'd bring this pandemic under control,\" he said.\n",
      "\"I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take a Covid vaccine, because the immunogenicity may be 70%. And if I don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me. This face mask will.\"\n",
      "Yet time and again, people gather and socialize without wearing face masks -- sometimes leading to tragic results.\n",
      "More than 6.6 million people have been infected with Covid-19 in the US, and more than 196,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n",
      "A wedding in Maine is linked to 176 Covid-19 cases and the deaths of seven people who didn't attend the celebration -- showing just how easily and quickly coronavirus can spread at social gatherings, public health experts say.\n",
      "For months, doctors have stressed the importance of wearing masks, social distancing, and avoiding large gatherings.\n",
      "But outbreaks have stemmed from Memorial Day events, Fourth of July celebrations and a massive motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.\n",
      "The wedding in Millinocket on August 7 had about 65 guests, a violation of the state's 50-person limit for indoor events, the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n",
      "The event is linked to outbreaks that have unfolded at a nursing home and a jail, both more than 100 miles away from the wedding venue, among people who had only secondary or tertiary contact with an attendee.\n",
      "Residents at Maplecrest Rehabilitation and Living Center accounted for 39 cases tied to the wedding and six of the seven deaths thus far, Maine CDC Director Dr. Nirav D. Shah said.\n",
      "\"The virus favors gatherings,\" Shah added. \"It does not distinguish between happy events like a wedding celebration, or sad farewells, like a funeral.\"\n",
      "Despite such somber warnings, about 1,500 people descended on a New Jersey boardwalk house featured in MTV's \"Jersey Shore\" on Monday night, ending in eight arrests, Seaside Heights police said.\n",
      "The event was organized by a group of YouTube pranksters, according to Seaside Heights Police Detective Steve Korman, and officials say they are now worried about how they will track possible infections among more than a thousand people.\n",
      "Outbreaks keep cropping up at colleges and universities, prompting some to go to virtual learning again.\n",
      "More than 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported at colleges and universities in all 50 states.\n",
      "Citing a significant rise in cases among students, the University of Colorado Boulder announced a 14-day quarantine period for students living within the city.\n",
      "The University of Arizona is taking a similar approach, urging students to shelter in place until the end of the month after a large number of positive cases. The university reported 261 positive cases on Monday, according to the school's coronavirus dashboard.\n",
      "At the University of Missouri, two students were expelled and three were suspended for violating rules that require students who test positive to isolate and comply with social distancing.\n",
      "\"These students willfully put others at risk, and that is never acceptable. We will not let the actions of a few take away the opportunity for in-person learning that more than 8,000 faculty and staff have worked so hard to accomplish for the more than 30,000 MU students,\" the university said in a statement Tuesday\n",
      "Officials are trying to prepare the public for a pandemic-altered life for a few more months -- if not years.\n",
      "Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, chief science officer at the World Health Organization in Geneva, said the world might not be able to return to \"pre-Covid\" life until 2022.\n",

      "Published Nov 22, 2020 9:49:59 PM\n",
      "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, November 22) — Department of Science and Technology Secretary Fortunato Dela Peña said Sunday he has no knowledge about the COVID-19 vaccine supposedly received by Senator Panfilo Lacson and House Majority Leader Ferdinand Martin Romualdez.\n",
      "Dela Peña said he has no information about the vaccine, which Senate President Vicente Sotto III claimed was administered to Lacson and Romualdez recently.\n",
      "\"Hindi ko pa alam 'yun,\" Dela Peña said in an online press briefing. \"Lalo 'yan hindi ko alam ano ang pangalan. So, mahirap aralin.\"\n",
      "[Translation: I don't know anything about it, especially since I don't know the name of the vaccine. It would be hard to determine.]\n",

      "(CNN) -- Covid-19 vaccines will be distributed to vulnerable populations within days of an emergency use authorization (EUA), an official said, as the US wrestles with an all-time high of daily new cases.\n",
      "\"We will start to have shots in arms within 96 hours of EUA,\" Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday. \"That's what I believe with all my heart.\"\n",
      "Pfizer and Moderna both have vaccine candidates awaiting EUAs, and the US Food and Drug Administration has confirmed Pfizer's safety and efficacy ahead of a Thursday approval meeting. The anticipated approval comes as the US suffers spikes in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths.\n",
      "The US has averaged 206,152 new cases a day over the last seven days -- the highest number of cases in the pandemic so far. And Tuesday, 104,600 people were hospitalized with the virus, according to The COVID Tracking Project, a record that has been set and broken over and over in recent weeks. In total, 286,232 people have died of the virus and more than 15.1 million people have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n",
      "The wider public will likely have to continue to grapple with spikes from the holiday season until vaccines are widely available in 2021. But officials are racing to distribute vaccines in the coming days for priority populations -- the elderly and health care workers.\n",
      "While it will be a \"herculean task,\" Perna said that he is confident that, with the planning from the CDC and collaboration from partners, \"we will be able to execute this vaccine very efficiently, but more importantly, effectively.\"\n",
      "The impacts of the pandemic are spread across the country, Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services Admiral Brett Giroir told CNN Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Los Angeles County confirmed a total of 8,000 coronavirus deaths and over 3,000 hospitalizations on Tuesday, which the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health called a \"tragic milestone\" in a news release. And Pennsylvania recorded its highest number of coronavirus hospitalizations Tuesday.\n",
      "As local leaders manage rising cases, many are also getting their vaccine plans in order.\n",
      "In Illinois, though the first delivery is expected next week, it will take months to roll out a vaccine, even to priority groups, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) said during a news conference Tuesday.\n",
      "Delaware also anticipates receiving its first shipment next week. Dr. Karyl Rattay, with Delaware's Division of Public Health, announced Tuesday that the state is expecting nearly 9,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine around December 15 and more than 8,000 of Moderna's the following week.\n",
      "Once Minnesota gets its first shipment of vaccines expected next week, they will be sent directly to key hospitals or \"hubs\" and then be delivered to smaller clinics, Gov. Tim Walz said during a news briefing.\n",
      "Minnesota, Illinois, Mississippi and Delaware have said health care workers and long-term care residents will be the first to receive vaccinations.\n",
      "But for vaccines to be effective, the public has to use them -- and officials are urging participation in inoculations.\n",
      "\"Vaccines that are not used are useless,\" Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday. \"Vaccination is what's important.\"\n",
      "Their development has been fast, but experts say that doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective or unsafe.\n",
      "Slaoui said that the speed came from taking operational and financial risks to develop the vaccine, not cutting scientific corners.\n",
      "\"The first thing is to point out that the speed has nothing to do with compromising safety or scientific integrity,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said. \"It's due to the extraordinary and exquisite advances in vaccine platform technology which has allowed us to do things in weeks to months that formerly took years, several years.\n",

      "By Madeline Holcombe, CNN\n",
      "Published Dec 9, 2020 9:06:20 PM\n",
      "(CNN) -- Covid-19 vaccines will be distributed to vulnerable populations within days of an emergency use authorization (EUA), an official said, as the US wrestles with an all-time high of daily new cases.\n",
      "\"We will start to have shots in arms within 96 hours of EUA,\" Gen. Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday. \"That's what I believe with all my heart.\"\n",
      "Pfizer and Moderna both have vaccine candidates awaiting EUAs, and the US Food and Drug Administration has confirmed Pfizer's safety and efficacy ahead of a Thursday approval meeting. The anticipated approval comes as the US suffers spikes in coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths.\n",
      "The US has averaged 206,152 new cases a day over the last seven days -- the highest number of cases in the pandemic so far. And Tuesday, 104,600 people were hospitalized with the virus, according to The COVID Tracking Project, a record that has been set and broken over and over in recent weeks. In total, 286,232 people have died of the virus and more than 15.1 million people have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n",
      "The wider public will likely have to continue to grapple with spikes from the holiday season until vaccines are widely available in 2021. But officials are racing to distribute vaccines in the coming days for priority populations -- the elderly and health care workers.\n",
      "While it will be a \"herculean task,\" Perna said that he is confident that, with the planning from the CDC and collaboration from partners, \"we will be able to execute this vaccine very efficiently, but more importantly, effectively.\"\n",
      "The impacts of the pandemic are spread across the country, Assistant Secretary for Health and Human Services Admiral Brett Giroir told CNN Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Los Angeles County confirmed a total of 8,000 coronavirus deaths and over 3,000 hospitalizations on Tuesday, which the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health called a \"tragic milestone\" in a news release. And Pennsylvania recorded its highest number of coronavirus hospitalizations Tuesday.\n",
      "As local leaders manage rising cases, many are also getting their vaccine plans in order.\n",
      "In Illinois, though the first delivery is expected next week, it will take months to roll out a vaccine, even to priority groups, Dr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) said during a news conference Tuesday.\n",
      "Delaware also anticipates receiving its first shipment next week. Dr. Karyl Rattay, with Delaware's Division of Public Health, announced Tuesday that the state is expecting nearly 9,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine around December 15 and more than 8,000 of Moderna's the following week.\n",
      "Once Minnesota gets its first shipment of vaccines expected next week, they will be sent directly to key hospitals or \"hubs\" and then be delivered to smaller clinics, Gov. Tim Walz said during a news briefing.\n",
      "Minnesota, Illinois, Mississippi and Delaware have said health care workers and long-term care residents will be the first to receive vaccinations.\n",
      "But for vaccines to be effective, the public has to use them -- and officials are urging participation in inoculations.\n",
      "\"Vaccines that are not used are useless,\" Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, said Tuesday. \"Vaccination is what's important.\"\n",
      "Their development has been fast, but experts say that doesn't mean the vaccines are ineffective or unsafe.\n",
      "Slaoui said that the speed came from taking operational and financial risks to develop the vaccine, not cutting scientific corners.\n",
      "\"The first thing is to point out that the speed has nothing to do with compromising safety or scientific integrity,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said. \"It's due to the extraordinary and exquisite advances in vaccine platform technology which has allowed us to do things in weeks to months that formerly took years, several years.\n",
      "There is concern that many Americans will be skeptical about getting vaccines, but Fauci acknowledged a \"painful disparity\" in the prevalence of the virus among African Americans as well as a \"reluctance and skepticism about getting vaccinated.\"\n",
      "\"I will tell you that I myself will be perfectly comfortable in taking the vaccine and I would recommend it to my family,\" he said.\n",

      "(CNN) — An Alaska healthcare worker who suffered an allergic reaction to Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine on Tuesday felt flushed within the first 10 minutes of receiving the vaccine, and later reported symptoms including shortness of breath and elevated heart rate, doctors said Wednesday.\n",
      "The case is the first allergic reaction to the vaccine to be reported in the US, although health officials said they are expecting the occasional allergic reaction -- and are prepared to treat anyone suffering from one.\n",
      "\"We expected that a side effect like this could occur after reports of anaphylaxis were made in England after people there received the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine,\" said Alaska's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink. \"All sites that are approved to provide vaccinations in Alaska must have medications on hand to deal with an allergic reaction and that was the case in Juneau.\"\n",
      "The worker was among staff being vaccinated at Bartlett Regional Hospital in Juneau as part of the rollout of Pfizer's vaccine across the country Tuesday.\n",
      "According to Dr. Lindy Jones, an attending physician at Bartlett Memorial Hospital, the worker was initially held in the vaccine monitoring area right after receiving the shot, and took a Benadryl. When she reported shortness of breath, she was taken to the emergency room.\n",
      "When Jones saw her in the hospital, he said she was experiencing shortness of breath and an elevated heart rate, and had developed a rash covering her face and torso.\n",
      "\"I was concerned about an anaphylactic reaction so gave her the standard treatment of a dose of intramuscular epinephrine and she responded immediately,\" Jones told a news briefing. She was also given antihistamines.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",
      "She still had an elevated heart rate and was breathing fast -- a sign of an allergic reaction -- so Jones gave her another dose of epinephrine, as well as steroids \"which is another standard bread and butter treatment for adverse anaphylactic reactions,\" he said.\n",
      "Jones said the worker, who was not further identified to protect her privacy, had no previous history of allergies to vaccines. She is almost recovered after a night in the intensive care unit.\n",
      "\"She was still enthusiastic that she got the vaccine and the benefits it would give her in the future,\" Jones said.\n",
      "\"This was an instance where the system worked very well,\" Dr. Jay Butler of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the news briefing.\n",

      "He noted there were two reported cases of allergic reaction in Britain, which rolled out the vaccine earlier this month.\n",
      "\"There were obviously several people in the United Kingdom who had had a severe allergic reaction to this vaccine and had a history of severe allergic reaction,\" said Offit, who is director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n",

      "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, December 14) — The government is hoping to finalize the deal with Chinese vaccine manufacturer Sinovac Biotech to supply the Philippines with 25 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by March 2021, appointed czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said on Monday.\n",
      "He said the meeting with Sinovac officials last week was substantial, with Philippine officials laying down the country's demands.\n",
      "\"We have already conveyed our needs. Sabi namin 25 million for 2021, Sinovac only... We want to finalize this week our final negotiations so we can firm up the head of terms and also we are looking at the exact time of distribution,\" he said in a media briefing.\n",
      "Once the agreement is secured, the National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer said the company is confident that its vaccine candidate CoronaVac will arrive in the Philippines in April, but authorities are negotiating to have it by March.\n",
      "Aside from Sinovac, Galvez said the Philippines is also looking at procuring other China-made vaccines from Sinopharm and CanSino. But he said they are leaning towards prioritizing the deal with Sinovac due to affordability and production capability.\n",
      "\"Three times lower siya sa price ng Sinopharm. Capable siya mag-produce para sa atin, kung magkaroon ng magandang negotiation, is 20 million,\" the official added.\n",
      "Criticized for the Philippine government's penchant for picking drugs made in China, envoy Chito Sta. Romana said the confidence comes from the fact that the country has vaccinated about one million people using at least 3 shots — two from CNBG and one by Sinovac. But he stressed that these manufacturers still need to secure the approval of the Food and Drug Administration in the Philippines before their vaccines can be administered in the country.\n",
      "ADVERTISEMENT\n",

      "Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, December 14) — The government is hoping to finalize the deal with Chinese vaccine manufacturer Sinovac Biotech to supply the Philippines with 25 million doses of coronavirus vaccines by March 2021, appointed czar Carlito Galvez Jr. said on Monday.\n",
      "He said the meeting with Sinovac officials last week was substantial, with Philippine officials laying down the country's demands.\n",
      "\"We have already conveyed our needs. Sabi namin 25 million for 2021, Sinovac only... We want to finalize this week our final negotiations so we can firm up the head of terms and also we are looking at the exact time of distribution,\" he said in a media briefing.\n",
      "Once the agreement is secured, the National Task Force against COVID-19 chief implementer said the company is confident that its vaccine candidate CoronaVac will arrive in the Philippines in April, but authorities are negotiating to have it by March.\n",
      "Aside from Sinovac, Galvez said the Philippines is also looking at procuring other China-made vaccines from Sinopharm and CanSino. But he said they are leaning towards prioritizing the deal with Sinovac due to affordability and production capability.\n",
      "\"Three times lower siya sa price ng Sinopharm. Capable siya mag-produce para sa atin, kung magkaroon ng magandang negotiation, is 20 million,\" the official added.\n",
      "Criticized for the Philippine government's penchant for picking drugs made in China, envoy Chito Sta. Romana said the confidence comes from the fact that the country has vaccinated about one million people using at least 3 shots — two from CNBG and one by Sinovac. But he stressed that these manufacturers still need to secure the approval of the Food and Drug Administration in the Philippines before their vaccines can be administered in the country.\n",

      "Ambassador Peter MacArthur tweeted that Anita Quidangen, who has been working at a Canadian long-term care facility for nearly three decades, is \"originally from the Philippines.\" He called her a \"healthcare hero,\" who has worked \"tirelessly throughout COVID-19, sometimes on double shifts.\"\n",
      "Quidangen is the first person to be vaccinated in the Canadian province of Ontario, as the country began rolling out an initial 30,000 doses.\n",
      "In a Facebook post, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Quidangen and all frontline workers for their sacrifices amid the pandemic.\n",
      "A video he shared also showed those present during the monumental vaccination broke into applause after Quidangen received her shot.\n",
      "\"These vaccinations mark a big step forward in our fight against this virus,\" Trudeau wrote. \"But they don't mean we're out of the woods,\" he added, urging citizens to remain vigilant and continue following health protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "Canada earlier said it expects to receive about 249,000 vaccines before year-end, but is awaiting at least 20 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech.\n",
      "It also announced it would spend about $400 million more to help developing countries access testing, therapeutics and vaccines. Federal officials said they have so far contributed more than $800 million in the global effort to help developing countries cope with COVID-19.\n",
      "The country has logged over 472,000 confirmed cases, placing just one notch above the Philippines in the global list, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. Of the total infected in Canada, 13,570 died while 385,021 were able to recover.\n",

      "[TRANSLATION: We are using different pathways here. First, there are collaboration agreements we are exploring for clinical trials with institutions…”]\n",
      "Dela Peña said some of the countries their group is having discussions with are China, India, Japan, Canada, and the United States – this is aside from their meetings with Russia, which recently offered their vaccine to the Philippines. Russian Ambassador to the Philippines Igor Khovaev reiterated that there is “nothing to hide” about the Sputnik-V coronavirus jab, saying data is available about the vaccine.\n",
      "READ: Russia has nothing to hide about Sputnik V, says envoy\n",
      "Sec. Dela Peña also said clinical trials for Sputnik-V will commence in October and may end by May of 2021 – same as the earliest date Malacañang announced earlier this week about how soon President Rodrigo Duterte can get vaccinated with the Gamaleya Institute-made vaccine.\n",
      "“Mahaba-habang proseso dahil iaanalyze pa ng experts dito yung data na ibinibigay nila bago tayong magsimula ng clinical trials,” Dela Peña said.\n",
      "[TRANSLATION: This will be a long process because experts will analyze the data they (Russia) will give before we start clinical trials.]\n",
      "The secretary also said the vaccine will have to be approved by the Philippine Food and Drug Administration or FDA before it can be used.\n",
      "In the meantime, the DOST is also waiting on the final list of vaccines from the World Health Organization which would be used for trials in the Philippines.\n",
      "Six vaccines from China, the US, and the UK are currently in the third stage of clinical trials.\n",
      "Dela Peña said three hospitals have been eyed for vaccine trials: the Philippine General Hospital (PGH) and Manila Doctor’s Hospital – both in the nation’s capital, and the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Muntinlupa City, also the Philippines’ premier coronavirus testing facility.\n",
